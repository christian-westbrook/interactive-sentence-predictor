what
in

will
you
require

most

crave
no
more
than
what
your

nor
will
you
tender
less
king
lear
right
noble
burgundy
when
she
was
dear
to
us
we
did
hold
her
so
but
now
her
price
is
sir
there
she
stands
if
aught
within
that
little
seeming
substance
or
all
of
it
with
our
displeasure
pieced
and
nothing
more
may
fitly
like
your
grace
there
and
she
is
yours
burgundy
know
no
answer
king
lear
will
you
with
those
infirmities
she
owes
unfriended
new
adopted
to
our
hate
with
our
curse
and
with
our
oath
take
her
or
leave
her
burgundy
pardon
me
royal
sir
election
makes
not
up
on
such
conditions
king
lear
then
leave
her
sir
for
by
the
power
that
made
me
tell
you
all
her
wealth
to
king

for
you
great

would
not
from
your

make
such
stray
to
match
you
where
hate
therefore
beseech
you
to
avert
your
liking
more
worthier
way
than
on
wretch
whom
nature
is
ashamed
almost
to
acknowledge
hers
king

this
is
most
strange
that
she
that
even
but
now
was
your
best
object
the
argument
of
your
praise
balm
of
your
age
most
best
most
dearest
should
in
this
trice
of

commit
thing
so
monstrous
to
dismantle
so
many
folds
of
favour
sure
her
offence
must
be
of
such
unnatural
degree
that
monsters
it
or
your
fore
affection
into
taint
which
to
believe
of
her
must
be
faith
that
reason
without
miracle
could
never
plant
in
me
cordelia
yet
beseech
your
majesty
if
for
want
that
glib
and
oily
art
to
speak
and
purpose
not
since
what
well
intend
before
speak
that
you
make
known
it
is
no
vicious
blot
murder
or
foulness
no
unchaste
action
or
step
that
hath
deprived
me
of
your
grace
and
favour
but
even
for
want
of
that
for
which
am
richer
still
soliciting
eye
and
such
tongue
as
am
glad
have
not
though
not
to
have
it
hath
lost
me
in
your

better
thou
hadst
not
been
born
than
not
to
have
pleased
me
better
king

is
it
but
this
tardiness
in

which
often
leaves
the
history
unspoke
that
it
intends
to
do
my

what
say
