An '''aromatic hydrocarbon''' or '''arene'''&lt;ref&gt;Definition IUPAC [[Gold Book]] [http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00435.html Link]&lt;/ref&gt; (or sometimes '''aryl hydrocarbon''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://diss.kib.ki.se/2003/91-7349-549-2/thesis.pdf Mechanisms of Activation of the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor] by Maria Backlund, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[hydrocarbon]] with [[sigma bond]]s and delocalized [[pi electron]]s between carbon atoms forming a circle. In contrast, [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] hydrocarbons lack this delocalization. The term 'aromatic' was assigned before the physical mechanism determining [[aromaticity]] was discovered; the term was coined as such simply because many of the compounds have a sweet or pleasant odour. The configuration of six carbon atoms in aromatic compounds is known as a benzene ring, after the simplest possible such hydrocarbon, [[benzene]]. Aromatic hydrocarbons can be ''monocyclic'' (MAH) or ''polycyclic'' (PAH).

Some non-benzene-based compounds called '''heteroarenes''', which follow [[Hückel's rule]] (for monocyclic rings: when the number of its π-electrons equals 4''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2, where ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, 1, 2, 3,…), are also called aromatic compounds. In these compounds, at least one carbon atom is replaced by one of the [[heteroatom]]s [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], or [[sulfur]]. Examples of non-benzene compounds with aromatic properties are [[furan]], a heterocyclic compound with a five-membered ring that includes a single oxygen atom, and [[pyridine]], a heterocyclic compound with a six-membered ring containing one nitrogen atom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-aromatic.html HighBeam Encyclopedia: aromatic compound]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|aromaticity}}
[[Benzene]], C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, is the simplest aromatic hydrocarbon, and it was the first one named as such. The nature of its bonding was first recognized by [[August Kekulé]] in the 19th century. Each carbon atom in the hexagonal cycle has four electrons to share. One goes to the hydrogen atom, and one each to the two neighbouring carbons. This leaves one electron to share with one of the same two neighbouring carbon atoms, thus creating a double bond with one carbon and leaving a single bond with the other, which is why the benzene molecule is drawn with alternating single and double bonds around the hexagon.

The structure is alternatively illustrated as a circle around the inside of the ring to show six electrons floating around in delocalized molecular orbitals the size of the ring itself. This depiction represents the equivalent nature of the six carbon–carbon bonds all of [[bond order]] 1.5; the equivalency is explained by [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance form]]s. The electrons are visualized as floating above and below the ring with the electromagnetic fields they generate acting to keep the ring flat.

General properties of aromatic hydrocarbons:
# They display [[aromaticity]]
# The carbon–hydrogen ratio is high
# They burn with a strong sooty yellow flame because of the high carbon–hydrogen ratio
# They undergo [[electrophilic substitution reaction]]s and [[nucleophilic aromatic substitution]]s

The circle symbol for aromaticity was introduced by [[Robert Robinson (organic chemist)|Sir Robert Robinson]] and his student James Armit in 1925&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=James Wilkins |last1=Armit |first2=Robert |last2=Robinson|author2-link=Robert Robinson (organic chemist) |date=1925 |title=Polynuclear heterocyclic aromatic types. Part II. Some anhydronium bases |journal=[[J. Chem. Soc. Trans.]] |volume=127 |pages=1604–1618}}&lt;/ref&gt; and popularized starting in 1959 by the Morrison &amp; Boyd textbook on organic chemistry. The proper use of the symbol is debated; it is used to describe any cyclic π system in some publications, or only those π systems that obey [[Hückel's rule]] in others. Jensen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=William B. |last=Jensen |date=April 2009 |url=http://www.che.uc.edu/jensen/W.%20B.%20Jensen/Reprints/157.%20Aromaticity%20Circle.pdf |title=The circle symbol for aromaticity |journal=[[J. Chem. Educ.]] |volume=86|issue=4 |pages=423–424|bibcode=2009JChEd..86..423J |doi=10.1021/ed086p423 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that, in line with Robinson's original proposal, the use of the circle symbol should be limited to monocyclic 6 π-electron systems. In this way the circle symbol for a six-center six-electron bond can be compared to the Y symbol for a [[three-center two-electron bond]].

==Arene synthesis==
A reaction that forms an arene compound from an unsaturated or partially unsaturated cyclic precursor is simply called an '''[[aromatization]]'''. Many laboratory methods exist for the [[organic synthesis]] of arenes from non-arene precursors. Many methods rely on [[cycloaddition]] reactions. [[Alkyne trimerization]] describes the [2+2+2] cyclization of three alkynes, in the [[Dötz reaction]] an alkyne, carbon monoxide and a chromium carbene complex are the reactants. [[Diels–Alder reaction]]s of [[alkyne]]s with [[pyrone]] or [[cyclopentadienone]] with expulsion of [[carbon dioxide]] or carbon monoxide also form arene compounds. In [[Bergman cyclization]] the reactants are an [[enyne]] plus a hydrogen donor.

Another set of methods is the aromatization of [[cyclohexane]]s and other aliphatic rings: reagents are catalysts used in [[hydrogenation]] such as platinum, palladium and nickel (reverse hydrogenation), [[quinone]]s and the elements [[sulfur]] and [[selenium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{March3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arene reactions==
Arenes are reactants in many organic reactions.

===Aromatic substitution===
In aromatic substitution one [[substituent]] on the arene ring, usually hydrogen, is replaced by another substituent. The two main types are [[electrophilic aromatic substitution]] when the active reagent is an electrophile and [[nucleophilic aromatic substitution]] when the reagent is a nucleophile. In [[radical-nucleophilic aromatic substitution]] the active reagent is a radical. An example of electrophilic aromatic substitution is the nitration of [[salicylic acid]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Coupling reactions===
In [[coupling reaction]]s a metal catalyses a coupling between two formal radical fragments. Common coupling reactions with arenes result in the formation of new [[carbon–carbon bond]]s e.g., alkylarenes, vinyl arenes, biraryls, new [[carbon–nitrogen bond]]s (anilines) or new [[carbon–oxygen bond]]s (aryloxy compounds). An example is the direct arylation of [[perfluorobenzenes]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Hydrogenation===
[[Hydrogenation]] of arenes create saturated rings. The compound [[1-naphthol]] is completely reduced to a mixture of [[decalin]]-ol [[isomer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth|title=1-Naphthol |last1=Meyers |first1=A. I. |last2=Beverung |first2=W. N. |last3=Gault|first3=R. |collvol=6 |collvolpage=371 |volume=51 |page=103 |date=1971 |prep=CV6P0371}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[Image:NaphtolHydrogenation.svg|500px|1-naphthol hydrogenation]]
The compound [[resorcinol]], hydrogenated with [[Raney nickel]] in presence of aqueous [[sodium hydroxide]] forms an [[enolate]] which is alkylated with [[methyl iodide]] to 2-methyl-1,3-cyclohexandione:&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth|title=Ethyl Indole-2-carboxylate |last1=Noland |first1=Wayland E. |last2=Baude |first2=Frederic J. |collvol=5 |collvolpage=743 |volume=41 |page=56 |date=1961 |prep=CV5P0567}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[Image:ResorcinolHydrogenation.svg|600px|Resorcinol hydrogenation]]

===Cycloadditions===
[[Cycloaddition]] reaction are not common. Unusual thermal Diels–Alder reactivity of arenes can be found in the [[Wagner-Jauregg reaction]]. Other photochemical cycloaddition reactions with alkenes occur through [[excimer]]s.

== Benzene and derivatives of benzene ==
Benzene derivatives have from one to six [[substituent]]s attached to the central benzene core. Examples of benzene compounds with just one substituent are [[phenol]], which carries a [[hydroxyl]] group, and [[toluene]] with a [[methyl]] group. When there is more than one substituent present on the ring,  their spatial relationship becomes important for which the [[arene substitution patterns]] ''ortho'', ''meta'', and ''para'' are devised. For example, three [[isomer]]s exist for [[cresol]] because the methyl group and the hydroxyl group can be placed next to each other (''ortho''), one position removed from each other (''meta''), or two positions removed from each other (''para''). [[Xylenol]] has two methyl groups in addition to the hydroxyl group, and, for this structure, 6 isomers exist.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The arene ring has an ability to stabilize charges. This is seen in, for example, phenol (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;–OH), which is [[acidic]] at the hydroxyl (OH), since a charge on this oxygen (alkoxide –O&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) is partially delocalized into the benzene ring.

{{main|Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon}}

[[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs) are aromatic hydrocarbons that consist of fused [[aromatic]] [[simple aromatic ring|rings]] and do not contain [[heteroatom]]s or carry [[substituent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Fetzer |first = J. C. |title = The Chemistry and Analysis of the Large Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons |year = 2000 |doi=10.1080/10406630701268255 |isbn = 0-471-36354-5|publisher = Wiley |location = New York |journal = Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds |volume = 27 |issue = 2 |pages = 143}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Naphthalene]] is the simplest example of a PAH.  PAHs occur in [[oil]], [[coal]], and [[tar]] deposits, and are produced as byproducts of fuel burning (whether fossil fuel or biomass). As pollutants, they are of concern because some compounds have been identified as [[carcinogen]]ic, [[mutagen]]ic, and [[teratogen]]ic. PAHs are also found in cooked foods. Studies have shown that high levels of PAHs are found, for example, in meat cooked at high temperatures such as grilling or barbecuing, and in smoked fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/out154_en.pdf |title=Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons – Occurrence in foods, dietary exposure and health effects |publisher=European Commission, Scientific Committee on Food|date=December 4, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Larsson |first=B.

They are also found in the [[interstellar medium]], in [[comet]]s, and in [[meteorite]]s and are a [[PAH world hypothesis|candidate molecule to act as a basis for the earliest forms of life]]. In [[graphene]] the PAH motif is extended to large 2D sheets.
