{{About|Alcmene in Greek mythology}}

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Alcmene''' {{IPAc-en|æ|l|k|ˈ|m|iː|n|iː}} or '''Alcmena''' {{IPAc-en|æ|l|k|ˈ|m|iː|n|ə}} ({{lang-grc|Ἀλκμήνη}} or Ἀλκμάνα [Doric]) was the wife of [[Amphitryon]] by whom she bore two children, [[Iphicles]] and [[Laonome]]. She is, however, better known as the mother of [[Heracles]] whose father was the god [[Zeus]].

== Mythology ==

===Background===
According to the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'', Alcmene was born to [[Electryon]], the son of [[Perseus (mythology)|Perseus]] and [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]], and king of [[Tiryns]] and [[Mycenae]] or Medea in [[Argolis (ancient region)|Argolis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D25%3Asection%3D9 2.25.9]&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother was [[Anaxo]], daughter of [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]] and [[Astydameia|Astydamia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollod. 2.4.5&quot;&gt;Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Library]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.4.5 2.4.5]&lt;/ref&gt; Other accounts say her mother was [[Lysidice (mythology)|Lysidice]], the daughter of [[Pelops]] and [[Hippodamia|Hippodameia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Plut. Thes. 7.1&quot;&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''[[Parallel Lives|Lives]]'' Theseus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plut.+Thes.+7.1 7.1]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Eurydice of Mycenae|Eurydice]] the daughter of [[Pelops]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Library of History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html 4.9].&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], the poet [[Asius of Samos|Asius]] made Alcmene the daughter of [[Amphiaraus]] and [[Eriphyle]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+5.17.8 5.17.8].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hesiod]] describes Alcmene as the tallest, most beautiful woman with wisdom surpassed by no person born of mortal parents. It is said that her face and dark eyes were as charming as [[Aphrodite]]'s, and that she honoured her husband like no woman before her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hes. Sh. 1&quot;&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Shield of Heracles]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Sh.+1 1ff.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exile to Thebes===
According to the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'', Alcmene went with [[Amphitryon]] to [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]], where he was purified by [[Creon]] for accidentally killing [[Electryon]]. Alcmene refused to marry Amphitryon until he had avenged the death of her brothers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollod. 2.4.6&quot;&gt;Apollodorus, ''Library'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.4.6 2.4.6]&lt;/ref&gt; During Amphitryon's expedition against the [[Taphians]] and [[Teleboans]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollod. 2.4.7&quot;&gt;Apollodorus, ''Library'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.4.7 2.4.7]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zeus]] visited Alcmene disguised as Amphitryon. Extending one night into three, Zeus slept with Alcmene, his great-granddaughter, thereby conceiving [[Heracles]], while recounting Amphitryon's victories against the Teleboans. When Amphitryon finally returned to Thebes, Alcmene told him that he had come the night before and slept with her; he learned from [[Tiresias]] what Zeus had done.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollod. 2.4.8&quot;&gt;Apollodorus, ''Library'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.4.8 2.4.8]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birth of Heracles===

====Homer====
In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', when Alcmene was about to give birth to Heracles, Zeus announced to all the gods that on that day a child by Zeus himself, would be born and  rule all those around him. [[Hera]], after requesting Zeus to swear an oath to that effect, descended from [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] to [[Argos]] and made the wife of [[Sthenelus (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Sthenelus]] (son of Perseus) give birth to [[Eurystheus]] after only seven months, while at the same time preventing Alcmene from delivering Heracles. This resulted in the fulfilment of Zeus's oath in that it was Eurystheus rather than Heracles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hom. Il. 19.95&quot;&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Il.+19.95 19.95ff.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ovid====
According to [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', while in labour, Alcmene was having great difficulty giving birth to such a large child. After seven days and nights of agony, Alcmene stretched out her arms and called upon [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]], the [[List of Roman birth and childhood deities|goddess of childbirth]] (the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] equivalent of [[Eileithyia]]). While Lucina did go to Alcmene, she had been previously instructed by [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] (Hera) to prevent the delivery. With her hands clasped and legs crossed, Lucina muttered charms, thereby preventing Alcmene from giving birth. Alcmene writhed in pain, cursed the heavens, and came close to death. [[Galanthis]], a maid of Alcmene who was nearby, observed Lucina's behaviour and quickly deduced that it was Juno's doing. To put an end to her mistress's suffering, she announced that Alcmene had safely delivered her child, which surprised Lucina so much that she immediately jumped up and unclenched her hands. As soon as Lucina leapt up, Alcmene was released from her spell, and gave birth to Heracles. As punishment for deceiving Lucina, Galanthis was transformed into a [[weasel]]; she continued to live with Alcmene.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ov. Met. 9.273&quot;&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]''  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Ov.+Met.+9.273 9.273ff.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pausanias====
In [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias']] recounting, Hera sent witches (as they were called by the Thebans) to hinder Alcmene's delivery of Heracles. The witches were successful in preventing the birth until [[Galanthis|Historis]], daughter of Tiresias, thought of a trick to deceive the witches. Like Galanthis, Historis announced that Alcmene had delivered her child; having been deceived, the witches went away, allowing Alcmene to give birth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paus. 9.11.3&quot;&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+9.11.3 9.11.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plautus====
In contrast to the depictions of a difficult labor above, an alternative version is presented in ''[[Amphitryon (Plautus play)|Amphitryon]]'', a comedic play by [[Plautus]]. Here Alcmene calls upon Jupiter, who performs a miracle allowing her to give birth quickly and without pain. After a crash of thunder and light, the baby arrives without anyone's assistance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plautus]], ''Amphitryon'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0092 &quot;The Subject&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
After the death of Amphitryon, Alcmene married [[Rhadamanthus|Rhadamanthys]], son of Zeus, and lived with him in exile at [[Ocalea (town)|Ocaleae]] in [[Boeotia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollod. 2.4.11&quot;&gt;Apollodorus, ''Library'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.4.11 2.4.11]&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that after Heracles was [[apotheosis]]ed, Hyllus, having pursued and killed [[Eurystheus]], cut off Eurystheus' head and gave it to Alcmene, who gouged out the eyes with weaving pins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollod. 2.8.1&quot;&gt;Apollodorus, ''Library'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.8.1 2.8.1]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Metamorphoses]], an aging Alcmene recounted the story of the birth of Heracles to [[Iole]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ov. Met. 9.273&quot; /&gt;

There are two accounts of Alcmene's death. In the first, according to the Megarians, Alcmene was walking from Argos to Thebes when she died at [[Megara]]. The [[Heracleidae]] fell into disagreement about where to take Alcmene's body, with some wishing to take her corpse back to Argos, and others wishing to take it to Thebes to be buried with Amphitryon and Heracles' children by [[Megara (mythology)|Megara]]. However, the god in [[Delphi]] gave the Heracleidae an oracle that it was better to bury Alcmene in Megara.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paus. 1.41.1&quot;&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+1.41.1 1.41.1]&lt;/ref&gt; In the second account given by the Thebans, when Alcmene died, she was turned from human form to a stone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paus. 9.16.7&quot;&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+9.16.7 9.16.7]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pausanias indicated that an altar to Alcmene had been built in the [[Cynosarges]] in Athens, alongside altars to Heracles, [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]], and [[Iolaus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Paus. 1.19.3&quot;&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+1.19.3 1.19.3]&lt;/ref&gt; Pausanias also said that Alcmene's tomb is located near the Olympieum at Megara.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paus. 1.41.1&quot; /&gt;
