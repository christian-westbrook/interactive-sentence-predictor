'''Americium''' is a [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Am''' and [[atomic number]] 95. It is a [[transuranic element|transuranic]] member of the [[actinide]] series, in the [[periodic table]] located under the [[lanthanide]] element [[europium]], and thus by analogy was named after the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The Transuranium Elements|first = Glenn T.|last = Seaborg|journal = Science|volume = 104|issue = 2704|date = 1946|pages = 379–386|doi = 10.1126/science.104.2704.379|pmid = 17842184|jstor = 1675046|bibcode = 1946Sci...104..379S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Americium was first produced in 1944 by the group of [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] from Berkeley, California, at the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] of the [[University of Chicago]], a part of the [[Manhattan Project]]. Although it is the third element in the [[transuranic element|transuranic series]], it was discovered fourth, after the heavier [[curium]]. The discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in November 1945. Most americium is produced by [[uranium]] or [[plutonium]] being bombarded with [[neutron]]s in [[nuclear reactor]]s – one [[tonne]] of spent [[nuclear fuel]] contains about 100&amp;nbsp;grams of americium. It is widely used in commercial [[ionization chamber]] [[smoke detectors]], as well as in [[neutron source]]s and industrial gauges. Several unusual applications, such as nuclear batteries or fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion, have been proposed for the [[isotope]] &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am, but they are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this [[nuclear isomer]].

Americium is a relatively soft [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] metal with silvery appearance. Its  [[Isotopes of americium|common isotopes]] are &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am. In chemical compounds, americium usually assumes the [[oxidation state]] +3, especially in solutions. Several other oxidation states are known, which range from +2 to +8 and can be identified by their characteristic [[optical absorption]] spectra. The crystal lattice of solid americium and its compounds contain small instrinsic radiogenic defects, due to [[Metamictization|metamictization]] induced by self-irradiation with alpha particles, which accumulates with time; this can cause a drift of some material properties over time, more noticeable in older samples.

==History==
[[File:Berkeley 60-inch cyclotron.gif|thumb|left|The 60-inch cyclotron at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, in August 1939.]]
[[File:Americium.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The triangle in the glass tube contains the first sample of americium (as the hydroxide (Am(OH)&lt;sub id=&quot;cite_ref-3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)), produced in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www2.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Research-Review/Magazine/1981/81fchp4.html |title=Demobilized Physics|journal=LBL NEWS Magazine|volume=6|issue=3|date= Fall 1981|page= 49}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Although americium was likely produced in previous nuclear experiments, it was [[discoveries of the chemical elements|first intentionally synthesized]], isolated and identified in late autumn 1944, at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], by [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], Leon O. Morgan, Ralph A. James, and [[Albert Ghiorso]]. They used a 60-inch [[cyclotron]] at the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utexas.edu/faculty/council/2002-2003/memorials/Morgan/morgan.html Obituary of Dr. Leon Owen (Tom) Morgan (1919–2002)], Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The element was chemically identified at the Metallurgical Laboratory (now [[Argonne National Laboratory]]) of the [[University of Chicago]]. Following the lighter [[neptunium]], [[plutonium]], and heavier [[curium]], americium was the fourth transuranium element to be discovered. At the time, the [[periodic table]] had been restructured by Seaborg to its present layout, containing the actinide row below the [[lanthanide]] one. This led to americium being located right below its twin lanthanide element europium; it was thus by analogy named after the [[Americas]]: &quot;The name americium (after the Americas) and the symbol Am are suggested for the element on the basis of its position as the sixth member of the actinide rare-earth series, analogous to europium, Eu, of the lanthanide series.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Seaborg, G.

The new element was isolated from its [[oxide]]s in a complex, multi-step process. First [[plutonium]]-239 nitrate (&lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;PuNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) solution was coated on a [[platinum]] foil of about 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area, the solution was evaporated and the residue was converted into plutonium dioxide (PuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by annealing. After cyclotron irradiation, the coating was dissolved with [[nitric acid]], and then precipitated as the hydroxide using concentrated aqueous [[ammonium hydroxide|ammonia solution]]. The residue was dissolved in [[perchloric acid]]. Further separation was carried out by [[ion exchange]], yielding a certain isotope of curium. The separation of curium and americium was so painstaking that those elements were initially called by the Berkeley group as ''[[wikt:pandemonium|pandemonium]]'' (from Greek for ''all demons'' or ''hell'') and ''[[wikt:delirium|delirium]]'' (from Latin for ''madness'').&lt;ref name=radio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Robert E.

Initial experiments yielded four americium isotopes: &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am, &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am, &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Am. [[Americium-241]] was directly obtained from plutonium upon absorption of one neutron. It decays by emission of a [[alpha particle|α-particle]] to &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np; the [[half-life]] of this decay was first determined as 510 ± 20 years but then corrected to 432.2 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;nubase&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Audi |first1=G. |doi=10.1016/S0375-9474(97)00482-X |title=The N? evaluation of nuclear and decay properties |date=1997 |page=1 |volume=624 |journal=Nuclear Physics A |url=http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923135135/http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-09-23 |bibcode=1997NuPhA.624....1A |last2=Bersillon |first2=O. |last3=Blachot |first3=J. |last4=Wapstra |first4=A.

The second isotope &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am was produced upon neutron bombardment of the already-created &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am. Upon rapid [[Beta-decay|β-decay]], &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am converts into the isotope of curium &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm (which had been discovered previously). The half-life of this decay was initially determined at 17 hours, which was close to the presently accepted value of 16.02 h.&lt;ref name=&quot;nubase&quot;/&gt;

The discovery of americium and curium in 1944 was closely related to the [[Manhattan Project]]; the results were confidential and declassified only in 1945. Seaborg leaked the synthesis of the elements 95 and 96 on the U.S. radio show for children ''[[Quiz Kids]]'' five days before the official presentation at an [[American Chemical Society]] meeting on 11 November 1945, when one of the listeners asked whether any new transuranium element beside plutonium and neptunium had been discovered during the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;radio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/americium.html|title = Chemical &amp; Engineering News: It's Elemental: The Periodic Table – Americium|accessdate =7 July 2010| first = Rachel Sheremeta|last = Pepling|date = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the discovery of americium isotopes &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am, their production and compounds were patented listing only Seaborg as the inventor.&lt;ref&gt;Seaborg, Glenn T. {{US patent|3156523}} &quot;Element&quot;, Filing date: 23 August 1946, Issue date: 10 November 1964&lt;/ref&gt; The initial americium samples weighed a few micrograms; they were barely visible and were identified by their radioactivity.

[[File:Ivy Mike - mushroom cloud.jpg|thumb|Americium was detected in the fallout from the ''[[Ivy Mike]]'' nuclear test.]]
The longest-lived and most common isotopes of americium, &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am, have half-lives of 432.2 and 7,370 years, respectively. Therefore, any [[Primordial nuclide|primordial]] americium (americium that was present on Earth during its formation) should have decayed by now.

Existing americium is concentrated in the areas used for the atmospheric [[nuclear weapons testing|nuclear weapons tests]] conducted between 1945 and 1980, as well as at the sites of nuclear incidents, such as the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. For example, the analysis of the debris at the testing site of the first U.S. [[hydrogen bomb]], [[Ivy Mike]], (1 November 1952, [[Enewetak Atoll]]), revealed high concentrations of various actinides including americium;  but due to military secrecy, this result was not published until later, in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fields|first1=P.

Elevated levels of americium were also detected at the [[1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash|crash site]] of a US [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|Boeing B-52]] bomber aircraft, which carried four hydrogen bombs, in 1968 in [[Greenland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eriksson, Mats |title=On Weapons Plutonium in the Arctic Environment |publisher=[[Lund University]] |date=April 2002 |location=Risø National Laboratory, Roskilde, Denmark |accessdate=15 November 2008 |url=http://www.risoe.dk/rispubl/NUK/nukpdf/ris-r-1321.pdf |format=PDF |page=28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218233551/http://www.risoe.dk/rispubl/NUK/nukpdf/ris-r-1321.pdf |archivedate=18 December 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other regions, the average radioactivity of surface soil due to residual americium is only about 0.01&amp;nbsp;[[Curie|picocuries]]/g (0.37&amp;nbsp;[[Becquerel|mBq]]/g). Atmospheric americium compounds are poorly soluble in common solvents and mostly adhere to soil particles. Soil analysis revealed about 1,900 times higher concentration of americium inside sandy soil particles than in the water present in the soil pores; an even higher ratio was measured in [[loam]] soils.&lt;ref name=&quot;am&quot;&gt;[http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/americium.pdf Human Health Fact Sheet on Americium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716164652/http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/americium.pdf |date=16 July 2011 }}, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Americium is produced mostly artificially in small quantities, for research purposes. A tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 100&amp;nbsp;grams of various americium isotopes, mostly &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, Klaus ''Kann man Gold machen?

The associated procedure may involve several steps, where americium is first separated and then converted by neutron bombardment in special reactors to short-lived nuclides. This procedure is well known as [[nuclear transmutation]], but it is still being developed for americium.&lt;ref&gt;Baetslé, L.

Americium has been produced in small quantities in [[nuclear reactor]]s for decades, and kilograms of its &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am isotopes have been accumulated by now.&lt;ref name=&quot;g1262&quot;&gt;Greenwood, p. 1262&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, since it was first offered for sale in 1962, its price, about 1,500 [[United States dollar|USD]] per gram of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am, remains almost unchanged owing to the very complex separation procedure.&lt;ref name=&quot;smoke&quot;&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf57.html Smoke detectors and americium], World Nuclear Association, January 2009, Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The heavier isotope &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am is produced in much smaller amounts; it is thus more difficult to separate, resulting in a higher cost of the order 100,000–160,000 USD/g.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRC&quot;&gt;Hammond C. R. &quot;The elements&quot; in {{RubberBible86th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Emeleus, H. J. |author2= Sharpe, A. G. | title = Advances in Inorganic Chemistry | url = https://books.google.com/?id=K5_LSQqeZ_IC&amp;pg=PA2| date = 1987| publisher = Academic Press| isbn = 978-0-08-057880-4| page = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Americium is not synthesized directly from uranium – the most common reactor material – but from the plutonium isotope &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu. The latter needs to be produced first, according to the following nuclear process:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{238}_{\ 92}U\ \xrightarrow {(n,\gamma)} \ ^{239}_{\ 92}U\ \xrightarrow [23.5 \ min]{\beta^-} \ ^{239}_{\ 93}Np\ \xrightarrow [2.3565 \ d]{\beta^-} \ ^{239}_{\ 94}Pu}&lt;/math&gt;

The capture of two neutrons by &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu (a so-called (n,γ) reaction), followed by a β-decay, results in &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{239}_{\ 94}Pu\ \xrightarrow {2(n,\gamma)} \ ^{241}_{\ 94}Pu\ \xrightarrow [14.35 \ yr]{\beta^-} \ ^{241}_{\ 95}Am}&lt;/math&gt;

The plutonium present in spent nuclear fuel contains about 12% of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Pu. Because it spontaneously converts to &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am, &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Pu can be extracted and may be used to generate further &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am.&lt;ref name=&quot;smoke&quot;/&gt; However, this process is rather slow: half of the original amount of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Pu decays to &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am after about 15 years, and the &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am amount reaches a maximum after 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bredl.org/sapc/Pu_ReportI.htm BREDL Southern Anti-Plutonium Campaign], Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League, Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The obtained &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am can be used for generating heavier americium isotopes by further neutron capture inside a nuclear reactor. In a [[light water reactor]] (LWR), 79% of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am converts to &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am and 10% to its [[nuclear isomer]] &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am:&lt;ref group=note&gt;The &quot;metastable&quot; state is marked by the letter m.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3327/jnst.41.448 |author=Sasahara, A. |title=Neutron and Gamma Ray Source Evaluation of LWR High Burn-up UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and MOX Spent Fuels |journal=Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology |date=2004 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=448–456 |url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jnst/41/4/448/_pdf |display-authors=etal |doi-access=free |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20101119071142/http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jnst/41/4/448/_pdf |archivedate=19 November 2010 }} [http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/ article/200410/000020041004A0333355.php Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Americium-242]] has a half-life of only 16 hours, which makes its further up-conversion to &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am, extremely inefficient. The latter isotope is produced instead in a process where &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu captures four neutrons under high [[neutron flux]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{239}_{\ 94}Pu\ \xrightarrow {4(n,\gamma)} \ ^{243}_{\ 94}Pu\ \xrightarrow [4.956 \ h]{\beta^-} \ ^{243}_{\ 95}Am}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Metal generation ===
Most synthesis routines yield a mixture of different actinide isotopes in oxide forms, from which isotopes of americium can be separated. In a typical procedure, the spent reactor fuel (e.g. [[MOX fuel]]) is dissolved in [[nitric acid]], and the bulk of uranium and plutonium is removed using a [[PUREX]]-type extraction ('''P'''lutonium–'''UR'''anium '''EX'''traction) with [[tributyl phosphate]] in a [[hydrocarbon]]. The lanthanides and remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue ([[raffinate]]) by a [[diamide]]-based extraction, to give, after stripping, a mixture of trivalent actinides and lanthanides. Americium compounds are then selectively extracted using multi-step [[chromatography|chromatographic]] and centrifugation techniques&lt;ref&gt;Penneman, pp. 34–48&lt;/ref&gt; with an appropriate reagent.

Metallic americium is obtained by [[Redox|reduction]] from its compounds. [[Americium(III) fluoride]] was first used for this purpose.

[[File:Closest packing ABAC.png|thumb|Double-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC in the crystal structure of α-americium (A: green, B: blue, C: red).]]

In the [[periodic table]], americium is located to the right of plutonium, to the left of curium, and below the lanthanide [[europium]], with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Americium is a highly radioactive element. When freshly prepared, it has a silvery-white metallic lustre, but then slowly tarnishes in air. With a density of 12&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, americium is less dense than both curium (13.52&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and plutonium (19.8&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;); but has a higher density than europium (5.264&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)—mostly because of its higher atomic mass. Americium is relatively soft and easily deformable and has a significantly lower [[bulk modulus]] than the actinides before it: Th, Pa, U, Np and Pu.&lt;ref name=pressure/&gt; Its melting point of 1173&amp;nbsp;°C is significantly higher than that of plutonium (639&amp;nbsp;°C) and europium (826&amp;nbsp;°C), but lower than for curium (1340&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name=&quot;AM_METALL2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wade|first1=W.|title=Preparation and some properties of americium metal|journal=Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry|volume=29|page=2577|date=1967|doi=10.1016/0022-1902(67)80183-0|issue=10|last2=Wolf|first2=T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AM_METALL2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AM_METALL4&quot;/&gt;

At ambient conditions, americium is present in its most stable α form which has a [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal crystal symmetry]], and a [[space group]] P6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/mmc with lattice parameters ''a''&amp;nbsp;= 346.8&amp;nbsp;[[picometer|pm]] and ''c''&amp;nbsp;= 1124&amp;nbsp;pm, and four atoms per [[unit cell]]. The crystal consists of a double-[[Close-packing of spheres|hexagonal close packing]] with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum and several actinides such as α-curium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gmelin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;AM_METALL4&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McWhan|first1=D.

When compressed at room temperature to 5 GPa, α-Am transforms to the β modification, which has a [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic]] (''fcc'') symmetry, space group Fm{{overline|3}}m and lattice constant ''a''&amp;nbsp;= 489&amp;nbsp;pm. This ''fcc'' structure is equivalent to the closest packing with the sequence ABC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gmelin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;AM_METALL4&quot;/&gt; Upon further compression to 23 GPa, americium transforms to an [[Orthorhombic crystal system|orthorhombic]] γ-Am structure similar to that of α-uranium. There are no further transitions observed up to 52 GPa, except for an appearance of a monoclinic phase at pressures between 10 and 15 GPa.&lt;ref name=&quot;pressure&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benedict|first1=U.|title=Study of actinide metals and actinide compounds under high pressures|journal=Journal of the Less Common Metals|volume=100|page=153|date=1984|doi=10.1016/0022-5088(84)90061-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no consistency on the status of this phase in the literature, which also sometimes lists the α, β and γ phases as I, II and III. The β-γ transition is accompanied by a 6% decrease in the crystal volume; although theory also predicts a significant volume change for the α-β transition, it is not observed experimentally. The pressure of the α-β transition decreases with increasing temperature, and when α-americium is heated at ambient pressure, at 770&amp;nbsp;°C it changes into an ''fcc'' phase which is different from β-Am, and at 1075&amp;nbsp;°C it converts to a [[Cubic crystal system|body-centered cubic]] structure. The pressure-temperature phase diagram of americium is thus rather similar to those of lanthanum, [[praseodymium]] and [[neodymium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1= Young |first1= D. A. | title = Phase diagrams of the elements| url = https://books.google.com/?id=F2HVYh6wLBcC&amp;pg=PA226| date = 1991| publisher = University of California Press| isbn = 978-0-520-91148-2| page = 226 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many other actinides, self-damage of the crystal lattice due to alpha-particle irradiation is intrinsic to americium. It is especially noticeable at low temperatures, where the mobility of the produced [[Interstitial defect|lattice defects]] is relatively low, by broadening of [[X-ray diffraction]] peaks. This effect makes somewhat uncertain the temperature of americium and some of its properties, such as electrical [[resistivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benedict|first1=U.|last2=Dufour|first2=C.|title=Low temperature lattice expansion of americium dioxide|journal=Physica B+C|volume=102|page=303|date=1980|doi=10.1016/0378-4363(80)90178-3|bibcode = 1980PhyBC.102..303B }}&lt;/ref&gt; So for americium-241, the resistivity at 4.2 K increases with time from about 2&amp;nbsp;µOhm·cm to 10&amp;nbsp;µOhm·cm after 40 hours, and saturates at about 16&amp;nbsp;µOhm·cm after 140 hours. This effect is less pronounced at room temperature, due to annihilation of radiation defects; also heating to room temperature the sample which was kept for hours at low temperatures restores its resistivity. In fresh samples, the resistivity gradually increases with temperature from about 2 µOhm·cm at [[liquid helium]] to 69&amp;nbsp;µOhm·cm at room temperature; this behavior is similar to that of neptunium, uranium, thorium and [[protactinium]], but is different from plutonium and curium which show a rapid rise up to 60&amp;nbsp;K followed by saturation. The room temperature value for americium is lower than that of neptunium, plutonium and curium, but higher than for uranium, thorium and protactinium.&lt;ref name=res/&gt;

Americium is [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] in a wide temperature range, from that of [[liquid helium]], to room temperature and above. This behavior is markedly different from that of its neighbor curium which exhibits antiferromagnetic transition at 52&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kanellakopulos|first1=B.|title=The magnetic susceptibility of Americium and curium metal|journal=Solid State Communications|volume=17|page=713|date=1975|doi=10.1016/0038-1098(75)90392-0|issue=6|bibcode = 1975SSCom..17..713K|last2=Blaise|first2=A.|last3=Fournier|first3=J. M.|last4=Müller|first4=W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[thermal expansion]] coefficient of americium is slightly anisotropic and amounts to (7.5&amp;nbsp;± 0.2){{e|-6}}/°C along the shorter ''a'' axis and (6.2&amp;nbsp;± 0.4){{e|-6}}/°C for the longer ''c'' hexagonal axis.&lt;ref name = &quot;AM_METALL4&quot;/&gt; The [[Enthalpy change of solution|enthalpy of dissolution]] of americium metal in [[hydrochloric acid]] at standard conditions is −620.6&amp;nbsp;± 1.3&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, from which the [[Standard enthalpy change of formation (data table)|standard enthalpy change of formation]] (Δ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;''H''°) of aqueous Am&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is −621.2&amp;nbsp;± 2.0&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Americium readily reacts with oxygen and dissolves well in [[acid]]s. The most common [[oxidation state]] for americium is +3,&lt;ref name=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Penneman, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; in which americium compounds are rather stable against oxidation and reduction. In this sense, americium is chemically similar to most lanthanides. The trivalent americium forms insoluble [[fluoride]], [[oxalate]], [[iodate]], [[hydroxide]], [[phosphate]] and other salts.&lt;ref name=p4/&gt; Other oxidation states have been observed between +2 and +7, which is the widest range among the actinide elements. Their color in aqueous solutions varies as follows: Am&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (colorless to yellow-reddish), Am&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; (yellow-reddish), Am&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;{{chem|O|2|+}}; (yellow), Am&lt;sup&gt;VI&lt;/sup&gt;{{chem|O|2|2+}} (brown) and Am&lt;sup&gt;VII&lt;/sup&gt;{{chem|O|6|5-}} (dark green).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemie-master.de/FrameHandler.php?loc=http://www.chemie-master.de/pse/pse.php?modul=Am Americium], Das Periodensystem der Elemente für den Schulgebrauch (The periodic table of elements for schools) chemie-master.de (in German), Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;g1265&quot;&gt;Greenwood, p. 1265&lt;/ref&gt; All oxidation states have their characteristic optical absorption spectra, with a few sharp peaks in the visible and mid-infrared regions, and the position and intensity of these peaks can be converted into the concentrations of the corresponding oxidation states.&lt;ref&gt;Penneman, pp. 10–14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amoh4/&gt;&lt;ref name=carbonate/&gt; For example, Am(III) has two sharp peaks at 504 and 811&amp;nbsp;nm, Am(V) at 514 and 715&amp;nbsp;nm, and Am(VI) at 666 and 992&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=haxav/&gt;

Americium compounds with oxidation state +4 and higher are strong oxidizing agents, comparable in strength to the [[permanganate]] ion ({{chem|MnO|4|-}}) in acidic solutions.&lt;ref name = &quot;HOWI_1956&quot;&gt;Wiberg, p. 1956&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the Am&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are unstable in solutions and readily convert to Am&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, the +4 oxidation state occurs well in solids, such as [[americium dioxide]] (AmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[americium(IV) fluoride]] (AmF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

All [[pentavalent]] and [[hexavalent]] americium compounds are complex salts such as KAmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AmO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;AmO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, Ba&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AmO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, AmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The tetravalent americium(IV) fluoride (AmF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is obtained by reacting solid americium(III) fluoride with molecular [[fluorine]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;f4&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=New Compounds of Quadrivalent Americium, AmF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, KAmF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;|last1=Asprey|first1=L.

The resulting reddish solution had a characteristic optical absorption spectrum which is similar to that of AmF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; but differed from other oxidation states of americium. Heating the Am(IV) solution to 90&amp;nbsp;°C did not result in its disproportionation or reduction, however a slow reduction was observed to Am(III) and assigned to self-irradiation of americium by alpha particles.&lt;ref name=&quot;amoh4&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=FIRST OBSERVATION OF AQUEOUS TETRAVALENT AMERICIUM|last1=Asprey|first1=L.

==Isotopes==
{{See also|Isotopes of americium}}
About 19 [[isotope]]s and 8 [[nuclear isomer]]s are known for americium. There are two long-lived alpha-emitters, &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am with half-lives of 432.2 and 7,370&amp;nbsp;years, respectively, and the nuclear isomer &lt;sup&gt;242m1&lt;/sup&gt;Am has a long half-life of 141&amp;nbsp;years. The half-lives of other isotopes and isomers range from 0.64&amp;nbsp;microseconds for &lt;sup&gt;245m1&lt;/sup&gt;Am to 50.8&amp;nbsp;hours for &lt;sup&gt;240&lt;/sup&gt;Am. As with most other actinides, the isotopes of americium with odd number of neutrons have relatively high rate of nuclear fission and low critical mass.&lt;ref name = &quot;nubase&quot;/&gt;

[[Americium-241]] decays to &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np emitting alpha particles of 5 different energies, mostly at 5.486&amp;nbsp;MeV (85.2%) and 5.443&amp;nbsp;MeV (12.8%). Because many of the resulting states are metastable, they also emit [[gamma ray]]s with the discrete energies between 26.3 and 158.5&amp;nbsp;keV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://87.139.25.178:81/eng/theory.htm|title=α-decay of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am. Theory – A lecture course on radioactivity|author=Klinck, Christian |publisher=University of Technology Kaiserslautern|accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Americium-242]] is a short-lived isotope with a half-life of 16.02&amp;nbsp;h.&lt;ref name=&quot;nubase&quot;/&gt; It mostly (82.7%) converts by β-decay to &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm, but also by [[electron capture]] to &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Pu (17.3%). Both &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Pu transform via nearly the same decay chain through &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu down to &lt;sup&gt;234&lt;/sup&gt;U.

Nearly all (99.541%) of &lt;sup&gt;242m1&lt;/sup&gt;Am decays by [[internal conversion]] to &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am and the remaining 0.459% by α-decay to &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Np. The latter subsequently decays to &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu and then to &lt;sup&gt;234&lt;/sup&gt;U.&lt;ref name=&quot;nubase&quot;/&gt;

[[Americium-243]] transforms by α-emission into &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Np, which converts by β-decay to &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu, and the &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu changes into &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U by emitting an α-particle.

===Ionization-type smoke detector===
{{Main|Smoke detector#Ionization}}

Americium is the only synthetic element to have found its way into the household, where the most common type of [[smoke detector]] uses &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am in the form of americium dioxide as its source of [[ionizing radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.uic.com.au/nip35.htm |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020911070229/http%3A//www%2Euic%2Ecom%2Eau/nip35%2Ehtm |archivedate= 11 September 2002 |title=Smoke Detectors and Americium |work=Nuclear Issues Briefing Paper |volume=35 |date=May 2002 |accessdate=2015-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This isotope is preferred over &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;[[radium|Ra]] because it emits 5 times more alpha particles and relatively little harmful gamma radiation. Element collector [[Theodore Gray]] mentions in his book ''The Elements: A Visual Exploration of Every Known Atom in the Universe'':
{{quote|You might think that a synthetic radioactive element that follows plutonium (94)—and has a significantly shorter half-life—would be some kind of superbomb material, available only to scientists in secret laboratories. Perhaps a mad scientist is studying americium in a lair somewhere, but if you want some yourself you can simply walk into any neighborhood hardware store, supermarket, or Wal-Mart and buy some, no questions asked.

The reason is not that americium is fundamentally less dangerous than the elements around it. In fact, the commonly available isotope, &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am, is significantly ''more'' radioactive than weapons-grade plutonium, and at least as toxic. No, the difference is simply that there is a useful application for americium that requires only a very tiny amount, and for which a company was prepared to go through the effort required to carve out and get a regulatory exception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Elements: A Visual Exploration of Every Known Atom in the Universe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IOY-8hxTJVAC&amp;pg=PT220|date=3 April 2012|publisher=Hachette Books|isbn=978-1-57912-895-1|page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The amount of americium in a typical new smoke detector is 1&amp;nbsp;[[Curie|microcurie]] (37&amp;nbsp;[[becquerel|kBq]]) or 0.29 [[microgram]]. This amount declines slowly as the americium decays into [[neptunium]]-237, a different transuranic element with a much longer half-life (about 2.14 million years). With its half-life of 432.2 years, the americium in a smoke detector includes about 3% [[neptunium]] after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years. The radiation passes through an [[ionization chamber]], an air-filled space between two [[electrode]]s, and permits a small, constant [[Electric current|current]] between the electrodes. Any smoke that enters the chamber absorbs the alpha particles, which reduces the ionization and affects this current, triggering the alarm. Compared to the alternative optical smoke detector, the ionization smoke detector is cheaper and can detect particles which are too small to produce significant light scattering; however, it is more prone to [[Type I and type II errors|false alarms]].&lt;ref&gt;Residential Smoke Alarm Performance, Thomas Cleary.

As &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am has a roughly similar half-life to &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu (432.2 years vs. 87 years), it has been proposed as an active element of [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s, for example in spacecraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;RTG&quot;&gt;[http://fti.neep.wisc.edu/neep602/SPRING00/lecture5.pdf Basic elements of static RTGs], G.L. Kulcinski, NEEP 602 Course Notes (Spring 2000), Nuclear Power in Space, University of Wisconsin Fusion Technology Institute (see last page)&lt;/ref&gt; Although americium produces less heat and electricity – the power yield is 114.7&amp;nbsp;mW/g for &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and 6.31&amp;nbsp;mW/g for &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am&lt;ref name=res/&gt; (cf. 390&amp;nbsp;mW/g for &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu)&lt;ref name=&quot;RTG&quot;/&gt; – and its radiation poses more threat to humans owing to neutron emission, the [[European Space Agency]] is considering using americium for its space probes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1007/09rtg/ Space agencies tackle waning plutonium stockpiles], Spaceflight now, 9 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Another proposed space-related application of americium is a fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion. It relies on the very high rate of nuclear fission of &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am, which can be maintained even in a micrometer-thick foil. Small thickness avoids the problem of self-absorption of emitted radiation. This problem is pertinent to uranium or plutonium rods, in which only surface layers provide alpha-particles.&lt;ref name=&quot;rocket&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title = Extremely Efficient Nuclear Fuel Could Take Man To Mars In Just Two Weeks|publisher = [[ScienceDaily]]|date = 3 January 2001|url = http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/01/010103073253.htm|accessdate =22 November 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071017120211/http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/01/010103073253.htm| archivedate= 17 October 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title = An americium-fueled gas core nuclear rocket|booktitle = AIP Conf.

One more proposal which utilizes the high nuclear fission rate of &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am is a nuclear battery. Its design relies not on the energy of the emitted by americium alpha particles, but on their charge, that is the americium acts as the self-sustaining &quot;cathode&quot;. A single 3.2&amp;nbsp;kg &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am charge of such battery could provide about 140&amp;nbsp;kW of power over a period of 80 days.&lt;ref&gt;Genuth, Iddo [http://thefutureofthings.com/articles.php?itemId=26/64/ Americium Power Source], The Future of Things, 3 October 2006, Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Even with all the potential benefits, the current applications of &lt;sup&gt;242m&lt;/sup&gt;Am are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this particular [[nuclear isomer]].&lt;ref name=mprice/&gt;

===Neutron source===
The oxide of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am pressed with [[beryllium]] is an efficient [[neutron source]]. Here americium acts as the alpha source, and beryllium produces neutrons owing to its large cross-section for the (α,n) nuclear reaction:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{241\!\,}_{\ 95}Am\ \longrightarrow \ ^{237}_{\ 93}Np\ +\ ^{4}_{2}He\ +\ \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{9}_{4}Be\ +\ ^{4}_{2}He\ \longrightarrow \ ^{12}_{\ 6}C\ +\ ^{1}_{0}n\ +\ \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

The most widespread use of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;AmBe neutron sources is a [[neutron probe]] – a device used to measure the quantity of water present in soil, as well as moisture/density for quality control in highway construction. &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am neutron sources are also used in well logging applications, as well as in [[neutron radiography]], tomography and other radiochemical investigations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Binder&quot;/&gt;

===Production of other elements===
Americium is a starting material for the production of other transuranic elements and [[transactinide]]s – for example, 82.7% of &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am decays to &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and 17.3% to &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Pu. In the nuclear reactor, &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Am is also up-converted by neutron capture to &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Am, which transforms by β-decay to &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{243}_{\ 95}Am\ \xrightarrow {(n,\gamma)} \ ^{244}_{\ 95}Am\ \xrightarrow [10.1 \ h]{\beta^-} \ ^{244}_{\ 96}Cm}&lt;/math&gt;

Irradiation of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am by &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C or &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Ne ions yields the isotopes &lt;sup&gt;247&lt;/sup&gt;Es ([[einsteinium]]) or &lt;sup&gt;260&lt;/sup&gt;Db ([[dubnium]]), respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Binder&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author = Binder, Harry H. | title = Lexikon der chemischen Elemente: das Periodensystem in Fakten, Zahlen und Daten : mit 96 Abbildungen und vielen tabellarischen Zusammenstellungen| date = 1999| isbn = 978-3-7776-0736-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the element [[berkelium]] (&lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Bk isotope) had been first intentionally produced and identified by bombarding &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am with alpha particles, in 1949, by the same Berkeley group, using the same 60-inch cyclotron. Similarly, [[nobelium]] was produced at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]], [[Dubna]], Russia, in 1965 in several reactions, one of which included irradiation of &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am with &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N ions. Besides, one of the synthesis reactions for [[lawrencium]], discovered by scientists at Berkeley and Dubna, included bombardment of &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am with &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O.&lt;ref name=g1252/&gt;

===Spectrometer===
Americium-241 has been used as a portable source of both gamma rays and alpha particles for a number of medical and industrial uses. The 59.5409&amp;nbsp;keV gamma ray emissions from &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am in such sources can be used for indirect analysis of materials in [[radiography]] and [[X-ray fluorescence]] spectroscopy, as well as for quality control in fixed [[nuclear density gauge]]s and [[nuclear densometer]]s. For example, the element has been employed to gauge [[glass]] thickness to help create flat glass.&lt;ref name=g1262/&gt; Americium-241 is also suitable for calibration of gamma-ray spectrometers in the low-energy range, since its spectrum consists of nearly a single peak and negligible Compton continuum (at least three orders of magnitude lower intensity).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/nudat2/indx_dec.jsp Nuclear Data Viewer 2.4], NNDC&lt;/ref&gt; Americium-241 gamma rays were also used to provide passive diagnosis of thyroid function. This medical application is however obsolete.

==Health concerns==
As a highly radioactive element, americium and its compounds must be handled only in an appropriate laboratory under special arrangements. Although most americium isotopes predominantly emit alpha particles which can be blocked by thin layers of common materials, many of the daughter products emit gamma-rays and neutrons which have a long penetration depth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=809&amp;tid=158 Public Health Statement for Americium] Section 1.5., Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, April 2004, Retrieved 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

If consumed, most of the americium is excreted within a few days, with only 0.05% absorbed in the blood, of which roughly 45%  goes to the [[liver]] and 45% to the bones, and the remaining 10% is excreted. The uptake to the liver depends on the individual and increases with age. In the bones, americium is first deposited over [[Cortex (anatomy)|cortical]] and [[trabecula]]r surfaces and slowly redistributes over the bone with time. The biological half-life of &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am is 50 years in the bones and 20 years in the liver, whereas in the [[gonad]]s (testicles and ovaries) it remains permanently; in all these organs, americium promotes formation of cancer cells as a result of its radioactivity.&lt;ref name=am/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doh.wa.gov/ehp/rp/factsheets/factsheets-pdf/fs23am241.pdf|author=Division of Environmental Health, Office of Radiation Protection|title=Fact Sheet # 23.

Americium often enters landfills from discarded [[smoke detector]]s. The rules associated with the disposal of smoke detectors are relaxed in most jurisdictions. In 1994, 17-year-old [[David Hahn]] extracted the americium from about 100 smoke detectors in an attempt to build a breeder nuclear reactor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Silverstein2005&quot;&gt;[[Ken Silverstein]], [http://www.harpers.org/archive/1998/11/0059750 The Radioactive Boy Scout: When a teenager attempts to build a breeder reactor].
