'''Agate''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|ɡ|ə|t}} is a [[cryptocrystalline]] variety of [[silica]], chiefly [[chalcedony]], characterised by its fineness of grain and brightness of color. Although agates may be found in various kinds of rock, they are classically associated with [[volcanic]] rocks and can be common in certain [[metamorphic rocks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wilder&quot;&gt;{{cite book

==Etymology and history==
The stone was given its name by [[Theophrastus]], a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[philosopher]] and [[naturalist]], who discovered the stone along the shore line of the river [[Dirillo|Achates]] ({{lang-el|Ἀχάτης}}) in present-day [[Sicily]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Ancient use===
Agate is one of the most common materials used in the art of [[hardstone carving]], and has been recovered at a number of ancient sites, indicating its widespread use in the ancient world; for example, archaeological recovery at the [[Knossos]] site on [[Crete]] illustrates its role in [[Bronze Age]] [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2007. [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10854/knossos.html#fieldnotes ''Knossos fieldnotes'', Modern Antiquarian]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation and characteristics==
[[File:Agatebots.jpg|thumb|left|Botswana agate]]
Most agates occur as [[Nodule (geology)|nodules]] in [[volcanic]] rocks or ancient [[lava]]s, in former cavities produced by [[Volatiles#Igneous petrology|volatiles]] in the original molten mass, which were then filled, wholly or partially, by siliceous matter deposited in regular layers upon the walls. Agate has also been known to fill veins or cracks in volcanic or altered rock underlain by granitic intrusive masses. Such agates, when cut [[transverse plane|transversely]], exhibit a succession of [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines, often of extreme [[wikt:tenuity|tenuity]], giving a banded appearance to the section. Such stones are known as ''banded agate'', ''riband agate'' and ''striped agate''.

In the formation of an ordinary agate, it is probable that waters containing [[silica]] in solution—derived, perhaps, from the decomposition of some of the silicates in the lava itself—percolated through the rock and deposited a siliceous gel in the interior of the [[Vesicular texture|vesicles]]. Variations in the character of the solution or in the conditions of deposition may cause a corresponding variation in the successive layers, so that bands of [[chalcedony]] often alternate with layers of crystalline [[quartz]]. Several vapour-vesicles may unite while the rock is still [[Viscosity|viscous]], and thus form a large cavity which may become the home of an agate of exceptional size; thus a [[Brazil]]ian [[geode]] lined with [[amethyst]] and weighing 35&amp;nbsp;tons was exhibited at the [[Düsseldorf Exhibition]] of 1902. Perhaps the most comprehensive review of agate chemistry is a recent text by Moxon cited below.

The first deposit on the wall of a cavity, forming the &quot;skin&quot; of the agate, is generally a dark greenish mineral substance, like [[celadonite]], [[delessite]] or &quot;[[green earth]]&quot;, which are rich in [[iron]] probably derived from the decomposition of the [[augite]] in the enclosing volcanic rock. This green silicate may give rise by alteration to a brown [[iron oxide]] ([[limonite]]), producing a rusty appearance on the outside of the agate-nodule. The outer [[Surface science|surface]] of an agate, freed from its matrix, is often pitted and rough, apparently in consequence of the removal of the original coating. The first layer spread over the wall of the cavity has been called the &quot;priming&quot;, and upon this base, [[Zeolite|zeolitic]] minerals may be deposited.

Many agates are hollow, since deposition has not proceeded far enough to fill the cavity, and in such cases the last deposit commonly consists of [[Druse (geology)|drusy quartz]], sometimes [[amethyst]]ine, having the [[Apex (geometry)|apices]] of the [[crystal]]s directed towards the free space so as to form a crystal-lined cavity or geode.

When the matrix in which the agates are embedded disintegrates, they are set free. The agates are extremely resistant to weathering and remain as nodules in the [[soil]], or are deposited as [[gravel]] in streams and along shorelines.

==Types of agate==

A Mexican agate, showing only a single eye, has received the name of ''cyclops agate.'' Included matter of a green, golden, red, black or other color or combinations embedded in the chalcedony and disposed in filaments and other forms suggestive of vegetable growth, gives rise to dendritic or [[moss agate]]. ''Dendritic'' agates have fern like patterns in them formed due to the presence of manganese and iron oxides. Other types of included matter deposited during agate-building include sagenitic growths (radial mineral crystals) and chunks of entrapped detritus (such as sand, ash, or mud). Occasionally agate fills a void left by decomposed vegetative material such as a tree limb or root and is called limb cast agate due to its appearance. [[Enhydro agate]] contains tiny inclusions of water, sometimes with air bubbles.

''Turritella agate'' is formed from silicified [[fossil]] ''[[Elimia tenera]]'' (erroneously considered ''[[Turritella]]'') shells. ''E. tenera'' are spiral freshwater [[gastropod]]s having elongated, spiral shells composed of many whorls. Similarly, [[coral]], [[petrified wood]] and other organic remains or porous rocks can also become agatized. Agatized coral is often referred to as [[Petoskey stone]] or agate.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

''Greek agate'' is a name given to pale white to tan colored agate found in [[Sicily]] back to 400 BC. The Greeks used it for making jewelry and beads. Even though the stone had been around centuries and was known to both the Sumerians and the Egyptians, both who used the gem for decoration and for playing important parts in their religious ceremonies, any agate of this color from Sicily, once an ancient Greek colony, is called Greek agate.

''Brazilian agate'' is found as sizable geodes of layered nodules. These occur in brownish tones interlayered with white and gray. Quartz forms within these nodules, creating a striking specimen when cut opposite the layered growth axis. It is often dyed in various colors for ornamental purposes.

Certain stones, when examined in [[thin section]]s by transmitted light, show a diffraction spectrum due to the extreme delicacy of the successive bands, whence they are termed ''rainbow agates''. Often agate coexists with layers or masses of opal, jasper or crystalline quartz due to ambient variations during the formation process.

''Lace agate'' is a variety that exhibits a [[lace]]-like pattern with forms such as eyes, swirls, bands or zigzags (if these predominate, it is called ''lattice agate''). ''Crazy lace agate'', found in Mexico, is often brightly colored and complexly patterned. ''Blue lace agate'' is found in Africa and is especially hard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polk 80&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Polk|first1=Patti|title=Collecting Rocks, Gems and Minerals: Identification, Values and Lapidary Uses|date=2016|publisher=F+W Media, Inc.|isbn=9781440246159|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Polyhedroid agate'' is agate which has grown in a flat-sided shape similar to a [[polyhedron]].&lt;ref&gt;Plodowski, G., and Werner, R.; Achate: Kleine Senckenberg-Reihe, No. 12 (1981), p. 34, fig. 20&lt;/ref&gt; When sliced, it often shows a characteristic layering of concentric [[polygon]]s. Polyhedroid agate is thought to be found only in [[Paraíba]] State, Brazil. It has been suggested that growth is not crystallographically controlled but is due to the filling-in of spaces between pre-existing crystals which have since dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donoghue, M.; ''Quartz'', Butterworth-Heinemann (1987), p. 82. {{ISBN|978-0408014625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of agate include Holley&lt;!-- Not &quot;Holly&quot;, the stone is named after the town of Holley --&gt; blue agate (also spelled &quot;Holly blue agate&quot;), a rare dark blue ribbon agate only found near [[Holley, Oregon]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1957/281/WRRI-5ocr.pdf?sequence=1|title= Socio-Cultural Impacts of Water Resource Development in the Santiam River Basin |date= October 1970 |publisher= Oregon State University: Water Resources Research Institute |page= 9 |accessdate= February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lake Superior agate]]; carnelian agate (has reddish hues); Botswana agate; plume agate; [[condor agate]], tube agate (with visible flow channels or pinhole-sized &quot;tubes&quot;); fortification agate (with contrasting concentric banding reminiscent of defensive ditches and walls around ancient forts); [[Binghamite]], a variety found only in [[Montana]]; [[fire agate]] (showing internal flash or &quot;fire&quot;, the result of a layer of clear agate over a layer of hydrothermally deposited hematite); and [[Patuxent River stone]], a red and yellow form of agate only found in [[Maryland]], where it is the state gem.

==Uses in industry and art==
Industrial uses of agate exploit its hardness, ability to retain a highly polished surface finish and resistance to chemical attack. It has traditionally been used to make knife-edge bearings for [[laboratory balance]]s and precision pendulums, and sometimes to make [[Mortar and pestle|mortars and pestles]] to crush and mix chemicals. It has also been used for centuries for [[leather burnishing]] tools.

The decorative arts use it to make ornaments such as [[pins]], [[brooch]]es or other types of [[jewellery]], paper knives, [[inkstand]]s, [[marbles]] and [[seal (emblem)|seals]]. Agate is also still used today for decorative displays, cabochons, beads, carvings and [[Intarsia]] art as well as face-polished and tumble-polished specimens of varying size and origin. [[Idar-Oberstein]] was one of the centers which made use of agate on an industrial scale. Where in the beginning locally found agates were used to make all types of objects for the European market, this became a globalized business around the turn of the 20th century: Idar-Oberstein imported large quantities of agate from Brazil, as ship's ballast. Making use of a variety of proprietary chemical processes, they produced colored beads that were sold around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farlang.com/art/2007-04-15.7721093142 Background Article on Idar Oberstein]&lt;/ref&gt; Agates have long been used in arts and crafts. The sanctuary of a Presbyterian church in [[Yachats, Oregon]], has six windows with panes made of agates collected from the local beaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yachatspresbyterian.org/webapp/GetPage?pid=211|title=Agate Windows - Community Presbyterian Church|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
