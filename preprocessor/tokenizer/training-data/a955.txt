'''Ambroise''', sometimes '''Ambroise of Normandy''',&lt;ref&gt;This form appeared first in {{emc1|Marianne Ailes|Ambroise of Normandy|34-35}}&lt;/ref&gt; (flourished {{circa|1190}}) was a [[Normans|Norman]] poet and chronicler of the [[Third Crusade]], author of a work called ''{{lang|fro|L'Estoire de la guerre sainte}}'', which describes in rhyming [[Old French language|Old French]] verse the adventures of {{lang|fr|[[Richard I of England|Richard Cœur de Lion]]}} as a [[crusade]]r.  The poem is known to us only through one [[Vatican Library|Vatican]] [[manuscript]], and long escaped the notice of historians.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Ambrose (Poet)|display=Ambrose|volume=1|page=798|first=Henry William Carless|last=Davis|authorlink=Henry William Carless Davis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The credit for detecting its value belongs to [[Gaston Paris]], although his edition (1897) was partially anticipated by the editors of the ''{{lang|la|[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]}}'', who published some selections in the twenty-seventh volume of their Scriptores (1885). Ambroise followed Richard I as a [[noncombatant]], and not improbably as a court-[[minstrel]]. He speaks as an eye-witness of the king's doings at [[Messina, Italy|Messina]], in [[Cyprus]],  at the [[siege of Acre (1189–1191)|siege of Acre]], and in the abortive campaign which followed the capture of that city.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

Ambroise is surprisingly accurate in his [[chronology]]; though he did not complete his work before 1195, it is evidently founded upon notes which he had taken in the course of his [[pilgrimage]].  He shows no greater political insight than we should expect from his position; but relates what he had seen and heard with a naïve vivacity which compels attention. He is by no means an impartial source: he is prejudiced against the [[Saracens]], against the French, and against all the rivals or enemies of his master, including the ''Polein'' party which supported [[Conrad of Montferrat]] against [[Guy of Lusignan]]. He is rather to be treated as a [[biographer]] than as a historian of the Crusade in its broader aspects. Nonetheless he is an interesting primary source for the events of the years 1190–1192 in the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

Books 2–6 of the ''[[Itinerarium Regis Ricardi]]'', a Latin prose narrative of the same events apparently compiled by Richard, a canon of Holy Trinity, London, are closely related to Ambroise's poem. They were formerly sometimes regarded as the first-hand narrative on which Ambroise based his work, but that can no longer be maintained.{{sfn|Davis|1911}}
