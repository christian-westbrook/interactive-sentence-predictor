The '''Alabama River''', in the U.S. state of [[Alabama]], is formed by the [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] and [[Coosa River|Coosa]] rivers, which unite about {{convert|6|mi|0}} north of [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], near the suburb of [[Wetumpka, Alabama|Wetumpka]]&lt;ref name = eb&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/11995/Alabama-River&lt;/ref&gt;

The river flows west to [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]], then southwest until, about {{convert|45|mi}} from [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], it unites with the [[Tombigbee River|Tombigbee]], forming the [[Mobile River|Mobile]] and [[Tensaw River|Tensaw]] rivers, which discharge into [[Mobile Bay]].&lt;ref name = eb/&gt;

==Description==
The course of the Alabama is very meandering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caria.org/navigation.html&lt;/ref&gt; Its width varies from {{convert|50|to|200|yd}}, and its depth from {{convert|3|to|40|ft|0}}. Its length as measured by the [[United States Geological Survey]] is {{convert|318.5|mi}},&lt;ref name=NHD&gt;U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. [http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/ The National Map] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/66gupqQDM?url=http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/ |date=2012-04-05 }}, accessed April 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[steamboat]] measurement, {{convert|420|mi}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berney&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Berney |first=Saffold |title=Handbook Of Alabama: A Complete Index To The State |publisher=Nabu Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-1792-5964-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The river crosses the richest agricultural and timber districts of the state.  Railways connect it with the mineral regions of north-central Alabama.

After the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers, the principal tributary of the Alabama is the [[Cahaba River]], which is about {{convert|194|mi}} long&lt;ref name=NHD/&gt; and joins the Alabama River about {{convert|10|mi}} below Selma. The Alabama River's main tributary, the Coosa River, crosses the mineral region of Alabama and is navigable for light-draft boats from [[Rome, Georgia]], to about {{convert|117|mi}} above [[Wetumpka, Alabama|Wetumpka]] (about {{convert|102|mi}} below Rome and {{convert|26|mi}} below Greensport), and from Wetumpka to its junction with the Tallapoosa. The channel of the river has been considerably improved by the federal government.

The navigation of the Tallapoosa River – which has its source in [[Paulding County, Georgia]], and is about {{convert|265|mi}} long&lt;ref name=NHD/&gt; – is prevented by [[shoal]]s and a {{convert|60|ft|adj=on}} fall at [[Tallassee, Alabama|Tallassee]], a few miles north of its junction with the Coosa. The Alabama is navigable throughout the year.

The river played an important role in the growth of the economy in the region during the 19th century as a source of transportation of goods. The river is still used for transportation of farming produce; however, it is not as important as it once was due to the construction of roads and railways.

Discovered in 1712, the Alabama, Coosa, and Tallapoosa rivers were central to the homeland of the [[Creek people|Creek Indians]] before their [[Indian Removal|removal]] by United States forces to the [[Indian Territory]] in the 1830s.

==Edmund Pettus Bridge==
The [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] crosses the Alabama River near [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]].  The bridge was the site of a civil rights march in 1965.

==Lock and dams==
The Alabama River has three lock and dams between Montgomery and the Mobile River.  The Robert F. Henry Lock &amp; Dam is located at river mile 236.2, the Millers Ferry Lock &amp; Dam is located at river mile 133.0, and the Claiborne Lock &amp; Dam is located at river mile 72.5.&lt;ref&gt;Courtesy [http://www.sam.usace.army.mil/ U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Mobile District]
