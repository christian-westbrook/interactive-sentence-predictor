'''Albert the Bear''' ({{lang-de|Albrecht der Bär}}; {{lang-la|Adelbertus, Adalbertus, Albertus}}; {{c.}} 1100 – 18 November 1170) was the first [[Margrave of Brandenburg]] (as Albert&amp;nbsp;I) from 1157 to his death and was briefly [[Duke of Saxony]] between 1138 and&amp;nbsp;1142.

==Life==
Albert was the only son of [[Otto, Count of Ballenstedt]], and [[Eilika of Saxony|Eilika]], daughter of [[Magnus, Duke of Saxony|Magnus Billung]], [[Rulers of Saxony|Duke of Saxony]].  He inherited the valuable estates in northern Saxony of his father in 1123, and on his mother's death, in 1142, succeeded to one-half of the lands of the house of [[Billung]]. Albert was a loyal [[vassal]] of his relation, [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothar I, Duke of Saxony]], from whom, about 1123, he received the Margraviate of [[Lusatia]], to the east; after Lothar became [[King of the Germans]], he accompanied him on a disastrous expedition to [[Bohemia]] against the upstart, [[Soběslav I, Duke of Bohemia]] in 1126 at the [[Battle of Chlumec|Battle of Kulm]], where he suffered a short imprisonment.

Albert's entanglements in Saxony stemmed from his desire to expand his inherited estates there. After the death of his brother-in-law, [[Henry II, Margrave of the Nordmark]], who controlled a small area on the Elbe called the Saxon [[Northern March]], in 1128, Albert, disappointed at not receiving this fief himself, attacked [[Udo IV, Margrave of the Nordmark|Udo V, Count of Stade]], the heir, and was consequently deprived of Lusatia by Lothar. Udo, however, was said to have been assassinated by servants of Albert on 15 March 1130 near [[Aschersleben]]. In spite of this, he went to [[Italy]] in 1132 in the train of the king, and his services there were rewarded in 1134 by the investiture of the Northern March, which was again without a ruler.

In 1138 [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]], the Hohenstaufen King of the Germans, deprived Albert's cousin and nemesis, [[Henry X, Duke of Bavaria|Henry the Proud]] of his Saxon duchy, which was awarded to Albert if he could take it. After some initial success in his efforts to take possession, Albert was driven from Saxony, and also from his Northern march by a combined force of Henry and [[Jaxa of Köpenick]], and compelled to take refuge in south Germany. When peace was made with Henry in 1142, Albert renounced the Saxon duchy and received the counties of [[Weimar]] and [[Orlamünde]].  It was possibly at this time that Albert was made Archchamberlain of the Empire, an office which afterwards gave the Margraves of Brandenburg the rights of a [[prince-elector]].

Once he was firmly established in the Northern March, Albert's covetous eye lay also on the thinly populated lands to the north and east. For  three years he was occupied in campaigns against the Slavic [[Wends]], who as pagans were considered fair game, and whose subjugation to Christianity was the aim of the [[Wendish Crusade]] of 1147 in which Albert took part. Albert was a part of the army that besieged [[Demmin]]. And at the end of the war, recovered [[Havelberg]], which had been lost since 983. Diplomatic measures were more successful, and by an arrangement made with the last of the Wendish princes of Brandenburg, [[Pribislav of Brandenburg|Pribislav]] of the [[Hevelli]], Albert secured this district when the prince died in 1150. Taking the title &quot;Margrave in Brandenburg&quot;, he pressed the &quot;crusade&quot; against the Wends, extended the area of his mark, encouraged German migration, established bishoprics under his protection, and so became the founder of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] in 1157, which his heirs &amp;mdash; the [[House of Ascania]] &amp;mdash; held until the line died out in 1320.

In 1158 a feud with Henry's son, [[Henry the Lion]], Duke of Saxony, was interrupted by a pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]]. On his return in 1160, he, with the consent of his sons; Siegfried not being mentioned, donated land to the [[Knights of Saint John]] in memory of his wife, Sofia, at [[Werben (Elbe)|Werben]] at the [[Elbe]].&lt;ref&gt;Freller 2010, pp. 40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freller 2010, pp. 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyon 2013, pp. 35&lt;/ref&gt; In 1162 Albert accompanied Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] to [[Italy]], where he distinguished himself at the storming of [[Milan]].

In 1164 Albert joined a league of princes formed against Henry the Lion, and peace being made in 1169, Albert divided his territories among his six sons. He died on 13 November 1170, possibly in [[Stendal]], and was buried at [[Ballenstedt]].

==Cognomen==
[[Image:Bär 148-KA1.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Foundation of the memorial to Albert at [[Spandau Citadel]].]]
Albert's personal qualities won for him the [[cognomen]] of ''the [[Bear]],'' &quot;not from his looks or qualities, for he was a tall handsome man, but from the cognisance on his shield, an able man, had a quick eye as well as a strong hand, and could pick what way was straightest among crooked things, was the shining figure and the great man of the North in his day, got much in the North and kept it, got Brandenburg for one there, a conspicuous country ever since,&quot; says [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]], who called Albert &quot;a restless, much-managing, wide-warring man.&quot;  He is also called by later writers &quot;the Handsome.&quot;
