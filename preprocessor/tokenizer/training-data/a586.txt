'''Ambracia''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|m|ˈ|b|r|eɪ|ʃ|ə}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμβρακία}}, occasionally {{lang|grc|Ἀμπρακία}}, ''Ampracia''), was a city of ancient Greece on the site of modern [[Arta, Greece|Arta]]. It was founded as a [[Corinth, Greece|Corinthian]] [[colonies in antiquity|colony]] in the 7th century BC and was situated about 7 miles from the [[Ambracian Gulf]], on a bend of the navigable river [[Arachthos River|Arachthos]] (or Aratthus), in the midst of a fertile wooded plain.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;&gt;{{Citation  | last = Hammond  | first = Nicholas Geoffrey Lemprière  | author-link=N.

==History==
It was founded between 650 and 625 BC by [[Gorgus]], son of the Corinthian tyrant [[Cypselus]], at which time its economy was based on farmlands, fishing, timber for shipbuilding, and the exportation of the produce of Epirus.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;/&gt; After the expulsion of Gorgus's son Periander its government developed into a strong democracy.  The early policy of Ambracia was determined by its loyalty to Corinth (for which it probably served as an entrepot in the [[Epirus]] trade), and its consequent aversion to [[Corcyra]] (as Ambracia participated on the Corinthian side at the [[Battle of Sybota]], which took place in 433 BC between the rebellious Corinthian colony of Corcyra (modern Corfu) and [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]]).{{sfn|Caspari|1911}}

Ambraciot politics featured many frontier disputes with the [[Amphilochians]] and [[Acarnanians]].  Hence it took a prominent part in the [[Peloponnesian War]] until the crushing defeat at [[Idomene]] (426), which crippled its resources.{{sfn|Caspari|1911}}

In the 4th century BC it continued its traditional policy, but in 338 was besieged by [[Philip II of Macedon]]. With the assistance of Corinth and Athens, it escaped complete domination at Philip's hands, but was nevertheless forced to accept a Macedonian garrison.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;/&gt;  In 294 BC, after forty-three years of semi-autonomy under [[Macedon]]ian suzerainty, Ambracia was given by the son of [[Cassander]] to [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], king of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]], who made it his capital, and adorned it with palace, temples and theatres.  In the wars of [[Philip V of Macedon]] and the Epirotes against the [[Aetolian League]] (220–205) Ambracia passed from one alliance to the other, but ultimately joined the latter confederacy.  During the struggle of the Aetolians against [[Roman Republic|Rome]], it stood a stubborn [[siege]],{{sfn|Caspari|1911}} including the first known use of [[poison gas]] against the Romans' [[Tunnel warfare|siege tunnels]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Polybius]] 21.28&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambracia was captured and plundered by [[Marcus Fulvius Nobilior (consul 189 BC)|Marcus Fulvius Nobilior]] in 189 BC, after which it was declared by Rome a &quot;free city&quot;, and gradually fell into insignificance.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Caspari|1911}}  The foundation by [[Augustus Caesar|Augustus]] of [[Nicopolis]], into which the remaining inhabitants were drafted, left the site desolate.  In [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times a new settlement took its place under the name of [[Arta, Greece|Arta]]. Some fragmentary walls of large, well-dressed blocks near this latter town indicate the early prosperity of Ambracia.{{sfn|Caspari|1911}}
