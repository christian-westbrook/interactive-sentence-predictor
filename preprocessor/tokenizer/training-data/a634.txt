'''Acapulco de Juárez''' ({{IPA-es|akaˈpulko de ˈxwaɾes|lang}}), commonly called '''Acapulco''', is a city, [[municipalities of Mexico|municipality]] and major seaport in the [[Political divisions of Mexico|state]] of [[Guerrero]] on the Pacific coast of [[Mexico]], {{convert|380|km}} south of [[Mexico City]].  Acapulco is located on a deep, semicircular bay and has been a port since the early colonial period of Mexico's history.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/guerrero/municipios/12001a.htm |title=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Estado de Guerrero Acapulco de Juárez |publisher=INAFED |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=January 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033438/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/guerrero/municipios/12001a.htm |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a port of call for shipping and cruise lines running between [[Panama]] and [[San Francisco, California]], United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;apiacapulco&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apiacapulcoport.com/historia-de-api-acapulco/ |title=History of API Acapulco |publisher=Administracion Portuaria Integral |location=Acapulco, Guerrero |language=Spanish |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Acapulco is the largest in the state, far larger than the state capital [[Chilpancingo]].

The seal for the city shows broken reeds or cane.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt; The island and municipality of [[Capul]], in the Philippines, derives its name from Acapulco; Capul was the western end of the trans-Pacific sailing route from Acapulco to what was then a Spanish colony.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Acapulco}}

===Pre-Columbian===
[[File:Puerto de Acapulco Boot 1628.png|left|thumb|A 1628 relief atlas of [[Acapulco Bay]].]]
By the 8th century around the [[Acapulco Bay]] area, there was a small culture which would first be dominated by the [[Olmec]]s, then by a number of others during the pre-Hispanic period and before it ended in the 1520s. At Acapulco Bay itself, there were two Olmec sites, one by [[Playa Larga]] and the other on a hill known as El Guitarrón. Olmec influence caused the small spread-out villages here to coalesce into larger entities and build ceremonial centers.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt;

Later, [[Teotihuacan]] influence made its way here via [[Cuernavaca]] and Chilpancingo. Then [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] influence arrived from the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] and through what is now [[Oaxaca]]. This history is known through the archaeological artifacts that have been found here, especially at Playa Hornos, Pie de la Cuesta and Tambuco.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt;

In the 11th century, new waves of migration of [[Nahua peoples|Nahuas]] and Coixas came through here. These people were the antecedents of the [[Aztec]]s. In the later 15th century, after four years of military struggle, Acapulco became part of the [[Aztec empire]] during the reign of [[Ahuizotl]] (1486–1502). It was annexed to a tributary province named ''Tepecuacuilco''. However, this was only transitory, as the Aztecs could only establish an unorganized military post at the city's outskirts. The city was on territory under control of the Yopes, who continued defending it and living there until the arrival of the Spanish in the 1520s.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cabrera Guerrero, Martha Eugenia, 1990, '''Los pobladores prehispánicos de Acapulco''', INAH, {{ISBN|968-6487-44-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===16th century===
There are two stories about how Acapulco bay was discovered by Europeans. The first states that two years after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], [[Hernán Cortés]] sent explorers west to find gold. The explorers had subdued this area after 1523, and Captain Saavedra Cerón was authorized by Cortés to found a settlement here. The other states that the bay was discovered on December 13, 1526 by a small ship named the El Tepache Santiago captained by Santiago Guevara.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt;
The first [[encomendero]] was established in 1525 at Cacahuatepec, which is part of the modern Acapulco municipality. In 1531, a number of Spaniards, most notably [[Juan Rodriguez de Villafuerte]], left the Oaxaca coast and founded the village of Villafuerte where the city of Acapulco now stands. Villafuerte was unable to subdue the local native peoples, and this eventually resulted in the Yopa Rebellion in the region of Cuautepec. Hernán Cortés was obligated to send Vasco Porcayo to negotiate with the indigenous people giving concessions. The province of Acapulco became the encomendero of Rodriguez de Villafuerte who received taxes in the form of cocoa, cotton and corn.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt;

People sit by a hut with two longboats. A woman carries a basket on her head up the beach toward a tile-roof house. Lush forest is silhouetted against the late sunset. |''View of Acapulco'', 1879, oil painting by [[Carl Saltzmann]]]]Cortés established Acapulco as a major port by the early 1530s, with the first major road between Mexico City and the port constructed by 1531. The wharf, named Marqués, was constructed by 1533 between Bruja Point and Diamond Point. Soon after, the area was made an &quot;alcadia&quot; (major province or town).&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt;

Spanish trade in the Far East would give Acapulco a prominent position in the economy of [[New Spain]]. Galleons started arriving here from Asia by 1550, and in that year thirty Spanish families were sent to live here from Mexico City to have a permanent base of European residents.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt; Acapulco would become the second most important port, after [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]], due to its direct trade with the Philippines. This trade would focus on the yearly [[Manila-Acapulco Galleon]] trade, which was the nexus of all kinds of communications between New Spain, Europe and Asia. In 1573, the port was granted the monopoly of the Manila trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;apiacapulco&quot;/&gt;

===17th–19th centuries===
The [[Manila-Acapulco Galleon|galleon trade]] made its yearly run from the mid-16th century until the early 19th. The luxury items it brought to New Spain attracted the attention of English and Dutch [[pirates]], such as [[Francis Drake]], [[Henry Morgan]] and [[Thomas Cavendish]], who called it &quot;The Black Ship.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nileg&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mikerita&quot;/&gt; A Dutch fleet invaded Acapulco in 1615, destroying much of the town before being driven off. The [[Fort of San Diego]] was built the following year to protect the port and the cargo of arriving ships. The fort was destroyed by an earthquake in 1776 and was rebuilt between 1778 and 1783.&lt;ref name=&quot;nileg&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mikerita&quot;/&gt;
At the beginning of the 19th century, King Charles IV declared Acapulco a Ciudad Official and it became an essential part of the Spanish Crown. However, not long after, the [[Mexican War of Independence]] began. In 1810, [[José María Morelos y Pavón]] attacked and burnt down the city,&lt;ref name=&quot;nileg&quot;/&gt; after he defeated royalist commander Francisco Parés at the Battle of Tres Palos.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt; The independence of Mexico in 1821 ended the run of the Manila Galleon.&lt;ref name=&quot;mikerita&quot;/&gt;
Acapulco's importance as a port recovered during the [[California Gold Rush]] in the mid-19th-century, with ships going to and coming from Panama stopping here.&lt;ref name=&quot;nileg&quot;/&gt;  This city was the besieged on 19 April 1854 by [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] after Guerrero's leadership had rebelled by issuing the [[Plan of Ayutla|Plan de Ayutla]].  After an unsuccessful week of fighting, Santa Anna retreated.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, Will (2007). ''Santa Anna of Mexico''. Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press. p. 313. {{ISBN|9780803211209}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
In 1911, [[Mexican Revolution|revolutionary forces]] took over the main plaza of Acapulco.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt;
In 1920, the [[Prince of Wales]] (the future [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]]) visited the area. Impressed by what he saw, he recommended the place to his compatriots in Europe, making it popular with the elite there. Much of the original hotel and trading infrastructure was built by an East Texas businessman named Albert B. Pullen from Corrigan, Texas, in the area now known as Old Acapulco.&lt;ref name=&quot;nileg&quot;/&gt; In 1933 Carlos Barnard started the first section of Hotel El Mirador,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acapulcoenlinea.com.mx/content/view/2754/91/ Portal de Acapulco – Acapulco y su Arquitectura] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905050020/http://www.acapulcoenlinea.com.mx/content/view/2754/91/ |date=September 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with 12 rooms on the cliffs of [[La Quebrada, Mexico|La Quebrada]]. Wolf Schoenborn purchased large amounts of undeveloped land and Albert Pullen built the Las Americas Hotel.&lt;ref name=&quot;mikerita&quot;/&gt;

In the mid-1940s, the first commercial wharf and warehouses were built.&lt;ref name=&quot;apiacapulco&quot;/&gt; In the early 1950s, President [[Miguel Alemán Valdés]] upgraded the port's infrastructure, installing electrical lines, drainage systems, roads and the first highway to connect the port with Mexico City.&lt;ref name=&quot;nileg&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Acapulco - Palmasola-Punto-mas-alto.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|The Bay of Acapulco from the top of Palma Sola]]
The economy grew and foreign investment increased with it. During the 1950s, Acapulco became the fashionable place for millionaire Hollywood stars such as [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nileg&quot;/&gt; Former Swing Musician [[Teddy Stauffer]], so called &quot;Mister Acapulco&quot;, was a hotel manager (&quot;Villa Vera&quot;, &quot;Casablanca&quot;), who attracted a lot of celebrities to Acapulco.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stockpress.de/2010/08/05/teddy-stauffer-der-swingkonig-im-paradies/ Teddy Stauffer: Der Swingkönig im Paradies – STOCKPRESS.de &amp;#124; STOCKPRESS.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Acapulco Beach.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=High view of the beachfront condos and hotels on the left, the long curved beach, Pacific Ocean on the right|Beach at Acapulco]]

From a population of only 4,000 or 5,000 in the 1940s,&lt;ref name=&quot;mikerita&quot;/&gt; by the early 1960s, Acapulco had a population of about 50,000.&lt;ref&gt;''World Book Encyclopedia'', 1967 Edition, Vol. 1, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, the Diocese of Acapulco was created by [[Pope Pius XII]]. It became an archdiocese in 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;arquid&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arquidiocesisacapulco.org/ |title= Historia de la Arquidiócesis |publisher=Archdiocese of Acapulco |location=Acapulco, Guerrero |language=Spanish |accessdate=January 10, 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100106163237/http://www.arquidiocesisacapulco.org/| archivedate= January 6, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s, new hotel resorts were built, and accommodation and transport were made cheaper. It was no longer necessary to be a millionaire to spend a holiday in Acapulco; the foreign and Mexican middle class could now afford to travel here.&lt;ref name=&quot;nileg&quot;/&gt; However, as more hotels were built in the south part of the bay, the old hotels of the 1950s lost their grandeur.&lt;ref name=&quot;lacey&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Acapulco, Long Dotted With Tourists, Is Now Home to Drug War |first=Marc |last=Lacey |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/09/world/americas/09mexico.html |newspaper=New York Times |location=New York, NY |date=June 8, 2009 |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, there was a significant expansion of the port.&lt;ref name=&quot;apiacapulco&quot;/&gt;

The [[Miss Universe 1978]] pageant took place in the city. In 1983, singer-songwriter [[Juan Gabriel]] wrote the song &quot;Amor eterno&quot;, which pays homage to Acapulco. The song was first and most famously recorded by [[Rocio Durcal]]. Additionally, Acapulco is the hometown of actress, singer and comedian [[Aida Pierce|Aída Pierce]], who found fame during the 1980s, 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century.

During the 1990s, the road known as the Ruta del Sol was built, crossing the mountains between Mexico City and Acapulco. The journey takes only about three and a half hours, making Acapulco a favorite weekend destination for Mexico City inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;nileg&quot;/&gt; It was in that time period that the economic impact of Acapulco as a tourist destination increased positively and as a result a new type of services emerged like the [[Colegio Nautilus]]. This educational project, backed by the state government, was created for the families of local and foreign investors and businessmen living in Acapulco who were in need of a bilingual and international education for their children.

The port continued to grow and in 1996, a new private company, API Acapulco, was created to manage operations. This consolidated operations and now Acapulco is the major port for car exports to the Pacific.&lt;ref name=&quot;apiacapulco&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Acapulco zona hotelera 02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Acapulco skyline]]
The city was devastated by [[Hurricane Pauline]] in 1997. The storm stranded tourists and left more than 100 dead in the city. Most of the victims were from the [[shantytown]]s built on steep hillsides that surround the city. Other victims were swept away by thirty-foot waves and {{convert|150|mph|0|abbr=on}} winds. The main road, Avenida Costera, became a fast-moving three-foot-deep river of sludge.&lt;ref name=&quot;davison&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=109 dead as Hurricane Pauline batters Mexico |first=Phil |last= Davison |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/109-dead-as-hurricane-pauline-batters-mexico-1234952.html |newspaper= The Independent |location= London |date=October 10, 1997  |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
In the 2000s, the [[Mexican Drug War|drug war in Mexico]] has had a negative effect on tourism in Acapulco as rival drug traffickers fight each other for the Guerrero coast route that brings drugs from South America as well as soldiers that have been fighting the cartels since 2006.

It was stated by the Dirección General de Aeronáutica Civil that the amount of international flyers coming to Acapulco decreased from 355,760 flyers registered in 2006 to 52,684 flyers in the year 2015, the amount of international tourists flying to Acapulco lost 85% in the interval of nine years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/empresas/acapulco-pierde-85-turistas-internacionales-en-anos.html| Retrieved March 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and climate==
The city, located on the Pacific coast of [[Mexico]] in the state of [[Guerrero]], is classified as one of the state's seven regions, dividing the rest of the Guerrero coast into the [[Costa Grande of Guerrero|Costa Grande]] and the [[Costa Chica of Guerrero|Costa Chica]].&lt;ref name=&quot;regionalizacion&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guerrero |title=Regionalización |year=2010 |work=Enciclopedia de Los Municipios y Delegaciones de México Estado de Guerrero |publisher=INAFED Instituto para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal SEGOB Secretaría de Gobernación |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Regions |accessdate=April 18, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306003153/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guerrero |archivedate=March 6, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Forty percent of the municipality is mountainous terrain. Another forty percent is semi-flat, and the other twenty percent is flat. Altitude varies from sea level to {{convert|1699|m|ft|0|abbr=off}}. The highest peaks are Potrero, San Nicolas and Alto Camarón. There is one major river, the Papagayo, which runs through the municipality, along with a number of arroyos. There are also two small lagoons, Tres Palos and Coyuca. along with a number of thermal springs.
Acapulco features a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system|Köppen]]: Aw): hot with distinct wet and dry seasons, with more even temperatures between seasons than resorts farther north in [[Mexico]], but this varies depending on altitude. The warmest areas are next to the sea where the city is. Tropical storms and hurricanes are threats from May through November. The forested area tends to lose leaves during the winter dry season, with evergreen pines in the highest elevations. Fauna consists mostly of deer, small mammals, a wide variety of both land and sea birds, and marine animals such as turtles.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt;

==Government==
{{Main article|Acapulco (municipality)}}
[[File:Flag of Mexico in Acapulco.jpg|thumb|right|250px| A view of Acapulco's beach with a [[Banderas monumentales|Bandera monumental]] in the background]]
As the seat of a municipality, the city of Acapulco is the government authority for over 700 other communities,&lt;ref name=&quot;INEGI&quot;/&gt; which together have a territory of 1,880.60&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt; This municipality borders the municipalities of Chilpancingo, [[Juan R. Escudero (municipality)|Juan R Escudero (Tierra Colorada)]], [[San Marcos, Guerrero|San Marcos]], [[Coyuca de Benítez]] with the Pacific Ocean to the south.

The metropolitan area is made up of the municipalities of Acapulco de Juárez and Coyuca de Benitez. The area has a population ({{as of|2005|lc=y}}) of 786,830.&lt;ref name=&quot;zmpdf&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.org.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/geografia/publicaciones/delimex05/DZMM-2005_17.pdf |title=Delimitación de las zonas metropolitanas de México 2005 |year=2005 |publisher=INEGI |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans_title=Defining metropolitan areas of Mexico 2005 |accessdate=January 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722203110/http://www.inegi.org.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/geografia/publicaciones/delimex05/DZMM-2005_17.pdf |archivedate=July 22, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Tourism is the main economic activity of the municipality and most of this is centered on Acapulco Bay. About seventy-three percent of the municipality's population is involved in commerce, most of it related to tourism and the port. Mining and manufacturing employ less than twenty percent and only about five percent is dedicated to agriculture. Industrial production is limited mostly to bottling, milk products, cement products, and ice and energy production. Agricultural products include tomatoes, corn, watermelon, beans, green chili peppers, and melons.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt;

The &quot;original&quot; Acapulco, where hotels like Hotel Los Flamingos, owned by personalities [[Johnny Weissmuller]] and [[John Wayne]] are located, is on the northern end of the bay.  This area is part of the &quot;traditional zone&quot;, anchored by attractions such as the beaches of Caleta and Caletilla, the cliff divers of La Quebrada, and the city square, known as &quot;El Zocalo.&quot;  The &quot;heyday&quot; of this part of Acapulco ran from the late 30s until the 60s.   Starting in the late 50s, and with development continuing through the 80s, the main area of Acapulco bay grew into what as known at the &quot;Zona Dorada&quot; or Golden Zone.  This is where the boardwalk and main square are and today the area is filled with modern, Mexican and International branded hotels, with discothèques and restaurants within walking distance.&lt;ref name=&quot;mikerita&quot;/&gt; This area also has the higher hotel occupancy rates.&lt;ref name=&quot;salvar&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;devlin&quot; /&gt;

South of the bay connected by the highway La Escenia holds the newer constructions, including high-rise hotels and condominios. This area known simply as &quot;Acapulco Diamante&quot; includes Playa Diamante, Puerto Marqués, and stretches from the airport to the mountains that separates it from the bay.  In this area, all along Boulevard de Las Naciones  no one walks, as almost all transportation is by car, limousine or golf cart.&lt;ref name=&quot;salvar&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mikerita&quot;/&gt; The older section of town now caters to mostly middle class, almost exclusively Mexican clientele, while the glitzier newer section caters to the Mexican upper classes, many of whom never venture into the older, traditional part of town.&lt;ref name=&quot;mikerita&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;devlin&quot;/&gt;

Acapulco's reputation is that of a high-energy party town, where one can &quot;have dinner at midnight, dance until dawn then relax in the daytime on the beach. The nightlife has long been a major tourist draw of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;introfromm&quot;/&gt; From November to April, luxury liners stop here daily and include ships such as the [[MS Queen Victoria|MS ''Queen Victoria'']], the [[MS Rotterdam|MS ''Rotterdam'']], ''[[Crystal Harmony]]'', and all the Princess line ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;mikerita&quot;/&gt; Despite Acapulco's international fame, most of its visitors are from central Mexico, especially the affluent from Mexico City.&lt;ref name=&quot;salvar&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;introfromm&quot;/&gt; Acapulco is one of the embarkation ports for the Mexican cruise line [[Ocean Star Cruises]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OSC-Acapulco&quot;&gt;[http://oceanstar.com.mx/los-destinos/acapulco Ocean Star Cruises – Acapulco] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110160352/http://oceanstar.com.mx/los-destinos/acapulco |date=November 10, 2011 }}, Retrieved August 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Christmas season of 2009, Acapulco received 470,000 visitors, most of whom are Mexican nationals, adding 785 million pesos to the economy. Eighty percent arrive by land and 18 percent by air.&lt;ref name=&quot;AgUni&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Guerrero-Turismo |agency= Agencia el Universal. |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=January 4, 2010 |page=12 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Guerrero-Tourism }}&lt;/ref&gt; The area has over 25,000 condominiums, most of which function as second homes for their Mexican owners.&lt;ref name=&quot;salvar&quot;/&gt; Acapulco is still popular with Mexican celebrities and the wealthy, such as [[Luis Miguel]], [[Plácido Domingo]], and [[Dolores Olmedo]], who maintain homes here.&lt;ref name=&quot;mikerita&quot;/&gt;

[[File:JLNYCAcapulcoBay.jpg|left|thumb|Marqués Port]]
While much of the glitz and glamour that made Acapulco famous still remains, from the latter 20th century on, the city has also taken on other less-positive reputations. Some consider it a &quot;passé&quot; resort, eclipsed by the newer [[Cancún]] and [[Cabo San Lucas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;introfromm&quot;/&gt; Over the years, a number of problems have developed here, especially in the bay and the older sections of the city. The large number of wandering vendors on the beaches such as Tamarindos, who offer everything from newspapers to massages, are a recognized problem. It is a bother to tourists who simply want to relax on the beach, but the government says it is difficult to eradicate, as there is a lot of unemployment and poverty here.&lt;ref name=&quot;ambulantaje&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Combaten ambulantaje en Acapulco |first=Alfonso |last=Juarez |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=December 30, 2009 |page=12 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Combating wandering vendors in Acapulco }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the city are many small shantytowns that cling to the mountainsides, populated by migrants who have come here looking for work.  In the last decade, drug-related violence has caused problems for the local tourism trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;introfromm&quot;/&gt;

Another problem is garbage that has accumulated in the bay. Although 60.65 tons have recently been extracted from the bays of Acapulco and nearby Zihuatanejo, more needs to be done. Most of trash removal during the off seasons is done on the beaches and in the waters closest to them. However, the center of the bay is not touched. The reason trash winds up in the bay is that it is common here to throw it in streets, rivers and the bay itself. The most common items cleaned out of the bay are beer bottles and car tires.&lt;ref name=&quot;limpiar&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Buscan en Guerrero limpiar fondo de mar |first=Alfonso |last=Juarez |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=December 28, 2009 |page=8 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Seeking to clean the bottom of the sea in Guerrero }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Acapulco has seen some success in this area, having several beaches receiving the high &quot;blue flag&quot; certifications for cleanliness and water quality

===Gastronomy===
Acapulco's gastronomy is very rich, the following are typical dishes from the region:
'''Relleno''' is baked pork with a variety of vegetables and fruits such as potatoes, raisins, carrots and chiles. It is eaten with bread called bolillo.
'''Pozole''' is a soup with a salsa base (it can be white, red or green),corn, meat that can be either pork or chicken and it is accompanied with 'antojitos' like tostadas, tacos and tamales.  This dish is served as part of a weekly Thursday event in the city and the state, with many restaurants offering the meal with special entertainment, from bands to dancers to celebrity impersonators.

===Attractions===
[[File:Papagayo Park in Acapulco Mexico 1.jpg|thumb|right|Papagayo Park]]
Acapulco's main attraction is its nightlife, as it has been for many decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;introfromm&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nightfromm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.frommers.com/destinations/acapulco/0036010030.html |title= Nightlife |publisher=Frommer's Guides |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nightclubs change names and owners frequently.
For example, Baby ‘O has been open to the national and international public since 1976 and different celebrities have visited their installations such as Mexican singer Luis Miguel, Bono from U2 and Sylvester Stallone. Another nightclub is Palladium, located in the Escénica Avenue, the location gives the nightclub a beautiful view of the Santa Lucia Bay at night. Various dj’s have had a performance in Palladium among them DVBBS, Tom Swoon, NERVO and Junkie KID.

Informal lobby or poolside cocktail bars often offer free live entertainment. In addition, there is the beach bar zone, where younger crowds go. These are located along the Costera road, face the ocean and feature techno or alternative rock. Most are concentrated between the Fiesta Americana and Continental Plaza hotels. These places tend to open earlier and have more informal dress. There is a [[bungee jump]] in this area as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/paradisebungyacaoficial/|title=Paradise  Bungy  Acapulco|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another enigmatic attraction at Acapulco are the [[La Quebrada Cliff Divers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;atrfromm&quot;/&gt; The tradition started in the 1930s when young men casually competed against each other to see who could dive from the highest point into the sea below. Eventually, locals began to ask for tips for those coming to see the men dive.&lt;ref name=&quot;guaddive&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://events.frommers.com/sisp/index.htm?fx=event&amp;event_id=44994 |title=Day of the Virgin of Guadalupe Cliff Diving |publisher=Frommer's Guides |accessdate=January 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213013817/http://events.frommers.com/sisp/index.htm?fx=event&amp;event_id=44994 |archivedate=December 13, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the divers are professionals,&lt;ref name=&quot;guaddive&quot;/&gt; diving from heights of {{convert|40|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} into [[La Quebrada, Mexico|an inlet that is only {{convert|7|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|4|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=on}} deep]], after praying first at a shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe.&lt;ref name=&quot;atrfromm&quot;/&gt; On December 12, the feast day of this Virgin, freestyle cliff divers jump into the sea to honor her. Dives range from the simple to the complicated and end with the &quot;Ocean of Fire&quot; when the sea is lit with gasoline, making a circle of flames which the diver aims for.&lt;ref name=&quot;guaddive&quot;/&gt; The spectacle can be seen from a public area which charges a small fee or from the Hotel Plaza Las Glorias/El Mirador from its bar or restaurant terrace.&lt;ref name=&quot;atrfromm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.frommers.com/destinations/acapulco/0036010029.html |title= Attractions |publisher=Frommer's Guides |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of beaches in the Acapulco Bay and the immediate coastline. In the bay proper there are the La Angosta (in the Quebrada), Caleta, Caletilla, Dominguillo, Tlacopanocha, Hornos, Hornitos, Honda, Tamarindo, Condesa, Guitarrón, Icacos, Playuela, Playuelilla and Playa del Secreto. In the adjoining, smaller Bay of Puerto Marqués there is Pichilingue, Las Brisas, and Playa Roqueta. Facing open ocean just northwest of the bays is Pie de la Cuesta and southeast are Playa Revolcadero, Playa Aeromar, Playa Encantada and Barra Vieja. Two lagoons are in the area, Coyuca to the northwest of Acapulco Bay and Tres Palos to the southeast. Both lagoons have mangroves and offer boat tours. Tres Palos also has sea turtle nesting areas which are protected.&lt;ref name=&quot;rutaguer&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |editor1-first= Beatriz |editor1-last= Quintanar Hinojosa |date=May 2007 |title= Acapulco más brillante de nunca |trans_title=Acapulco, more brilliant than ever |journal= Mexico Desconocido Rutas Turisticas Guerrero El destino del Mundo  |volume=135 |pages=8–26 |publisher= Grupo Editorial Impresiones Aéreas |location=Mexico City |issn=0188-5146 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to sunbathing, the beaches around the bay offer a number of services, such as boat rentals, boat tours, horseback riding, scuba diving and other aquatic sports. One popular cruise is from Caletilla Beach to Roqueta Island, which has places to snorkel, have lunch, and a lighthouse. There is also an underwater statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe here, created in 1958 by Armando Quesado in memory of a group of divers who died here. Many of the scuba-diving tours come to this area as well, where there are sunken ships, sea mountains, and cave rock formations.&lt;ref name=&quot;pursfromm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.frommers.com/destinations/acapulco/0036010020.html |title= Active Pursuits &amp; Acapulco Historical Museum  |publisher=Frommer's Guides |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another popular activity is deep-sea fishing. The major attraction is sail fishing. Fish caught here have weighed between 89 and 200&amp;nbsp;pounds. [[Sailfish]] are so plentiful that boat captains have been known to bet with a potential customer that if he does not catch anything, the trip is free.&lt;ref name=&quot;mikerita&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pursfromm&quot;/&gt;

In the old part of the city, there is a traditional main square called the Zócalo, lined with shade trees, cafés and shops. At the north end of the square is Nuestra Señora de la Soledad cathedral, with blue onion-shaped domes and Byzantine towers. The building was originally constructed as a movie set, but was later adapted into a church.&lt;ref name=&quot;pursfromm&quot;/&gt; Acapulco's most historic building is the [[Fort of San Diego]], located east of the main square and originally built in 1616 to protect the city from [[pirate]] attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;atrfromm&quot;/&gt; The fort was partially destroyed by the Dutch in the mid-17th century, rebuilt, then destroyed again in 1776 by an earthquake. It was rebuilt again by 1783 and this is the building that can be seen today, unchanged except for renovations done to it in 2000. Parts of the moats remain as well as the five bulwarks and the battlements.&lt;ref name=&quot;diegofromm&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://events.frommers.com/sisp/index.htm?fx=event&amp;event_id=93584 |title=San Diego Fort &amp; Acapulco Historical Museum |publisher=Frommer's Guides |accessdate=January 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711045257/http://events.frommers.com/sisp/index.htm?fx=event&amp;event_id=93584 |archivedate=July 11, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oliver&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/704-dynamic-women-of-acapulco |title= Dynamic women of Acapulco  |first=Mike |last=Oliver |author2=Rita Oliver |date=January 1, 2001 |publisher=MexConnect |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the fort serves as the Museo Histórico de Acapulco (Acapulco Historical Museum), which shows the port's history from the pre-Hispanic period until independence. There are temporary exhibits as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;atrfromm&quot;/&gt;

The Centro Internacional de Convivencia Infantil or CICI is a sea-life and aquatic park located on Costera Miguel Aleman. It offers wave pools, water slides and water toboggans. There are also dolphin shows daily and a swim with dolphins program. The center mostly caters to children.&lt;ref name=&quot;atrfromm&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rutaguer&quot;/&gt; Another place that is popular with children is the Parque Papagayo: a large family park which has life-sized replicas of a Spanish galleon and the space shuttle Columbia, three artificial lakes, an aviary, a skating rink, rides, go-karts and more.&lt;ref name=&quot;rutaguer&quot;/&gt;

The Dolores Olmedo House is located in the traditional downtown of Acapulco and is noted for the murals by [[Diego Rivera]] that adorn it. Olmedo and Rivera had been friend since Olmedo was a child and Rivera spent the last two years of his life here. During that time, he painted nearly nonstop and created the outside walls with tile mosaics, featuring Aztec deities such as [[Quetzalcoatl]]. The interior of the home is covered in murals. The home is not a museum, so only the outside murals are able to be seen by the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;oliver&quot;/&gt;

There is a small museum called Casa de la Máscara (House of Masks) which is dedicated to masks, most of them from Mexico, but there are examples from many parts of the world. The collection contains about one thousand examples and is divided into seven rooms called Masks of the World, Mexico across History, The [[Huichol people|Huichol]]s and the Jaguar, Alebrijes and Dances of Guerrero, Devils and Death, Identity and Fantasy, and Afro-Indian masks.&lt;ref name=&quot;rutaguer&quot;/&gt;
The Botanical Garden of Acapulco is a tropical garden located on lands owned by the Universidad Loyola del Pacífico. Most of the plants here are native to the region, and many, such as the [[Peltogyne mexicana]] or purple stick tree, are in danger of extinction.&lt;ref name=&quot;rutaguer&quot;/&gt;

One cultural event that is held yearly in Acapulco is the Festival Internacional de la Nao, it takes place in the Fort of San Diego, located near the Zócalo in downtown of the city. The Festival honors the remembrance of the city’s interaction and trades with Oriental territories which started back in the Sixteenth Century. The Nao Festival consists of cultural activities with the support of organizations and embassies from India, China, Japan, Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea. The variety of events go from film projections, musical interpretations and theatre to gastronomical classes, some of the events are specifically for kids.&lt;ref&gt;http://acapulco.gob.mx/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/LaNao2016_Programa.pdf

The annual French Festival takes place throughout Acapulco city and offers a multitude of events that cement cultural links between Mexico and France. The main features are a fashion show and a gourmet food fair. The Cinépolis Galerías Diana and the Teatro Juan Ruíz de Alarcón present French and French literary figures who give talks on their specialised subjects. Even some of the local nightclubs feature French DJs.&lt;ref name=&quot;frenfromm&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://events.frommers.com/sisp/index.htm?fx=event&amp;event_id=158831 |title=Acapulco French Festival |publisher=Frommer's Guides |accessdate=January 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711045317/http://events.frommers.com/sisp/index.htm?fx=event&amp;event_id=158831 |archivedate=July 11, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other festivals celebrated here include [[Carnival]], the feast of San Isidro Labrador on 15 May, and in November, a crafts and livestock fair called the Nao de China.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt;

There are a number of golf courses in Acapulco including the Acapulco Princess and the Pierre Marqués course, the latter designed by [[Robert Trent Jones]] in 1972 for the [[World Cup (men's golf)|World Cup Golf Tournament]]. The Mayan Palace course was designed by [[Pedro Guericia]] and an economical course called the Club de Golf Acapulco is near the convention center. The most exclusive course is that of the Tres Vidas Golf Club, designed by [[Robert von Hagge]]. It is located next to the ocean and is home to flocks of ducks and other birds.&lt;ref name=&quot;pursfromm&quot;/&gt;

Another famous sport tournament that has been held in Acapulco since 1993 is the Abierto Mexicano Telcel, a 500 ATP that takes place in the tennis courts of the Princess Mundo Imperial, a resort located in the Diamante zone of Acapulco. Initially it was played in clay courts but it changed to hard court. The event has gained popularity within the passing of the years, in 2017 the tournament took place from the 27th of February to the 4th of March. The athletes who participated in the competition were some of the most famous players in the last couple of years, among them were Novak Djokovic currently ranked second, Rafael Nadal positioned sixth in the ranking and Marin Cilic who is the number eight in the ranking.
The prizes are $250,000.00 USD for WTA and $1,200,000.00 USD for ATP.&lt;ref&gt;

===Spring break===
Over 100,000 American teenagers and young adults travel to resort areas and [[balneario]]s throughout [[Mexico]] during spring break each year.&lt;ref name=&quot;stategov&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/spring_break_mexico/spring_break_mexico_2812.html |title= SPRING BREAK IN MEXICO – &quot;Know Before You Go!&quot; |publisher=United States State Department |accessdate=January 11, 2010|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625203348/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/spring_break_mexico/spring_break_mexico_2812.html |archivedate = June 25, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason students head to Mexico is the 18-year-old drinking age (versus 21 for the United States), something that has been marketed by tour operators along with the sun and ocean. This has become attractive since the 1990s, especially since more traditional spring break places such as [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], have enacted restrictions on drinking and other behaviors. This legislation has pushed spring break visitation to various parts of Mexico, with Acapulco as one of the top destinations.&lt;ref name=&quot;leinwand&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Alcohol-soaked spring break lures students abroad |first= Donna |last= Leinwand |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-01-05-spring-break-usat_x.htm |newspaper= |publisher= USA TODAY |date=January 5, 2003 |accessdate=January 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, [[Cancún]] had been favored as the spring break destination of choice. However, Cancún has taken some steps to control the reckless behavior associated with the event, and students have been looking for someplace new. This has led many more to choose Acapulco, in spite of the fact that for many travelers, the flight is longer and more expensive than to Cancún. Many are attracted by the glitzy hotels on the south side and Acapulco's famous nightlife.&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Acapulco heat for spring-break |first=Will |last=Weissert |url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7119929/ |newspaper=MSNBC |date=March 7, 2005 |accessdate=January 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, 22,500 students came to Acapulco for spring break. Hotels did not get that many in 2009, due mostly to the economic situation in the United States,&lt;ref name=&quot;crisis&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Springbreak baja por crisis, no por violencia: hoteleros |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/583257.html |newspaper= El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=March 12, 2009 |accessdate= January 11, 2010|language=Spanish |trans_title=Spring Break lower because of crisis, not violence: hotel managers}}&lt;/ref&gt; and partially because of scares of drug-related violence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news |title= At Spring Break in Mexico, Revelry Mixes With New Caution |first=Marc |last= Lacey |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/world/americas/11cancun.html?_r=1|newspaper= New York Times |location=New York, NY |date=March 10, 2009 |accessdate= January 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, the US State Department issued a travel alert directed at college students planning spring break trips to Acapulco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/pa/pa_3028.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320162337/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/pa/pa_3028.html |archivedate=March 20, 2009 |title=Travel Alert}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warning—a result of violent activity springing from Mexico's drug cartel débâcle—took college campuses by storm, with some schools going so far as to warn their students about the risks of travel to Mexico over spring break. The New York Times tracked the travels of a Penn student on spring break in Acapulco just a week after the dissemination of the email, while [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] devoted a segment of his show, ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', to urge students to stay away from Acapulco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/world/americas/11cancun.html | work=The New York Times | title=At Spring Break in Mexico, Revelry Mixes With New Caution | first=Marc | last=Lacey | date=March 11, 2009 | accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, a number of incidents occurred between the drug cartel and the government. These included coordinated attacks on police headquarters and open battles in the streets, involving large-caliber weapons and grenades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/americas/06/08/mexico.violence/index.html | work=CNN | title=3 Mexican officers killed in Acapulco - CNN.com | accessdate=April 23, 2010 | date=June 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no incidents of violence against spring breakers were reported.

==Transportation==
[[File:Acapulco - Aeropuerto Internacional Juan N. Álvarez.JPG|thumb|[[General Juan N. Álvarez International Airport]]]]
[[File:Cruise in Acapulco, Mexico.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cruising at the [[International Transatlantic Port Lieutenant José Azueta]]]]
[[File:Avenida Costera Miguel Alemán de Acapulco, México.jpg|thumb|right|Acapulco's Miguel Alemán Coastal Avenue]]
From the U.S., many airlines now fly to [[General Juan N. Álvarez International Airport|Juan N. Álvarez International Airport]] year-round. In the city, there are many buses and taxi services one can take to get from place to place, but most of the locals choose to walk to their destinations. However, an important mode of transportation is the government subsidized 'Colectivo' cab system. These cabs cost 13 [[Mexican peso|pesos]] per person to ride, but they are not private. The driver will pick up more passengers as long as seats are available, and will transport them to their destination based on first-come first-served rules. The colectivos each travel a designated area of the city, the three main ones being Costera, Colosio, Coloso, or a mixture of the three. Coloso cabs travel mainly to old Acapulco. Colosio cabs travel through most of the tourist area of Acapulco. Costera cabs drive up and down the coast of Acapulco, where most of the hotels for visitors are located, but which includes some of old Acapulco. Where a driver will take you is partly his choice. Some are willing to travel to the other designated areas, especially during slow periods of the day.

The bus system is highly complex and can be rather confusing to an outsider. As far as transportation goes, it is the cheapest form, other than walking, in Acapulco. The most expensive buses have air conditioning, while the cheaper buses do not. For tourists, the Acapulco city government has established a system of yellow buses with Acapulco painted on the side of them. These buses are not for tourists only, but are certainly the nicest and most uniform of the bus systems. These buses travel the tourist section of Acapulco, driving up and down the coast. There are buses with specific routes and destinations, generally written on their windshields or shouted out by a barker riding in the front seat. Perhaps the most unusual thing about the privately operated buses is the fact that they are all highly decorated and personalized, with decals and home-made interior designs that range from comic book scenes, to pornography, and even to &quot;[[Hello Kitty]]&quot; themes.

The conflictive public transportation would be upgraded the 25th of June 2016 with the implementation of the Acabus. The Acabus infrastructure has a length of {{convert|36.2|km|abbr=off}}, counts with 16 stations that spread through the city of Acapulco and 5 routes. This project will help organize traffic because the buses now have a specific line on the roads and there would be more control over transportation and passengers.&lt;ref&gt;https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acabús.
