'''Antigua and Barbuda''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Antiga and Barbuda.ogg|æ|n|ˈ|t|iː|ɡ|ə|_|ə|n|d|_|b|ɑːr|ˈ|b|juː|d|ə}}; {{respell|an|TEE|gǝ|_|ǝnd|_|bar|BEW|dǝ}}) is a [[sovereign state]] in the [[Americas]], lying between the [[Caribbean Sea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It consists of two major islands, [[Antigua]] and [[Barbuda]], and a number of smaller islands (including [[Great Bird Island, Antigua|Great Bird]], [[Green Island (Antigua and Barbuda)|Green]], [[Guiana Island|Guiana]], [[Long Island (Antigua and Barbuda)|Long]], [[Maiden Island (Antigua and Barbuda)|Maiden]] and [[York Island (Antigua and Barbuda)|York Islands]] and further south, the island of [[Redonda]]). The permanent population numbers about 81,800 (at the 2011 Census) and the capital and largest port and city is [[St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda|St. John's]], on Antigua.

Lying near each other (the main [[Barbuda Codrington Airport|Barbuda airport]] is less than [[Latitude|0.5° of latitude]], or 30 [[nautical miles]], north of the main [[V. C. Bird International Airport|Antigua airport]]), Antigua and Barbuda are in the middle of the [[Leeward Islands]], part of the [[Lesser Antilles]], roughly at [[17th parallel north|17°N]] of the [[equator]]. The country's name was given by [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1493 after discovering the island, in honor of the Virgin of La Antigua in the [[Seville Cathedral]]. The country is nicknamed &quot;Land of 365 Beaches&quot; due to the many beaches surrounding the islands. Its governance, language, and culture have all been strongly influenced by the [[British Empire]], of which the country was formerly a part, gaining sovereignty on 1 November 1981. It remains a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] is the head of state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/countries/antigua-barbuda|title=Antigua and Barbuda - Countries - Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, [[Hurricane Irma]] damaged or destroyed 95% of Barbuda's buildings and infrastructure. Everyone on the island was evacuated to Antigua.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Panzar |first1=Javier |last2=Willsher |first2=Kim |date=9 September 2017 |title=Hurricane Irma leaves Caribbean Islands Devastated |url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-irma-islands-20170909-story.html |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island struggled to accommodate the additional population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/damage-hurricane-irma-caribbean-49703893|title=A look at the damage from Hurricane Irma in the Caribbean|first=ABC|last=News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/09/14/barbuda-hurricane-irama-devastation/665950001/|title='For first time in 300 years, there’s not a single living person on the island of Barbuda'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 18, Hurricane Watches were issued for the island again ahead of [[Hurricane Maria (2017)|Hurricane Maria]].

== Etymology ==
''{{lang|es|Antigua}}'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;ancient&quot; and ''{{lang|es|barbuda}}'' is Spanish for &quot;bearded&quot;. The island of Antigua, originally called ''{{lang|tnq|Wa'ladli}}'' by [[Arawak]]s, is today called ''Wadadli'' by locals; [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] possibly called it ''{{lang|crb|Wa'omoni}}''. [[Christopher Columbus]], while sailing by in 1493 may have named it Santa Maria la Antigua, after an icon in the Spanish [[Seville Cathedral]].

==History==
{{Main article|History of Antigua and Barbuda}}

Antigua was first settled by archaic age hunter-gatherer [[Amerindian]]s called the Siboney or [[Ciboney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction ::Antigua and Barbuda|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ac.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radiocarbon dating|Carbon dating]] has established the earliest settlements started around 3100 BC. They were succeeded by the ceramic age pre-Columbian [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]]-speaking [[Saladoid]] people who migrated from the lower [[Orinoco River]].

The [[Arawaks]] introduced agriculture, raising, among other crops, the famous Antigua black pineapple (Moris cultivar of ''[[Ananas comosus]]''), [[maize|corn]], [[sweet potato]]es, [[chili pepper|chiles]], [[guava]], [[tobacco]], and [[cotton]].

The indigenous West Indians made excellent seagoing vessels which they used to sail around on the Atlantic and the Caribbean. As a result, Caribs and Arawaks were able to colonise much of South America and the Caribbean Islands. Their descendants still live there, notably in Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia.

Most Arawaks left Antigua around 1100 AD; those who remained were later raided by the [[Island Caribs|Caribs]]. According to the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', the Caribs' superior weapons and seafaring prowess allowed them to defeat most of the West Indian Arawak nations, enslaving some and possibly [[cannibalism|cannibalising]] others.
[[File:The Mill Yard - Ten Views in the Island of Antigua (1823), plate V - BL.jpg|thumb|left|Antigua in 1823]]

The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' makes it clear that the European invaders had difficulty differentiating between the various groups of the native peoples they encountered. As a result, the number and types of ethnic/tribal groups in existence at that time may have been much more varied and numerous than just the two mentioned in this article.

European and African diseases, malnutrition, and slavery eventually killed most of the Caribbean's native population. [[Smallpox]] was probably the greatest killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Austin Alchon| first = Suzanne| title = A pest in the land: new world epidemics in a global perspective| url = https://books.google.com/?id=YiHHnV08ebkC&amp;pg=PA62| year = 2003| publisher = University of New Mexico Press| isbn = 0-8263-2871-7| pages = 62–63 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians{{Who|date=March 2011}} believe that the psychological stress of slavery may also have played a part in the massive number of deaths amongst enslaved natives. Others believe the reportedly abundant but starchy, low-protein diet may have contributed to their severe malnutrition as they were used to a diet fortified with protein from the sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rogozinski&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=A Brief History of the Caribbean |first=Jan |last=Rogozinski |publisher=Penguin Putnam, Inc. |date=September 2000 |isbn=0-452-28193-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spaniards did not colonise Antigua because it lacked fresh water but not aggressive Caribs. The English settled on Antigua in 1632; Christopher Codrington settled on Barbuda in 1684. [[Slavery]], established to run sugar plantations around 1684, was abolished in 1834. The British ruled from 1632 to 1981, with a brief [[France|French]] interlude in 1666.

The islands became an independent state within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] on 1 November 1981, with [[Elizabeth II]] as the first [[Monarchy in Antigua and Barbuda|Queen of Antigua and Barbuda]]. [[Vere Cornwall Bird Sr]] became the first Prime Minister.

Most of Barbuda was devastated in early September 2017 by [[Hurricane Irma]], which brought winds with speeds reaching 295 km/h (185 mph). The storm damaged or destroyed 95% of the island's buildings and infrastructure, leaving Barbuda &quot;barely habitable&quot; according to Prime Minister Gaston Browne. Nearly everyone on the island was evacuated to Antigua.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main article|Geography of Antigua and Barbuda}}

[[File:ac-map.gif|thumb|350px|A map of Antigua and Barbuda]]
[[File:Antigue 34622.jpg|thumb|English Harbour, Antigua]]
Antigua and Barbuda both are generally low-lying islands whose terrain has been influenced more by [[limestone]] formations than [[Volcanism|volcanic activity]]. The highest point on Antigua is [[Mount Obama]] (formerly Boggy Peak), the remnant of a [[volcanic]] crater rising {{convert|402|m|abbr=off}}.

The shorelines of both islands are greatly indented with beaches, lagoons, and natural harbours. The islands are rimmed by reefs and shoals. There are few streams as rainfall is slight. Both islands lack adequate amounts of fresh groundwater.

=== Climate ===
Rainfall averages {{convert|990|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} per year, with the amount varying widely from season to season. In general the wettest period is between September and November. The islands generally experience low humidity and recurrent droughts. Temperatures average {{convert|27|°C|1}}, with a range from {{convert|23|°C|1}} to {{convert|29|°C|1}} in the winter to from {{convert|25|°C|1}} to {{convert|30|°C|1}} in the summer and autumn. The coolest period is between December and February.

[[Hurricane]]s strike on an average of once a year, including the powerful [[Saffir–Simpson scale#Category 5|Category 5]] [[Hurricane Irma]], on 6 September 2017, which damaged 95% of the structures on Barbuda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/06/us/hurricane-irma-puerto-rico-florida/index.html |title=Hurricane Irma: Powerful storm blamed for three deaths |first1=Jason |last1=Hanna |first2=Joe |last2=Sterling|first3=Steve |last3=Almasy |work=ABS TV Radio Antigua &amp; Barbuda |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=2017-09-06 |accessdate=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 1,800 people were evacuated to Antigua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-irma-islands-20170909-story.html|title=Hurricane Irma leaves Caribbean islands devastated|first=Javier|last=Panzar|date=9 September 2017|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimate published by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' indicated that over $100 million would be required to rebuild homes and infrastructure. Philmore Mullin, Director of Barbuda's National Office of Disaster Services, said that &quot;all critical infrastructure and utilities are non-existent – food supply, medicine, shelter, electricity, water, communications, waste management&quot;. He summarised the situation as follows: &quot;Public utilities need to be rebuilt in their entirety... It is optimistic to think anything can be rebuilt in six months ... In my 25 years in disaster management, I have never seen something like this.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4935433/hurricane-irma-barbuda-antigua-survivors-caribbean/|title=Hurricane Irma Flattens Barbuda, Leaving Population Stranded|first=Tara John /|last=Antigua|website=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecology ===
The sandy soil on much of the islands has only scrub vegetation. Some parts of Antigua are more fertile–most notably the central plain–due to the [[volcanic ash]] in the soil. These areas support some tropical vegetation and agricultural uses. The planting of [[acacia]], [[mahogany]], and red and white cedar on Antigua has led to as much as 11% of the land becoming forested, helping to conserve the soil and water.

===Political system===
{{Main article|Politics of Antigua and Barbuda}}

[[File:St Johns Antigua 2012.jpg|thumb|300px|Downtown St. John's on Antigua.]]
The politics of Antigua and Barbuda take place within a framework of a [[Unitary state|unitary]], [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]], [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[monarchy]], in which the [[Head of State]] is the [[Monarch]] who appoints the [[List of Governors-General of Antigua and Barbuda|Governor General]] as vice-regal representative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antigua and Barbuda 1981|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Antigua_and_Barbuda_1981?lang=en|website=Constitute|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth II]] is the present [[Monarch of Antigua and Barbuda|Queen of Antigua and Barbuda]], having served in that position since the islands' independence from the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|United Kingdom]] in 1981. The Queen is currently represented by Governor General [[Rodney Williams (politician)|Sir Rodney Williams]]. A Council of Ministers is appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the [[List of Prime Ministers of Antigua and Barbuda|Prime Minister]], currently [[Gaston Browne]] (2014–). The Prime Minister is the [[Head of Government]].

[[Executive power]] is exercised by the government while [[legislative power]] is vested in both the [[Forms of government|government]] and the two Chambers of [[Parliament of Antigua and Barbuda|Parliament]]. The [[bicameral]] Parliament consists of the Senate (17 members appointed by members of the government and the [[Official Opposition|opposition]] party, and approved by the Governor-General), and the House of Representatives (17 members elected by [[first past the post]]) to serve five-year terms.

The current Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition is the United Progressive Party Member of Parliament (MP), the Honourable [[Baldwin Spencer]].

=== Political culture ===
[[File:Antigua.St.John.from west.wmt.jpg|thumb|300px|St. John's parish on Antigua.]]

[[Gaston Browne]] defeated his predecessor [[Lester Bryant Bird]] at the Antigua Labour Party's biennial convention in November 2012 held to elect a political leader and other officers. The party then altered its name from the [[Antigua Labour Party]] (ALP) to the Antigua &amp; Barbuda Labour Party (ABLP). This was done to officially include the party's presence on the sister island of Barbuda in its organisation, the only political party on the mainland to have a physical branch in Barbuda.

The last elections held were on 12 June 2014, during which the [[Antigua Labour Party]] won 14 seats, and the [[United Progressive Party (Antigua and Barbuda)|United Progressive Party]] 3 seats.

Since 1949, the party system had been dominated by the [[populism|populist]] Antigua Labour Party. However, the [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 2004|Antigua and Barbuda legislative election of 2004]] saw the defeat of the longest-serving elected government in the Caribbean. Prime Minister [[Lester Bird|Lester Bryant Bird]], who had succeeded his father Vere Cornwall Bird Sr., and Deputy Robin Yearwood had been in office since 1976.

The elder Bird was Prime Minister from 1981 to 1994 and Chief Minister of Antigua from 1960 to 1981, except for the 1971–1976 period when the Progressive Labour Movement (PLM) defeated his party. Vere Cornwall Bird, the nation's first Prime Minister, is credited with having brought Antigua and Barbuda and the Caribbean into a new era of independence.

=== Judiciary ===
The Judicial branch is the [[Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court]] (based in Saint Lucia; one judge of the Supreme Court is a resident of the islands and presides over the High Court of Justice). Antigua is also a member of the [[Caribbean Court of Justice]]. The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] serves as its Supreme Court of Appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caribbean Court of Justice|url=http://www.ijrcenter.org/regional-communities/caribbean-court-of-justice/|website=International Justice Resource Center|date=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign relations===
{{Main article|Foreign relations of Antigua and Barbuda}}

Antigua and Barbuda is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[Caribbean Community]], the [[Organization of Eastern Caribbean States]], the [[Organization of American States]], the [[World Trade Organization]] and the Eastern Caribbean's Regional Security System.

Antigua and Barbuda is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] (with a [[Bilateral Immunity Agreement]] of Protection for the US military as covered under Article 98 of the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]]).

In 2013, Antigua and Barbuda called for [[reparations for slavery]] at the United Nations. Prime Minister [[Baldwin Spencer]] said &quot;We have recently seen a number of leaders apologising&quot;, and that they should now &quot;match their words with concrete and material benefits&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21587236-pressure-grows-compensation-caribbean-trade-blood-money |title=Slavery reparations: Blood money |publisher=''[[The Economist]]'' |date=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military===
{{Further information|Royal Antigua and Barbuda Defence Force}}

The [[Royal Antigua and Barbuda Defence Force]] has around 260 members dispersed between the line infantry regiment, service and support unit and coast guard. There is also the Antigua and Barbuda Cadet Corps made up of 200 teenagers between the ages of 12 to 18.

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main article|Parishes and dependencies of Antigua and Barbuda}}

Antigua and Barbuda is divided into six parishes and two dependencies:
[[File:Antigua parishes english.png|thumb|Parishes of Antigua]]

{|style=&quot;background:none;&quot;
|
* Parishes
*# [[Saint George Parish, Antigua and Barbuda|Saint George]]
*# [[Saint John Parish, Antigua and Barbuda|Saint John]]

*# [[Saint Philip Parish, Antigua and Barbuda|Saint Philip]]
* Dependencies
*# [[Barbuda]]
*# [[Redonda]]
|style=&quot;width:600px;&quot;|
{{Map of Antigua and Barbuda}}

Note: Though Barbuda and Redonda are called dependencies they are integral parts of the state, making them essentially administrative divisions. Dependency is simply a title.

==Economy==
{{Main article|Economy of Antigua and Barbuda}}
[[File:Tree map export 2009 Antigua and Barbuda.jpeg|thumb|350px|A proportional representation of Antigua and Barbuda's exports.]]
[[Tourism]] dominates the economy, accounting for more than half of the [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP). Antigua is famous for its many luxury resorts. Weak tourist activity since early 2000 has slowed the economy, however, and squeezed the government into a tight fiscal corner.

Investment banking and financial services also make up an important part of the economy. Major world banks with offices in Antigua include the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Scotiabank. Financial-services corporations with offices in Antigua include PriceWaterhouseCoopers. The [[US Securities and Exchange Commission]] has accused the Antigua-based [[Stanford International Bank]], owned by Texas billionaire [[Allen Stanford]], of orchestrating a huge fraud which may have bilked investors of some $8 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/21/business/21stanford.html |work=The New York Times |title=Fraud Case Shakes a Billionaire's Caribbean Realm |first1=Clifford |last1=Krauss |first2=Julie |last2=Creswell |first3=Charlie |last3=Savage |date=21 February 2009 |accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (check status 20100312)

The twin-island nation's [[agriculture|agricultural]] production is focused on its domestic market and constrained by a limited [[water supply]] and a [[labor (economics)|labour]] shortage stemming from the lure of higher wages in tourism and construction work.

[[Manufacturing]] is made up of enclave-type assembly for export, the major products being bedding, handicrafts and electronic components. Prospects for [[economic growth]] in the medium term will continue to depend on income growth in the industrialised world, especially in the [[United States]], from which about one-third of all tourists come.

Following the opening of the American University of Antigua College of Medicine by investor and attorney Neil Simon in 2003, a new source of revenue was established. The university employs many local Antiguans and the approximate 1000 students consume a large amount of the goods and services.

==Demographics==
{{Main article|Demographics of Antigua and Barbuda}}
[[File:Antigua-Barbuda-demography.png|thumb|450px|Antigua &amp; Barbuda's population (1961–2010). Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]

===Ethnic groups===
Antigua has a population of {{UN_Population|Antigua and Barbuda}},{{UN_Population|ref}} mostly made up of people of [[West African]], [[United Kingdom|British]], and [[Portuguese people|Madeiran]] descent. The ethnic distribution consists of 91% Black &amp; Mulatto, 4.4% mixed race, 1.7% White, and 2.9% other (primarily [[South Asians|East Indian]] and other Asian). Most Whites are of Irish or British descent. Christian Levantine Arabs, and a small number of [[Asians]] and [[Sephardic Jews]] make up the remainder of the population.

An increasingly large percentage of the population lives abroad, most notably in the United Kingdom ([[Antiguan British|Antiguan Britons]]), United States and [[Canada]]. A minority of Antiguan residents are immigrants from other countries, particularly from Dominica, Guyana and [[Jamaica]], and, increasing, from the Dominican Republic, [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]] and [[Nigeria]]. An estimated 4,500 American citizens also make their home in Antigua and Barbuda, making their numbers one of the largest American populations in the English-speaking Eastern Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2336.htm |title=Background Note: Antigua and Barbuda |accessdate=23 August 2007|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070814213848/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2336.htm|archivedate= 14 August 2007 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===
English is the official language. The [[Barbuda]]n accent is slightly different from the [[Antigua]]n.

In the years before Antigua and Barbuda's independence, Standard English was widely spoken in preference to Antiguan Creole. Generally, the upper and middle classes shun Antiguan Creole. The educational system dissuades the use of Antiguan Creole and instruction is done in Standard (British) English.

Many of the words used in the Antiguan dialect are derived from [[British English|British]] as well as African languages. This can be easily seen in phrases such as: &quot;Ent it?&quot; meaning &quot;Ain't it?&quot; which is itself dialectal and means &quot;Isn't it?&quot;. Common island [[proverb]]s can often be traced to Africa.

Spanish is spoken by around 10,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/BNCCde/antigua/conference/papers/farquhar.html Bernadette Farquhar – The Spanish Language in Antigua and Barbuda: Implications for Language Planning and Language Research&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715015910/http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/BNCCde/antigua/conference/papers/farquhar.html |date=15 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
[[File:Stjohnscathedralantigua.jpg|thumb|[[St. John's Cathedral, St. John's]]]]

A majority of 77%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ac.html|title=Antigua and Barbuda |publisher=CIA, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of Antiguans are [[Christianity|Christians]], with the [[Anglicans]] (17,6%) being the largest single denomination. Other Christian denominations present are [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] (12,4%), [[Pentecostalism]] (12,2%), [[Moravian Church]] (8,3%), [[Roman Catholics]]
(8,2%), [[Methodist Church]] (5,6%), [[Wesleyan Holiness Church]] (4,5%), [[Church of God]] (4,1%), [[Baptists]] (3,6%), [[Mormons]] (&lt;1,0%), and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].

Non-Christian religions practised in the islands include the [[Rastafari]], [[Islam]], and [[Bahá'í Faith]].

===Education===
{{Main article|Education in Antigua and Barbuda}}
Antigua &amp; Barbuda has a greater than 90% literacy rate. In 1998, Antigua and Barbuda adopted a national mandate to become the pre-eminent provider of medical services in the Caribbean. As part of this mission, Antigua and Barbuda built the most technologically advanced hospital in the Caribbean, the Mt. St. John Medical Centre. The island of Antigua currently has two foreign-owned [[for-profit education|for-profit]] [[offshore medical school]]s, the [[American University of Antigua, College of Medicine|American University of Antigua]] (AUA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auamed.org/ |title=American University of Antigua, College of Medicine |accessdate=23 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822140939/http://www.auamed.org/ |archivedate=22 August 2007 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 2004, and The [[University of Health Sciences Antigua]] (UHSA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uhsa.ag/ |title=University of Health Sciences Antigua |accessdate=23 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1982. The island's sole medical schools cater mostly to foreign students but contribute tremendously to the local economy and health care and help give the small country international attention.

There is also a government owned state college in Antigua as well as the Antigua and Barbuda Institute of Information Technology (ABIIT) and the Antigua and Barbuda Hospitality Training Institute (ABHTI). The University of the West Indies has a branch in Antigua for locals to continue university studies.

Antigua has two international primary/secondary schools Including CCSET International, which offers the Ontario Secondary School Diploma, and Island Academy, which offers the International Baccalaureate. There are also many other private schools but these institutions tend to follow the same local curriculum (CXCs) as government schools. Both international schools are relatively inexperienced with offering international degrees. CCSET international has existed for several years but only began offering an International Degree in 2007. While CCSET's graduating classes have consistently been awarded the OSSD, this is somewhat controversial because CCSET students receive their diplomas from one of CCSET's (constantly changing) partner schools based in Ontario.

==Culture==
{{See also|Music of Antigua and Barbuda}}

The culture is predominantly a mixture of West African and British cultural influences.

Cricket is the national sport and Antigua has produced several famous cricket players including Sir Vivian Richards, Anderson &quot;Andy&quot; Roberts, and Richard &quot;Richie&quot; Richardson. Other popular sports include football, boat racing and surfing. ([[Antigua Sailing Week]] attracts locals and visitors from all over the world).

American popular culture and fashion also have a heavy influence. Most of the country's media is made up of major United States networks. Many Antiguans prefer to make shopping trips to [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].

Family and religion play an important roles in the lives of Antiguans. Most attend religious services on Sunday, although there is a growing number of [[Seventh-day Adventists]] who observe the [[seventh-day Sabbath|Sabbath]] on Saturday.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

[[Calypso music|Calypso]] and [[soca music]], both originating primarily out of [[Trinidad]], are important in Antigua and Barbuda.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geographia.com/antigua-barbuda/agcarn01.htm|title=Antigua &amp; Barbuda – Carnival &amp; Music|website=www.geographia.com|access-date=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Festivals===
{{Further information|List of festivals in Antigua and Barbuda}}
The national Carnival held each August commemorates the abolition of slavery in the [[British West Indies]], although on some islands, Carnival may celebrate the coming of Lent. Its festive pageants, shows, contests and other activities are a major tourist attraction.

===Cuisine===
{{Further information|Antigua and Barbuda cuisine}}

Corn and sweet potatoes play an important role in Antiguan cuisine. For example, a popular Antiguan dish, Dukuna {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|uː|.|k|uː|ˌ|n|ɑː}} is a sweet, steamed dumpling made from grated sweet potatoes, flour and spices. One of the Antiguan staple foods, fungi {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|uː|n|.|dʒ|iː}}, is a cooked paste made of cornmeal and water.

===Media===
There are two daily newspapers: the &quot;Daily Observer&quot; and &quot;Caribbean Times&quot;. Besides most American television networks, the local channel ABS TV 10 is available (it is the only station which shows exclusively local programs). There are also several local and regional radio stations, such as V2C-AM 620, ZDK-AM 1100, VYBZ-FM 92.9, ZDK-FM 97.1, Observer Radio 91.1 FM, DNECA Radio 90.1 FM, Second Advent Radio 101.5 FM, Abundant Life Radio 103.9 FM, Crusader Radio 107.3 FM, Nice FM 104.3

===Sports===
{{See also|Cricket in the West Indies}}

[[File:Cricket ground.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Antigua Recreation Ground]].]]
The [[Antigua and Barbuda national cricket team]] represented the country at the [[1998 Commonwealth Games]], but Antiguan cricketers otherwise play for the [[Leeward Islands cricket team]] in domestic matches and the [[West Indies cricket team]] internationally. The [[2007 Cricket World Cup]] was hosted in the West Indies from 11 March to 28 April 2007.

Antigua hosted eight matches at the [[Sir Vivian Richards Stadium]], which was completed on 11 February 2007 and can hold up to 20,000 people.
Antigua is a Host of [[Stanford Twenty20]] – [[Twenty20 Cricket]], a version started by [[Allen Stanford]] in 2006 as a regional cricket game with almost all Caribbean islands taking part. Antiguan [[Viv Richards]] scored the fastest Test Century and [[Brian Lara]] twice scored the World Test Record at the [[Antigua Recreation Ground]].

[[Rugby football|Rugby]] and [[netball]] are popular as well.

[[Association football]], or soccer, is also a very popular sport. Antigua has a [[Antigua and Barbuda national football team|national football team]] which entered [[FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualification]] for the 1974 tournament and for 1986 and onwards. A professional team was formed in 2011, [[Antigua Barracuda FC]], which played in the [[USL Pro]], a lower professional league in the USA. The nation's team had a major achievement in 2012, getting out of its preliminary group for the 2014 [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], notably due to a victory over powerful [[Haiti]]. In its first game in the next [[CONCACAF]] group play on 8 June 2012 in [[Tampa]], FL, Antigua and Barbuda, comprising 17 Barracuda players and 7 from the lower English professional leagues, scored a goal against the United States, authored by Peter Byers; however, the team lost 3:1 to the US.

[[Athletics (sport)|Athletics]] are popular. Talented athletes are trained from a young age, and Antigua and Barbuda has produced a few fairly adept athletes. Janill Williams, a young athlete with much promise comes from [[Gray's Farm]], Antigua. [[Sonia Williams]] and [[Heather Samuel]] represented Antigua and Barbuda at the [[Olympic Games]]. Other prominent rising stars include [[Brendan Christian]] (100 m, 200 m), [[Daniel Bailey]] (100 m, 200 m) and [[James Grayman]] (high jump).
