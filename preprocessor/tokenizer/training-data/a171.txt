}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still recovering from 27 years of the [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] that plagued the country from its [[Alvor Agreement|independence in 1975]] to 2002. Despite extensive [[Crude oil|oil and gas]] resources, [[diamond]]s, [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] potential, and rich [[Agriculture|agricultural]] land, Angola remains poor, and a third of the population relies on subsistence agriculture. Since 2002, when the 27-year civil war ended, the nation has worked to repair and improve ravaged infrastructure and weakened political and social institutions. High international oil prices and rising oil production have contributed to the very strong economic growth since 1998,&lt;ref&gt;[[Google Public Data]]. Retrieved 2013-8-14.&lt;/ref&gt; but corruption and public-sector mismanagement remain, particularly in the oil sector, which accounts for over 50 percent of GDP, over 90 percent of export revenue, and over 80 percent of government revenue.

==History==
The [[Portuguese exploration of Africa|Portuguese explorer]] [[Diogo Cão]] reached the Angolan coast in 1484,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB9|ref=harv |wstitle=Angola |volume=2  |page=45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after which [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] began to found trading posts and forts along the shore. [[Paulo Dias de Novais]] founded Sāo Paulo de Loanda ([[Luanda]]) in 1575. São Felipe de Benguella ([[Benguela]]) followed in 1587.

The principal early trade was in [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves]]. Portuguese merchants purchased the slaves from the local [[Imbangala]] and [[Northern Mbundu people|Mbundu]] peoples, [[Slavery in Africa|notable slave hunters]], and sold them to the [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]]s in [[Captaincies of Brazil|Brazil]]. Brazilian ships were frequent visitors to Luanda and Benguela and Angola functioned as a kind of colony of Brazil, with Brazilian [[Jesuits]] active in its religious and educational centers.

The [[Portuguese Empire]] was neglected during the period of the [[Iberian Union]], which lasted from 1580 to 1640. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]], bitter enemies of their former masters in [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]], invaded many Portuguese overseas possessions. During Portugal's separatist war against Spain, the Dutch occupied Luanda from 1640 to 1648, calling it &quot;Fort Aardenburgh&quot;. The Dutch used the territory to supply their own slaves to the sugarcane plantations of [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern Brazil]] ([[Pernambuco]], [[Olinda]], [[Recife]]), which they had also seized from Portugal. [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen]], conquered the Portuguese possessions of [[Elmina|Saint George del Mina]], Saint Thomas, and Luanda, Angola, on the west coast of Africa. Portugal recovered the territory between 1648 and 1650.

In the high plains, the Planalto, the most important native states were [[Bié Province|Bié]] and [[Bailundo]], the latter being noted for its production of foodstuffs and rubber. Portugal expanded into their territory,{{when|date=June 2015}} but did not control much of the interior prior to the late 19th century.{{sfn|Baynes|1878|p=45}}

The Portuguese started to develop townships, trading posts, logging camps and small processing factories. From 1764 onwards,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} there was a gradual change from a slave-based society to one based on production for domestic consumption and export. Following the [[independence of Brazil]] in 1822, the slave trade was formally abolished in 1836. However it did continue locally into the 20th century. In 1844, Angola's ports were opened to foreign shipping.

By 1850, Luanda was one of the greatest and most developed Portuguese cities in the vast [[Portuguese Empire]] outside of [[Mainland Portugal]],{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} full of trading companies,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} exporting peanut oil,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} copal,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} timber,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} and cocoa.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The principal exports of the post-slave economy in the 19th century were [[rubber]], beeswax, and ivory.{{sfn|Baynes|1878|p=45}} Maize, tobacco, dried meat and [[cassava]] flour also began to be locally produced.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Prior to the [[First World War]], exportation of [[coffee]], [[palm tree|palm]] kernels and [[palm oil|oil]], [[cattle]], [[leather]] and [[Hide (skin)|hides]], and [[salt fish]] joined the principal exports, with small quantities of gold and [[cotton]] also being produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|ref=harv |wstitle=Angola |volume=2 |page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grains, sugar, and rum were also produced for local consumption.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=39}} The principal imports were foodstuffs, cotton goods, hardware, and British coal.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=39}} Legislation against foreign traders was implemented in the 1890s. The territory's prosperity, however, continued to depend on plantations worked by labor &quot;indentured&quot; from the interior.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=40}}

From the 1920s to the 1960s, strong economic growth, abundant natural resources and development of infrastructure, led to the arrival of even more Portuguese settlers.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} [[Petroleum]] was known to exist as early as the mid-19th century,{{sfn|Baynes|1878|p=45}} but modern exploitation didn't begin until in 1955. Production began in the [[Cuanza basin]] in the 1950s, in the [[Congo basin]] in the 1960s, and in the [[exclave]] of [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] in 1968. The [[Portuguese government]] granted operating rights for Block Zero to the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company, a subsidiary of [[ChevronTexaco]], in 1955.&lt;ref name=&quot;opec&quot;/&gt; Oil production surpassed the exportation of [[coffee]] as Angola's largest export in 1973.

A military-led coup d'état, started on April 25, 1974, in Lisbon, overthrew the [[Marcelo Caetano]] government in Portugal, and promised to hand over power to an independent Angolan government. [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], the [[President of Zaire]], met with [[António de Spínola]], the transitional [[President of Portugal]], on September 15, 1974, on [[Sal island]] in [[Cape Verde]], crafting a plan to empower [[Holden Roberto]] of the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]], [[Jonas Savimbi]] of [[UNITA]], and [[Daniel Chipenda]] of the [[MPLA]]'s eastern faction at the expense of MPLA leader [[Agostinho Neto]] while retaining the façade of national unity. Mobutu and Spínola wanted to present Chipenda as the MPLA head, Mobutu particularly preferring Chipenda over Neto because Chipenda supported autonomy for [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]]. The Angolan [[exclave]] has immense petroleum reserves estimated at around 300 million tons (~300{{e|9}}&amp;nbsp;kg) which Zaire, and thus the Mobutu government, depended on for economic survival.&lt;ref name=&quot;petroleum&quot;&gt;Erik P. Hoffmann and Frederic J. Fleron. ''The Conduct of Soviet Foreign Policy'', 1980. Page 524.&lt;/ref&gt; After independence thousands of white Portuguese left, most of them to [[Portugal]] and many travelling overland to [[South Africa]]. There was an immediate crisis because the indigenous African population lacked the skills and knowledge needed to run the country and maintain its well-developed infrastructure.

The Angolan government created [[Sonangol]], a state-run oil company, in 1976. Two years later Sonangol received the rights to oil exploration and production in all of Angola.&lt;ref name=&quot;opec&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Angola/pdf.pdf |format=PDF |title=Angola |work=Energy Information Administration |publisher=Eia.doe.gov |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926035705/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Angola/pdf.pdf |archivedate=September 26, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After independence from Portugal in 1975, Angola was ravaged by a horrific [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] between 1975 and 2002.

===1990s===
[[United Nations Angola Verification Mission III]] and [[MONUA]] spent [[USD]]1.5 billion overseeing implementation of the [[Lusaka Protocol]], a 1994 peace accord that ultimately failed to end the civil war. The protocol prohibited [[UNITA]] from buying foreign arms, a provision the [[United Nations]] largely did not enforce, so both sides continued to build up their stockpile. UNITA purchased weapons in 1996 and 1997 from private sources in [[Albania]] and [[Bulgaria]], and from [[Zaire]], [[South Africa]], [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Zambia]], [[Togo]], and [[Burkina Faso]]. In October 1997 the UN imposed travel sanctions on UNITA leaders, but the UN waited until July 1998 to limit UNITA's exportation of diamonds and freeze UNITA bank accounts. While the U.S. government gave USD250 million to UNITA between 1986 and 1991, UNITA made USD1.72 billion between 1994 and 1999 exporting diamonds, primarily through Zaire to Europe. At the same time the Angolan government received large amounts of weapons from the governments of [[Belarus]], [[Brazil]], Bulgaria, [[China]], and [[South Africa]]. While no arms shipment to the government violated the protocol, no country informed the U.N. Register on Conventional Weapons as required.&lt;ref name=&quot;lusaka&quot;&gt;Vines, Alex. ''Angola Unravels: The Rise and Fall of the Lusaka Peace Process'', 1999. Human Rights Watch.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the increase in civil warfare in late 1998, the economy grew by an estimated 4% in 1999. The government introduced new currency denominations in 1999, including a 1 and 5 kwanza note.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===2000s===
An economic reform effort was launched in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Angola ranked 160 of 174 nations in the [[United Nations Human Development Index]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;fastest&quot;/&gt; In April 2000 Angola started an [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) Staff-Monitored Program (SMP). The program formally lapsed in June 2001, but the IMF remains engaged. In this context the Government of Angola has succeeded in unifying exchange rates and has raised fuel, electricity, and water rates. The Commercial Code, telecommunications law, and Foreign Investment Code are being modernized. A privatization effort, prepared with [[World Bank]] assistance, has begun with the [[Banco de Comércio e Indústria|BCI]] bank. Nevertheless, a legacy of fiscal mismanagement and corruption persists.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} The civil war [[Internally displaced person|internally displaced]] 3.8 million people, 32% of the population, by 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;fastest&quot;/&gt; The security brought about by the 2002 peace settlement has led to the resettlement of 4 million displaced persons, thus resulting in large-scale increases in [[agriculture]] production.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Angola produced over {{convert|3|e6carat|kg|abbr=off}} of diamonds in 2003,&lt;ref name=&quot;threemct&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbendi.co.za/indy/ming/dmnd/af/p0005.htm |title=Diamond Mining in Africa - Overview |publisher=Mbendi.co.za |date=2014-03-31 |accessdate=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and production was expected to grow to {{convert|10|e6carat|kg|abbr=off}} per year by 2007.  In 2004 China's Eximbank approved a $2 billion line of credit to Angola to rebuild infrastructure.&lt;ref name=&quot;eximbank&quot;&gt;[http://www.iie-angola-us.org/full_headlines.php?id=440 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805192137/http://www.iie-angola-us.org/full_headlines.php?id=440 |date=August 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The economy grew 18% in 2005 and growth was expected to reach 26% in 2006 and stay above 10% for the rest of the decade.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

The construction industry is taking advantage of the growing economy, with various housing projects stimulated by the government initiatives for example the ''Angola Investe'' program and the ''[[Grupo Opaia SA#Casa Feliz|Casa Feliz]]'' or ''[[Grupo Opaia SA#Opaia Águas (Water)|Meña]]'' projects. Not all public construction projects are functional. A case in point: [[Kilamba Kiaxi]], where a whole new satellite town of Luanda, consisting of housing facilities for several hundreds of thousands of people, was completely uninhabited for over four years because of skyrocketing prices, but completely sold out after the government decreased the original price and created mortgage plans at around the election time thus made it affordable for middle-class people.
ChevronTexaco started pumping {{convert|50|koilbbl/d|abbr=on}} from Block 14 in January 2000, but production  decreased to {{convert|57|koilbbl/d|abbr=on}} in 2007 due to poor-quality oil.&lt;ref name=&quot;opec&quot;/&gt; Angola joined the [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]] on January 1, 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;opec&quot;/&gt;

==Overview==
{{See also|Agriculture in Angola|Fishing in Angola}}
[[Image:Africa by GDP, 2002.png|right|frame|National GDP per capita ranges from wealthier states in the north and south to poorer states in the east. These figures from the 2002 World Bank are converted to US dollars.]]
Despite its abundant natural resources, output per capita is among the world's lowest. Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 85% of the population. Oil production and the supporting activities are vital to the economy, contributing about 45% to GDP and 90% of exports. Growth is almost entirely driven by rising oil production which surpassed {{convert|1.4|Moilbbl/d}} in late-2005 and which is expected to grow to {{convert|2|Moilbbl/d}} by 2007. Control of the oil industry is consolidated in [[Sonangol Group]], a conglomerate owned by the Angolan government. With revenues booming from oil exports, the government has started to implement ambitious development programs to build roads and other basic infrastructure for the nation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

In the last decade of the colonial period, Angola was a major African food exporter but now imports almost all its food. Severe wartime conditions, including extensive planting of landmines throughout the countryside, have brought agricultural activities to a near-standstill. Some efforts to recover have gone forward, however, notably in fisheries. [[Coffee]] production, though a fraction of its pre-1975 level, is sufficient for domestic needs and some exports. Expanding oil production is now almost half of GDP and 90% of exports, at {{convert|800|koilbbl/d}}. Diamonds provided much of the revenue for [[Jonas Savimbi]]'s [[UNITA]] rebellion through illicit trade. Other rich resources await development: gold, forest products, fisheries, iron ore, coffee, and fruits.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Exports in 2004 reached [[United States dollar|US$]]10,530,764,911. The vast majority of Angola's exports, 92% in 2004, are petroleum products.

Angola produces and exports more petroleum than any other nation in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], surpassing [[Nigeria]] in the [[2000s in Angola|2000s]]. In January 2007 Angola became a member of [[OPEC]]. By 2010 production is expected to double the 2006 output level with development of deep-water offshore oil fields. Oil sales generated USD&amp;nbsp;1.71 billion in tax revenue in 2004 and now makes up 80% of the government's budget, a 5% increase from 2003, and 45% of [[GDP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oilview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;budgincrease&quot;&gt;OECD (2006). Page 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chevron Corporation]] produces and receives {{convert|400|koilbbl/d|abbr=on}}, 27% of Angolan oil. [[Total S.A.]], [[Chevron Corporation]], [[ExxonMobil]], [[Eni]], [[Petrobras]], and [[BP]] also operate in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;oilhistory&quot;/&gt;

Block Zero provides the majority of Angola's crude oil production&lt;ref name=&quot;zero&quot;&gt;OECD (2006). Page 132.&lt;/ref&gt; with {{convert|370|koilbbl/d|abbr=on}} produced annually&lt;!-- per day per year ...? --&gt;. The largest fields in Block Zero are Takula (Area A), Numbi (Area A), and Kokongo (Area B). Chevron operates in Block Zero with a 39.2% share. [[SONANGOL]], the state oil company, Total, and Eni own the rest of the block. Chevron also operates Angola's first producing deepwater section, Block 14, with {{convert|57|koilbbl/d|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;opec&quot;/&gt;

The [[United Nations]] has criticized the Angolan government for using torture, rape, summary executions, arbitrary detention, and disappearances, actions which Angolan government has justified on the need to maintain oil output.&lt;ref name=&quot;hroil&quot;&gt;Omeje, Kenneth C. ''High Stakes And Stakeholders: Oil Conflict And Security in Nigeria'', 2006. Page 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Angola is the third-largest trading partner of the United States in Sub-Saharan Africa, largely because of its petroleum exports.&lt;ref name=&quot;thirdlargest&quot;&gt;United States Congress. ''Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations for 1998: Hearings'', 1997. Page 269.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. imports 7% of its oil from Angola, about three times as much as it imported from [[Kuwait]] just prior to the [[Gulf War]] in 1991. The U.S. Government has invested USD $4 billion in Angola's petroleum sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;kuwait&quot;&gt;Vines, Alex. ''Angola Unravels: The Rise and Fall of the Lusaka Peace Process'', 1999. Human Rights Watch. Page 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oil makes up over 90% of Angola's exports.&lt;ref&gt;

===Diamonds===
{{Main|Mining in Angola}}
Angola is the third largest producer of diamonds in Africa and has only explored 40% of the diamond-rich territory within the country, but has had difficulty in attracting foreign investment because of corruption, human rights violations, and diamond smuggling.&lt;ref name=&quot;cfr&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200705071105.html|title=Angola: U.S. Must Strengthen Ties to Protect Strategic Energy and Security Interests|date=2007-05-07|work=Council on Foreign Relations (New York)|access-date=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production rose by 30% in 2006 and [[Endiama]], the national diamond company of Angola, expects production to increase by 8% in 2007 to 10 million carats annually. The government is trying to attract foreign companies to the [[Provinces of Angola|provinces]] of [[Bié (province)|Bié]], [[Malanje (province)|Malanje]] and [[Uíge Province|Uíge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;diaexploration&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The Angolan government loses $375 million annually from diamond smuggling. In 2003 the government began Operation Brilliant, an anti-smuggling investigation that arrested and deported 250,000 smugglers between 2003 and 2006. [[Rafael Marques (journalist)|Rafael Marques]], a journalist and human rights activist, described the diamond industry in his 2006 ''Angola's Deadly Diamonds'' report as plagued by &quot;murders, beatings, arbitrary detentions and other human rights violations.&quot; Marques called on foreign countries to boycott Angola's &quot;[[conflict diamonds]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;marques&quot;&gt;

The [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Department of Labor]] reported that &quot;there is little publicly available information on [Angola's] efforts to enforce child labor law&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/angola.htm 2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor - Angola -]&lt;/ref&gt; Diamonds accounted for 1.48% of Angolan exports in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;

===Iron===
{{Main|Mining in Angola}}
Under Portuguese rule, [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] began mining [[iron]] in 1957, producing 1.2 million tons in 1967 and 6.2 million tons by 1971. In the early 1970s, 70% of Portuguese Angola's iron exports went to [[Western Europe]] and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;diaexploration&quot;/&gt; After independence in 1975, the [[Angolan Civil War]] (1975–2002) destroyed most of the territory's mining infrastructure. The redevelopment of the Angolan mining industry started in the late 2000s.
