'''Apple Inc.''' is an American [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[technology company]] headquartered in [[Cupertino, California]] that designs, develops, and sells [[consumer electronics]], [[Software|computer software]], and online services. The company's [[computer hardware|hardware]] products include the [[iPhone]] smartphone, the [[iPad]] tablet computer, the [[Macintosh|Mac]] personal computer, the [[iPod]] portable media player, the [[Apple Watch]] smartwatch, the [[Apple TV]] digital media player, and the [[HomePod]] smart speaker. Apple's consumer software includes the [[macOS]] and [[iOS]] operating systems, the [[iTunes]] media player, the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] web browser, and the [[iLife]] and [[iWork]] creativity and productivity suites. Its online services include the [[iTunes Store]], the [[App Store (iOS)|iOS App Store]] and [[Mac App Store]], [[Apple Music]], and [[iCloud]].

Apple was founded by [[Steve Jobs]], [[Steve Wozniak]], and [[Ronald Wayne]] in April 1976 to develop and sell personal computers. It was incorporated as '''Apple Computer, Inc.''' in January 1977, and sales of its computers saw significant momentum and revenue growth for the company. Within a few years, they had hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line. Apple [[Initial public offering|went public]] in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative [[graphical user interface]]s, and Apple's marketing commercials for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price tag of its products and limited software titles caused problems, as did power struggles between executives at the company. Jobs resigned from Apple and created [[NeXT|his own company]]. As the market for personal computers increased, Apple's computers saw diminishing sales due to lower-priced products from competitors, in particular those offered with the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system. More executive job shuffles happened at Apple until then-CEO [[Gil Amelio]] in 1997 decided to buy Jobs' company to bring him back. Jobs regained position as CEO, and began a process to rebuild Apple's status, which included opening Apple's own [[Apple Store|retail stores]] in 2001, making numerous acquisitions of software companies to create a portfolio of software titles, and changed some of the hardware technology used in its computers. It again saw success and returned to profitability. In January 2007, Jobs announced that Apple Computer, Inc. would be renamed Apple Inc. to reflect its shifted focus toward consumer electronics and announced the [[iPhone]], which saw critical acclaim and significant financial success. In August 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health complications, and [[Tim Cook]] became the new CEO. Two months later, Jobs died, marking the end of an era for the company.

Apple is the [[List of the largest information technology companies|world's largest information technology company]] by revenue and the [[Mobile phone#By manufacturer|world's second-largest mobile phone manufacturer]] after [[Samsung]]. In February 2015, Apple became the first U.S. company to be valued at over [[United States dollar|US$]]700{{nbsp}}billion. The company employs 116,000 full-time employees {{as of|2016|10|lc=y}} and maintains 498 [[Apple Store|retail stores]] in 22 countries {{as of|2017|07|lc=y}}. It operates the iTunes Store, which is the world's largest music retailer. {{As of|2016|1}}, more than one billion Apple products are actively in use worldwide.

Apple's worldwide annual revenue totaled $215{{nbsp}}billion for the 2016 [[fiscal year]]. The company enjoys a high level of [[brand loyalty]] and has been repeatedly ranked as the world's most valuable brand. However, it [[Criticism of Apple Inc.|receives significant criticism]] regarding the labor practices of its contractors and its environmental and business practices, including the origins of source materials.

The [[Apple II series|Apple II]], also invented by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first [[West Coast Computer Faire]]. It differed from its major rivals, the [[TRS-80]] and [[Commodore PET]], because of its character cell-based color graphics and [[open architecture]]. While early Apple II models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5&amp;nbsp;¼&amp;nbsp;inch [[floppy disk]] drive and interface called the [[Disk II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple II History Chapter 4 |url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah04/ |author=Steven Weyhrich |date=April 21, 2002 |accessdate=August 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first &quot;[[killer application|killer app]]&quot; of the business world: [[VisiCalc]], a [[spreadsheet]] [[Computer program|program]].

By the end of 1970's, Apple had a staff of computer designers and a production line. The company introduced the [[Apple III]] in May 1980 in an attempt to compete with [[IBM]] and [[Microsoft]] in the business and corporate computing market.&lt;ref&gt;LEM Staff.

[[Xerox]] granted Apple engineers three days of access to the PARC facilities in return for the option to buy 100,000 shares (800,000 split-adjusted shares) of Apple at the pre-IPO price of $10 a share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2000/foth000918.htm |title=Fool.com: How Xerox Forfeited the PC War |work=The Motley Fool |last=Landley |first=Rob |date=September 18, 2000 |accessdate=August 12, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723144112/http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2000/foth000918.htm |archivedate=July 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface ([[Graphical user interface|GUI]]), and development of a GUI began for the [[Apple Lisa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Alex |last=Brooks |title=Apple at 30 – 1976 to 1986 |url=http://news.worldofapple.com/archives/2006/03/30/apple-at-30-1976-to-1986/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020204611/http://news.worldofapple.com/archives/2006/03/30/apple-at-30-1976-to-1986/ |website=World of Apple |date=March 30, 2006 |archivedate=October 20, 2008 |accessdate=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John C. |last=Abell |title=Jan. 19, 1983: Apple Gets Graphic With Lisa |url=https://www.wired.com/2010/01/0119apple-unveils-lisa/ |website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=January 19, 2010 |accessdate=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, however, he was pushed from the Lisa team due to infighting. Jobs took over Jef Raskin's low-cost-computer project, the [[Macintosh]]. A race broke out between the Lisa team and the Macintosh team over which product would ship first. Lisa won the race in 1983 and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a GUI, but was a commercial failure due to its high price tag and limited software titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemlisa&quot;&gt;Hormby, Thomas.

The machine's fortunes changed with the introduction of the [[LaserWriter]], the first [[PostScript]] [[laser printer]] to be sold at a reasonable price, and [[Adobe PageMaker|PageMaker]], an early [[desktop publishing]] package.

In 1985, a power struggle developed between Jobs and CEO [[John Sculley]], who had been hired two years earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemsculley&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Thomas Hormby |url=http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/john-sculley-years-apple.html |title=Growing Apple with the Macintosh: The Sculley years |website=Low End Mac |date=February 22, 2006 |accessdate=March 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Apple board of directors instructed Sculley to &quot;contain&quot; Jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at Apple. Sculley found out that Jobs had been attempting to organize a [[Coup d'état#Other uses of the term|coup]] and called a board meeting at which Apple's board of directors sided with Sculley and removed Jobs from his managerial duties.&lt;ref name=&quot;lem1985&quot; /&gt; Jobs resigned from Apple and founded [[NeXT|NeXT Inc.]] the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Spector |first=G |title=Apple's Jobs Starts New Firm, Targets Education Market |work=[[PC Week]] |page=109 |date=September 24, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Macintosh_portable.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Macintosh Portable]], released in 1989, was Apple's first battery-powered portable Macintosh personal computer.]]
After Jobs' departure, the Macintosh product line underwent a steady change of focus to higher price points, the so-called &quot;high-right policy&quot; named for the position on a chart of price vs. profits. Jobs had argued the company should produce products aimed at the consumer market and aimed for a $1000 price for the Macintosh, which they were unable to meet. Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher [[profit margin]], and appeared to have no effect on total sales as [[power user]]s snapped up every increase in power. Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, notably due to [[Jean-Louis Gassée]]'s mantra of &quot;fifty-five or die&quot;, referring to the 55% [[profit margin]]s of the [[Macintosh II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Carlton |first=Jim |year=1997 |title=Apple: The inside story of intrigue, egomania, and business blunders| publication-place = New York |publisher=Random House |pages=79–80 |isbn=0-8129-2851-2 |postscript=&lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This policy began to backfire in the last years of the decade as new desktop publishing programs appeared on [[IBM PC compatible|PC clones]] that offered some or much of the same functionality of the Macintosh but at far lower price points. The company lost its monopoly in this market, and had already estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their high-priced products. The Christmas season of 1989 was the first in the company's history that saw declining sales, and led to a 20% drop in Apple's stock price.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Carlton |first=Jim |year=1997 |title=Apple: The inside story of intrigue, egomania, and business blunders| publication-place = New York |publisher=Random House |pages=117–129 |isbn=0-8129-2851-2 |postscript=&lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gassée's objections were overruled, and he was forced from the company in 1990. Later that year, Apple introduced three lower cost models, the [[Macintosh Classic]], [[Macintosh LC]] and [[Macintosh IIsi]], all of which saw significant sales due to pent up demand.

In 1991, Apple introduced the [[PowerBook]], replacing the &quot;luggable&quot; [[Macintosh Portable]] with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops. The same year, Apple introduced [[System 7]], a major upgrade to the operating system which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities. It remained the architectural basis for the [[Classic Mac OS]]. The success of the PowerBook and other products brought increasing revenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemsculley&quot; /&gt; For some time, Apple was doing incredibly well, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process. The magazine ''[[MacLife|MacAddict]]'' named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the &quot;first golden age&quot; of the Macintosh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/stream/MacAddict-089-200401/MacAddict-089-200401-BobKiwi-v1_djvu.txt |title=MacAddict |issue=89 |date=January 2004 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple believed the [[Apple II series]] was too expensive to produce and took away sales from the low-end Macintosh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Timothy B. |last=Lee |title=The Five Most Expensive Apple Computers In History |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timothylee/2012/06/05/the-five-most-expensive-apple-computers-in-history/ |website=[[Forbes]] |date=June 5, 2012 |accessdate=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, Apple released the [[Macintosh LC]], and began efforts to promote that computer by advising developer technical support staff to recommend developing applications for Macintosh rather than Apple II, and authorizing salespersons to direct consumers towards Macintosh and away from Apple II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Apple IIGS, Cont. |url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah11.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912044443/http://apple2history.org/history/ah11.html |website=Apple II History |date=July 10, 2002 |archivedate=September 12, 2008 |accessdate=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Apple IIe]] was discontinued in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Benj |last=Edwards |title=30 years of the Apple Lisa and the Apple IIe |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/2025408/30-years-of-the-apple-lisa-and-the-apple-iie.html |website=[[Macworld]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=January 18, 2013 |accessdate=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of Apple's lower-cost consumer models, especially the LC, also led to cannibalization of their higher priced machines. To address this, management introduced several new brands, selling largely identical machines at different price points aimed at different markets. These were the high-end [[Macintosh Quadra|Quadra]], the mid-range [[Macintosh Centris|Centris]] line, and the ill-fated [[Macintosh Performa|Performa]] series. This led to significant market confusion, as customers did not understand the difference between models.&lt;ref name=&quot;vawperforma&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Macintosh Performa |url=http://www.vectronicsappleworld.com/profiles/performa.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419164519/http://www.vectronicsappleworld.com/profiles/performa.html |archivedate=April 19, 2013 |publisher=Vectronics Apple World |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple also experimented with a number of other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the 1990s, including [[Apple QuickTake|digital cameras]], [[PowerCD|portable CD audio players]], [[AppleDesign Powered Speakers|speakers]], [[Apple Bandai Pippin|video consoles]], the [[eWorld]] online service, and [[Apple Interactive Television Box|TV appliances]]. Enormous resources were also invested in the problem-plagued [[Newton (platform)|Newton division]] based on John Sculley's unrealistic market forecasts.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Ultimately, none of these products helped and Apple's market share and stock prices continued to slide.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Throughout this period, Microsoft continued to gain market share with [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] by focusing on delivering software to cheap commodity personal computers, while Apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Q4.06/3EC02E78-FD4D-4CDF-92A0-9C4CBDFAB3D2.html |title=1990–1995: Why the World Went Windows |accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response; instead, they sued Microsoft for using a GUI similar to the [[Apple Lisa]] in ''[[Apple Computer, Inc. v.

[[File:Newton-IMG 0320 cleanup.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Newton (platform)|Newton]] was Apple's first foray into the [[personal digital assistant|PDA]] markets, as well as one of the first in the industry. Despite being a financial flop at the time of its release, it helped pave the way for the [[PalmPilot]] and Apple's own [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]] in the future.]]

By the early 1990s, Apple was developing alternative platforms to the Macintosh, such as [[A/UX]]. The Macintosh platform itself was becoming outdated because it was not built for multitasking and because several important software routines were programmed directly into the hardware. In addition, Apple was facing competition from [[OS/2]] and [[UNIX]] vendors such as [[Sun Microsystems]]. The Macintosh would need to be replaced by a new platform or reworked to run on more powerful hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/B8DA34A3-333B-4204-BDF3-E74608998702.html |title=1990–1995: Hitting the Wall |accessdate=August 14, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924063130/http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/B8DA34A3-333B-4204-BDF3-E74608998702.html |archivedate=September 24, 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Apple allied with [[IBM]] and [[Motorola]] in the [[AIM alliance]] with the goal of creating a new computing platform (the [[PowerPC Reference Platform]]), which would use IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter Microsoft. The same year, Apple introduced the [[Power Macintosh]], the first of many Apple computers to use Motorola's [[PowerPC]] processor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apple-history.com/body.php?page=gallery&amp;model=6100&amp;performa=off&amp;sort=date&amp;order=ASC&amp;range= |title=Power Macintosh 6100 |accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple's success during this period was evident in its stock price. Between early 2003 and 2006, the price of Apple's stock increased more than tenfold, from around $6 per share (split-adjusted) to over $80.

A patent filed in July 2013 revealed the development of a new iPhone battery system that uses location data in combination with data on the user's habits to moderate the handsets power settings accordingly. Apple is working towards a power management system that will provide features such as the ability of the iPhone to estimate the length of time a user will be away from a power source to modify energy usage and a detection function that adjusts the charging rate to best suit the type of power source that is being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Darrell |last=Etherington |title=Apple Working On Location-Aware Battery Management For iPhone |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/25/apple-working-on-location-aware-battery-management-for-iphone/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=July 25, 2013 |accessdate=June 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 2014 interview, Apple designer [[Jonathan Ive]] used the iPhone as an example of Apple's ethos of creating high-quality, life-changing products. He explained that the phones are comparatively expensive due to the intensive effort that is used to make them:

{{quote|text=We don't take so long and make the way we make for fiscal reasons ... Quite the reverse. The body is made from a single piece of machined aluminium ... The whole thing is polished first to a mirror finish and then is very finely textured, except for the Apple logo. The chamfers [smoothed-off edges] are cut with diamond-tipped cutters. The cutters don't usually last very long, so we had to figure out a way of mass-manufacturing long-lasting ones. The camera cover is sapphire crystal. Look at the details around the SIM-card slot.

===Apple TV===
{{Main article|Apple TV}}

At the 2007 Macworld conference, Jobs demonstrated the [[Apple TV]] (previously known as the iTV),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/sep/12itunes7.html |title=Apple Announces iTunes 7 with Amazing New Features |publisher=Apple.com |date=September 12, 2006 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a set-top video device intended to bridge the sale of content from iTunes with high-definition televisions. The device links up to a user's TV and syncs, either via Wi-Fi or a wired network, with one computer's iTunes library and streams content from an additional four. The Apple TV originally incorporated a 40&amp;nbsp;GB hard drive for storage, included outputs for [[HDMI]] and [[component video]], and played video at a maximum resolution of [[720p]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/01/09appletv.html |title=Apple TV Coming to Your Living Room |publisher=Apple.com |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 31, 2007, a 160 GB hard disk drive was released alongside the existing 40&amp;nbsp;GB model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/05/30appletv.html |title=YouTube Coming to Apple TV |publisher=Apple.com |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A software update released on January 15, 2008, allowed media to be purchased directly from the Apple TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/15appletv.html |title=Apple Introduces New Apple TV Software &amp; Lowers Price to $229 |publisher=Apple.com |date=January 15, 2008 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, Apple discontinued the original 40 GB Apple TV and now continues to produce and sell the 160 GB Apple TV. On September 1, 2010, Apple released a completely redesigned Apple TV. The new device is 1/4 the size, runs quieter, and replaces the need for a hard drive with media streaming from any iTunes library on the network along with 8 GB of [[flash memory]] to [[cache (computing)|cache]] media downloaded. Like the iPad and the iPhone, Apple TV runs on an A4 processor. The memory included in the device is half of that in the [[iPhone 4]] at 256 MB; the same as the iPad, iPhone 3GS, third and fourth-generation [[iPod Touch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ross |last=Miller |title=Apple TV teardown reveals 8GB flash storage, 256MB RAM, leftover iPad parts |url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/09/29/apple-tv-teardown-reveals-8gb-flash-storage-256mb-ram/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=September 29, 2010 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has HDMI out as the only video out source. Features include access to the iTunes Store to rent movies and TV shows (purchasing has been discontinued), streaming from internet video sources, including [[YouTube]] and [[Netflix]], and media streaming from an iTunes library. Apple also reduced the price of the device to $99. A third generation of the device was introduced at an Apple event on March 7, 2012, with new features such as higher resolution (1080p) and a new user interface.

At the September 9, 2015, event, Apple unveiled an overhauled Apple TV, which now runs a variant of [[macOS]], called [[tvOS]], and contains 32GB or 64 GB of NAND Flash to store games, programs, and to cache the current media playing. The release also coincided with the opening of a separate Apple TV App Store and a new [[Siri Remote]] with a glass [[touchpad]], [[gyroscope]], and [[microphone]].

At the September 12, 2017 event, Apple released a new [[4K resolution|4K]] Apple TV with the same form factor as the 4th Generation model.  The 4K model is powered by the [[Apple A10X|A10X]] SoC designed in-house that also powers their second-generation iPad Pro. The 4K model also has support for [[high dynamic range]].

According to Steve Jobs, the company's name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a [[fruitarian]] diet. Jobs thought the name &quot;Apple&quot; was &quot;fun, spirited and not intimidating&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Steve Jobs bio says Apple CEO abhorred 'corrupt' execs |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/10/20/steve-jobs-bio.html |accessdate=October 21, 2011 |newspaper=CBC News |date=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple's first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts [[Sir Isaac Newton]] sitting under an apple tree. It was almost immediately replaced by [[Rob Janoff]]'s &quot;rainbow Apple&quot;, the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it. Janoff presented Jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the &quot;bitten&quot; logo, and Jobs immediately took a liking to it. However, Jobs insisted that the logo be colorized to humanize the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.wired.com/gadgets/mac/news/2003/09/60597 |title=Wired News: Apple Doin' the Logo-Motion |date=September 26, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zlok.net/blog/2009/03/29/i-invented-the-apple-logo/ |title=ZLOK Logo Design Blog: I Invented&amp;nbsp;... the Apple Logo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logo was designed with a bite so that it would not be confused with a cherry.&lt;ref name=&quot;creativebits_interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://creativebits.org/interview/interview_rob_janoff_designer_apple_logo |title=Interview with Rob Janoff, designer of the Apple logo |first=Ivan |last=Raszl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colored stripes were conceived to make the logo more accessible, and to represent the fact the Apple II could generate graphics in color.&lt;ref name=&quot;creativebits_interview&quot; /&gt; This logo is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to [[Alan Turing]], with the bite mark a reference to [[Alan Turing#Death|his method of suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/logos-that-became-legends-icons-from-the-world-of-advertising-768077.html |title=Logos that became legends: Icons from the world of advertising |location=UK |work=The Independent |accessdate=September 14, 2009 |date=January 4, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003003651/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/logos-that-became-legends-icons-from-the-world-of-advertising-768077.html |archivedate=October 3, 2009 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unisourcedesign.ca/en/archive_design_technology.html_1.html |title=Archived Interview with Rob Janoff |date=March 14, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050314132032/http://www.unisourcedesign.ca/en/archive_design_technology.html_1.html |archivedate=March 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Janoff and Apple deny any homage to Turing in the design of the logo.&lt;ref name=&quot;creativebits_interview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leavitt |first=David |title=The Man Who Knew Too Much; Alan Turing and the invention of the computer |year=2007 |page=280 |location=Phoenix |isbn=978-0-7538-2200-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple customers gained a reputation for devotion and loyalty early in the company's history. ''[[BYTE]]'' in 1984 stated that&lt;ref name=&quot;lemmons198412&quot;&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Lemmons |first=Phil |date=December 1984 |title=Apple and Its Personal Computers |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-12/1984_12_BYTE_09-13_Communications#page/n399/mode/2up |magazine=BYTE |page=A4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There are two kinds of people in the world: people who say Apple isn't just a company, it's a cause; and people who say Apple isn't a cause, it's just a company. Both groups are right. Nature has suspended the principle of noncontradiction where Apple is concerned.

Apple is more than just a company because its founding has some of the qualities of myth ... Apple is two guys in a garage undertaking the mission of bringing computing power, once reserved for big corporations, to ordinary individuals with ordinary budgets. The company's growth from two guys to a billion-dollar corporation exemplifies the [[American Dream]]. Even as a large corporation, Apple plays David to IBM's Goliath, and thus has the sympathetic role in that myth.}}

In response to a query about the devotion of loyal Apple consumers, Jonathan Ive responded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What people are responding to is much bigger than the object. They are responding to something rare—a group of people who do more than simply make something work, they make the very best products they possibly can. It's a demonstration against thoughtlessness and carelessness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Corporate culture===
[[File:Colleges with the most alumni at Apple.png|300px|frameless|right]]
Apple was one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of [[corporate culture]]. Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a [[Fortune 500]] company. By the time of the &quot;1984&quot; television commercial, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Deutschman |first=Alan |title=The once and future Steve Jobs |url=http://www.salon.com/technology/books/2000/10/11/jobs_excerpt/ |work=Salon.com |accessdate=November 22, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202183854/http://www.salon.com/technology/books/2000/10/11/jobs_excerpt/ |archivedate=December 2, 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2011 report in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]],'' this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fortune1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/25/how-apple-works-inside-the-worlds-biggest-startup |title=How Apple works: inside the world's largest startup |last=Lashinsky |first=Adam |publisher=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives, it has arguably lost some of its original character. Nonetheless, it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers, particularly after Jobs returned to the company. Numerous Apple employees have stated that projects without Jobs's involvement often took longer than projects with it.&lt;ref name=&quot;cultofmacwork&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cultofmac.com/what-its-like-to-work-at-apple |title=What It's Like To Work At Apple |first=John |last=Brownlee |date=July 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To recognize the best of its employees, Apple created the Apple Fellows program which awards individuals who make extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to [[personal computing]] while at the company. The Apple Fellowship has so far been awarded to individuals including [[Bill Atkinson]],&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzfeld&quot;&gt;[[Andy Hertzfeld|Hertzfeld, Andy]].

At Apple, employees are specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise. Jobs saw this as a means of having &quot;best-in-class&quot; employees in every role. For instance, [[Ron Johnson (businessman)|Ron Johnson]]—Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011—was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet had no control of the inventory in his stores (this was done by Cook, who had a background in supply-chain management).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Lashinsky |first=Adam |url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/25/how-apple-works-inside-the-worlds-biggest-startup/ |title=How Apple works: Inside the world's biggest startup – Fortune Tech |publisher=Tech.fortune.cnn.com |accessdate=December 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple is also known for strictly enforcing accountability. Each project has a &quot;directly responsible individual,&quot; or &quot;DRI&quot; in Apple jargon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fortune1&quot; /&gt; As an example, when iOS senior vice president [[Scott Forstall]] refused to sign Apple's official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned [[Apple Maps|Maps app]], he was forced to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lashinsky |first=Adam |title=Inside Apple's major shakeup |url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/10/29/inside-apples-major-shakeup/ |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=October 29, 2012 |accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other major U.S. companies Apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other CEOs like country club fees or private use of company aircraft. The company typically grants stock options to executives every other year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/apple-ceo-gets-modest-2012-pay-after-huge-2011-1.1092906 |title=Apple CEO gets modest 2012 pay after huge 2011 |date=December 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Apple had 110,000&amp;nbsp;full-time employees. This increased to 116,000&amp;nbsp;full-time employees the next year, a notable hiring decrease, largely due to its first revenue decline. Apple does not specify how many of its employees work in retail, though its 2014 [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] filing put the number at approximately half of its employee base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kif |last=Leswing |title=Apple added only 6,000 people last year — its slowest growth since 2009 |url=http://nordic.businessinsider.com/apple-hired-only-6000-people-fin-fy-2016-2016-10 |website=[[Business Insider]] |publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]] |date=October 27, 2016 |accessdate=May 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An editorial article in ''[[The Verge]]'' in September 2016 by technology journalist Thomas Ricker explored some of the public's perceived lack of innovation at Apple in recent years, specifically stating that Samsung has &quot;matched and even surpassed Apple in terms of smartphone industrial design&quot; and citing the belief that Apple is incapable of producing another breakthrough moment in technology with its products. He goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole, stating &quot;Yes, iteration is boring. But it's also how Apple does business. [...] It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success&quot;. He acknowledges that people are wishing for the &quot;excitement of revolution&quot;, but argues that people want &quot;the comfort that comes with harmony&quot;. Furthermore, he writes that &quot;a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned&quot;, referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem (specifically mentioning that [[Walkman]] didn't have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along), but how Apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the [[iCloud]] cloud service with features including Universal Clipboard (in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device) as well as inter-connected device functionality including Auto Unlock (in which an [[Apple Watch]] can unlock a [[Macintosh|Mac]] in close proximity). He argues that Apple's ecosystem is its greatest innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Thomas |last=Ricker |title=First Click: Apple's greatest innovation is its ecosystem |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12828846/apple-s-greatest-product-is-its-ecosystem |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=September 7, 2016 |accessdate=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple has a strong culture of [[corporate secrecy]], and has an anti-[[News leak|leak]] Global Security team that recruits from the [[National Security Agency]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and the [[United States Secret Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=William |last=Turton |title=Leaked recording: Inside Apple’s global war on leakers |url=https://theoutline.com/post/1766/leaked-recording-inside-apple-s-global-war-on-leakers |website=[[The Outline (website)|The Outline]] |date=June 20, 2017 |accessdate=June 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dani |last=Deahl |title=Internal Apple presentation on how to handle leaks gets leaked |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/20/15837522/apple-internal-presentation-leaks |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 20, 2017 |accessdate=June 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Benjamin |last=Mayo |title=Report details Apple’s efforts to increase product secrecy, more leaks from Apple campus than supply chain in 2016 |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/06/20/apple-product-secrecy-leaks-leaked-meeting/ |website=9to5Mac |date=June 20, 2017 |accessdate=June 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manufacturing===
The company's manufacturing, procurement and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories. In 2011, Apple's profit margins were 40 percent, compared with between 10 and 20 percent for most other hardware companies. Cook's catchphrase to describe his focus on the company's operational arm is: &quot;Nobody wants to buy sour milk&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;supply&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://business.financialpost.com/2011/11/09/ruthlessness-and-lasers-apples-supply-chain-revealed/ |title=Ruthlessness and lasers: Apple's supply chain revealed &amp;#124; Smart Shift &amp;#124; Executive &amp;#124; Financial Post |publisher=Business.financialpost.com |accessdate=December 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Mac's early history Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lawlor.cs.uaf.edu/~olawlor/ref/mac_ports/index.html |title=Mac Ports |publisher=Lawlor.cs.uaf.edu |date=March 17, 2001 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s, beginning with Apple's adoption of the [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] bus in the [[Power Macintosh 7500|7500]]/[[Power Macintosh 8500|8500]]/[[Power Macintosh 9500|9500]] [[Power Macintosh|Power Macs]]. Apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as [[USB]], [[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]], [[HyperTransport]], [[Wi-Fi]], [[NVM Express|NVMe]], [[PCI Express|PCIe]] and others in its products. [[FireWire]] is an Apple-originated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as [[IEEE 1394]] and is a legally mandated port in all Cable TV boxes in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1394ta.org/consumers/WhatIsFireWire.html |title=1394 Trade Association: What is 1394? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404152533/http://www.1394ta.org/consumers/WhatIsFireWire.html |archivedate=April 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple has gradually expanded its efforts in getting its products into the Indian market.

{{further information|Criticism of Apple Inc.#Labor practices}}
The company advertised its products as being made in America until the late 1990s; however, as a result of [[outsourcing]] initiatives in the 2000s, almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad. According to a report by ''[[The New York Times]]'', Apple insiders &quot;believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their American counterparts that &quot;Made in the U.S.A.&quot; is no longer a viable option for most Apple products&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html?pagewanted=all |work=The New York Times |first1=Charles |last1=Duhigg |first2=Keith |last2=Bradsher |title=Apple, America and a Squeezed Middle Class |date=January 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statement was released after the results from the company's probe into its suppliers' labor practices were published in early 2010.

A 2014 BBC investigation found excessive hours and other problems persisted, despite Apple's promise to reform factory practice after the 2010 Foxconn suicides. The Pegatron factory was once again the subject of review, as reporters gained access to the working conditions inside through recruitment as employees. While the BBC maintained that the experiences of its reporters showed that labor violations were continuing since 2010, Apple publicly disagreed with the BBC and stated: &quot;We are aware of no other company doing as much as Apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fire&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple under fire again for working conditions at Chinese factories |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/19/apple-under-fire-again-for-working-conditions-at-chinese-factories |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=December 19, 2014 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, the [[Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights]] published a report which documented inhumane conditions for the 15,000 workers at a Zhen Ding Technology factory in Shenzhen, China, which serves as a major supplier of circuit boards for Apple's iPhone and iPad. According to the report, workers are pressured into 65-hour work weeks which leaves them so exhausted that they often sleep during lunch breaks. They are also made to reside in &quot;primitive, dark and filthy dorms&quot; where they sleep &quot;on plywood, with six to ten workers in each crowded room.&quot; Omnipresent security personnel also routinely harass and beat the workers.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Jamieson (December 23, 2014).

In 2010, [[Climate Counts]], a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts Apple in their top category &quot;Striding&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climatecounts.org/scorecard_score.php?co=7 |title=Climate Counts scorecard |publisher=Climatecounts.org |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a &quot;stuck icon&quot;, adding that Apple at the time was &quot;a choice to avoid for the climate conscious consumer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;iwclimate&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/mac/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207601672 |title=Environmental Group Hits Apple}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2016}}, Apple states that 100% of its U.S. operations run on [[renewable energy]], 100% of Apple's [[data center]]s run on renewable energy and 93% of Apple's global operations run on renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/environment/ |title=Environment |website=Apple |language=en-US |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the facilities are connected to the local [[Electrical grid|grid]] which usually contains a mix of fossil and renewable sources, so Apple [[carbon offset]]s its electricity use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/24/business/energy-environment/as-energy-use-rises-corporations-turn-to-their-own-green-utility-sources.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129164413/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/24/business/energy-environment/as-energy-use-rises-corporations-turn-to-their-own-green-utility-sources.html |title=Apple Becomes a Green Energy Supplier, With Itself as Customer |first=Diane |last=Cardwell |date=August 23, 2016 |archivedate=November 29, 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=December 30, 2016 |deadurl=no |quote=clean power often does not flow directly to their facilities.

In May 2015, Greenpeace evaluated the state of the Green Internet and commended Apple on their environmental practices saying, &quot;Apple's commitment to renewable energy has helped set a new bar for the industry, illustrating in very concrete terms that a 100% renewable Internet is within its reach, and providing several models of intervention for other companies that want to build a sustainable Internet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/global-warming/click-clean/#report |title=ClickClean |website=Click Clean |accessdate=April 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an event on March 21, 2016, Apple provided a status update on its environmental initiative to be 100% renewable in all of its worldwide operations. [[Lisa P. Jackson]], Apple's vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives who reports directly to CEO, Tim Cook, announced that as of March 2016, 93% of Apple's worldwide operations are powered with renewable energy. Also featured was the company's efforts to use sustainable paper in their product packaging; 99% of all paper used by Apple in the product packaging comes from [[Post-consumer|post-consumer recycled]] paper or sustainably managed forests, as the company continues its move to all paper packaging for all of its products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Environmental_Responsibility_Report_2015.pdf |title=Apple Environmental Responsibility Report (2015) |date= |website= |publisher=Apple Inc. |accessdate=March 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Environmental_Responsibility_Report_2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Apple working in partnership with [[The Conservation Fund|Conservation Fund]], have preserved 36,000 acres of working forests in [[Maine]] and [[North Carolina]]. Another partnership announced is with the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] to preserve up to 1,000,000 acres of forests in China. Featured was the company's installation of a 40 [[Megawatt|MW]] [[Solar power|solar power plant]] in the [[Sichuan]] province of [[China]] that was tailor made to coexist with the indigenous yaks that eat hay produced on the land, by raising the panels to be several feet off of the ground so the yaks and their feed would be unharmed grazing beneath the array. This installation alone compensates for more than all of the energy used in Apple's Stores and Offices in the whole of China, negating the company's energy carbon footprint in the country. In [[Singapore]], Apple has worked with the Singaporean government to cover the rooftops of 800 buildings in the city-state with solar panels allowing Apple's Singapore operations to be run on 100% renewable energy. Liam was introduced to the world, an advanced robotic disassembler and sorter designed by Apple Engineers in California specifically for recycling outdated or broken iPhones.

Apple announced on August 16, 2016, that Lens Technology, one of its major suppliers in China, has committed to power all its [[glass production]] for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by 2018. The commitment is a large step in Apple's efforts to help manufacturers lower their carbon footprint in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.macrumors.com/2016/08/17/lens-technology-renewable-energy-apple/ |title=Supplier Lens Technology Commits to 100 Percent Renewable Energy for Apple Manufacturing |last=Sumra |first=Husain |accessdate=August 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple also announced that all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with [[UL (safety organization)|UL's]] Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The standard, which started in January 2015, certifies that all manufacturing waste is [[reuse]]d, [[Recycling|recycled]], [[compost]]ed, or converted into energy (when necessary). Since the program began, nearly, 140,000 metric tons of waste have been diverted from [[landfill]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2016/08/17Apple-Announces-Environmental-Progress-in-China-Applauds-Supplier-Commitment-to-Clean-Energy.html |title=Apple – Press Info – Apple Announces Environmental Progress in China &amp; Applauds Supplier Commitment to Clean Energy |website=www.apple.com |accessdate=August 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tax practices====
{{further information|Criticism of Apple Inc.#Tax practices}}

Apple has created subsidiaries in low-tax places such as [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[British Virgin Islands]] to cut the taxes it pays around the world. According to ''The New York Times,'' in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes. In the late 1980s Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the &quot;[[Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich]],&quot; which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Duhigg |first1=Charles |last2=Kocieniewski |first2=David |title=How Apple Sidesteps Billions in Taxes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/business/apples-tax-strategy-aims-at-low-tax-states-and-nations.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=April 29, 2012 |date=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[British Conservative Party]] Member of Parliament [[Charlie Elphicke]] published research on October 30, 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Watson |first=Roland |title=Foreign companies 'avoid billions in corporation tax' |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article3583772.ece |newspaper=The Times |date=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which showed that some multinational companies, including Apple Inc., were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK, but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent, well below standard [[corporation tax]]. He followed this research by calling on the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[George Osborne]] to force these multinationals, which also included [[Google]] and [[The Coca-Cola Company]], to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues. Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of UK tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ebrahimi |first=Helia |title=Foreign firms could owe UK £11bn in unpaid taxes |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/consumertips/tax/9652516/Foreign-firms-could-owe-UK-11bn-in-unpaid-taxes.html |newspaper=Telegraph |date=November 2, 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a matter of [[Public records|public record]] that Apple Inc. is the single largest taxpayer to the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]] of the [[United States|United States of America]] with an [[Tax rate|effective tax rate]] of approximately of 26% as of the Second Quarter of the Apple [[Fiscal year|Fiscal Year]] 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investor.apple.com |title=Apple – Investor Relations |website=investor.apple.com |accessdate=April 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Reuters]] reported that Apple had earnings abroad of $54.4{{nbsp}}billion which were untaxed by the [[IRS]] of the United States. Under U.S. tax law governed by the [[Tax law|IRC]], corporations don't pay income tax on overseas profits unless the profits are repatriated into the United States and as such Apple argues that to benefit its [[shareholder]]s it will leave it overseas until a repatriation holiday or comprehensive tax reform takes place in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Drawbaugh |first1=Kevin |last2=Temple-West |first2=Patrick |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/09/us-usa-tax-offshore-idUSBREA3729V20140409 |title=Untaxed U.S. corporate profits held overseas top $2.1 trillion: study |work=Reuters |accessdate=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/ |title=Apple Earnings Call |website=Apple |accessdate=April 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 30, 2016, after [[Investigation of Apple's transfer pricing arrangements with Ireland|a three-year investigation]] by the EU's competition commissioner that concluded that Apple received &quot;illegal state aid&quot; from Ireland, the EU ordered Apple to pay 13{{nbsp}}billion euros ($14.5{{nbsp}}billion), plus interest, in unpaid taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple 13 billion euros&quot;&gt;Kanter, James and Scott, Mark (August 30, 2016) [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/31/technology/apple-tax-eu-ireland.html Apple Must Pay Billions for Tax Breaks in Ireland, E.U. Orders] ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the commissioner found that Apple had benefitted from Irish Department of Revenue tax rulings that allowed it to split the profits recorded by Apple Sales International internally between its Irish branch and a stateless &quot;head office&quot; entity lacking employees or premises (permitted under Irish law until 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STATEMENT-16-2926_en.htm |title=European Commission – PRESS RELEASES – Press release – Statement by Commissioner Vestager on state aid decision that Ireland's tax benefits for Apple were illegal |website=europa.eu |accessdate=September 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chancellor of [[Austria]], [[Christian Kern]], put this decision into perspective by stating that &quot;every [[Vienna|Viennese]] cafe, every sausage stand pays more tax in Austria than a multinational corporation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/31/technology/apple-tax-eu-ireland.html Amazon and Starbucks pay less tax than sausage stall, says Austria] BBC News, September 2, 2016.

===Litigation===
{{main article|Apple Inc. litigation}}
Apple has been a participant in various legal proceedings and claims since it began operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Federal Court Cases Involving Apple, Inc. |url=https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/AllNaturesOfSuit/Apple%2C%20Inc./ |publisher=Docket Alarm, Inc. |accessdate=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Apple is known for and promotes itself as actively and aggressively enforcing its intellectual property interests. Some litigation examples include ''[[Apple v. Samsung]]'', ''[[Apple v. Microsoft]]'', ''[[Motorola Mobility v. Apple Inc.]]'', and ''[[Apple Corps v. Apple Computer]]''. Apple has also had to defend itself against charges on numerous occasions of violating intellectual property rights. Most have been dismissed in the courts as [[Shell corporation|shell companies]] known as [[patent troll]]s, with no evidence of actual use of [[patent]]s in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Mullin |title=Patent troll VirnetX wants jury to give it a half-billion dollars of Apple’s cash |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/01/virnetx-kicks-off-final-massive-patent-trolling-attempt-vs-apple/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=January 26, 2016 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, on December 21, 2016, Nokia announced that in the U.S. and Germany, it has filed a suit against Apple, claiming that the latter's products infringe on Nokia's patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jordan |last=Novet |title=Nokia sues Apple for patent infringement in the U.S. and Germany |url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/12/21/nokia-sues-apple-for-patent-infringement-in-the-u-s-and-germany/ |website=[[VentureBeat]] |date=December 21, 2016 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jon |last=Swartz |title=Nokia sues Apple for patent infringement |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2016/12/21/nokia-sues-apple-patent-infringement/95709378/ |website=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |date=December 21, 2016 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy stance===
Apple has made clear its stance on privacy and as such has made available Transparency Reports on the Governmental Requests it receives. Apple states plainly, &quot;On devices running [[iOS 8]] and later versions, your personal data is placed under the protection of your passcode.&lt;sup&gt;[[IPhone|[305]]]&lt;/sup&gt; For all devices running iOS 8 and later versions, Apple will not perform iOS data extractions in response to government search warrants because the files to be extracted are protected by an [[encryption key]] that is tied to the user's passcode, which Apple does not possess.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/privacy/transparency-reports/ |title=Privacy – Transparency Reports – Apple |website=Apple |accessdate=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its latest &quot;Who Has Your Back?&quot; report, once again the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) awarded Apple 5 out of 5 stars &quot;commend[ing] Apple for its strong stance regarding user rights, transparency, and privacy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-government-data-requests-2015 |title=Who Has Your Back?

Following media reports about [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], NSA's massive electronic [[Mass surveillance|surveillance program]], in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Apple. According to leaks of said program, Apple joined the PRISM program in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Glenn |last1=Greenwald |first2=Ewen |last2=MacAskill |title=NSA Prism program taps in to user data of Apple, Google and others |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=June 7, 2013 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charitable causes===

In November 2012, Apple donated $2.5{{nbsp}}million to the [[American Red Cross]] to aid relief efforts after [[Hurricane Sandy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Weintraub |first=Seth |title=Apple donates $2.5M to Hurricane Sandy relief |url=http://9to5mac.com/2012/11/09/apple-donates-2-5-million-to-hurricane-sandy-relief/ |publisher=9to5Mac |accessdate=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 14, 2016, Apple and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) announced that they have engaged in a partnership to, &quot;help protect life on our planet.&quot; Apple released a special page in the [[App Store (iOS)|iTunes App Store]], Apps for Earth. In the arrangement, Apple has committed that through April 24, WWF will receive 100% of the proceeds from the applications participating in the App Store via both the purchases of any paid apps and the In-App Purchases. Apple and WWF's Apps for Earth campaign raised more than $8{{nbsp}}million in total proceeds to support WWF's conservation work. WWF announced the results at WWDC 2016 in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/help-the-planet-one-app-at-a-time |title=Help the planet.
