The '''acre''' is a [[Units of measurement|unit]] of land area used in the [[Imperial units|imperial]] and [[United States customary units#Units of area|US customary]] systems. It is defined as the area of 1 [[Chain (unit)|chain]] by 1 [[furlong]] (66 by 660 [[Foot (unit)|feet]]), which is exactly equal to {{frac|1|640}} of a [[square mile]], 43,560 square feet, approximately 4,047&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or about 40% of a [[hectare]].

The international symbol of the acre is '''ac'''. The most commonly used acre today is the international acre. In the United States both the international acre and the US survey acre are in use, but differ by only two parts per million; see below. The most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land. One international acre is defined as exactly {{gaps|4,046.856|422|4}}&amp;nbsp;square metres.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

An acre was defined in the Middle Ages as the amount of land that could be [[plough]]ed in one day by a yoke of oxen.

==Description==
One acre equals 0.0015625&amp;nbsp;square miles, 4,840&amp;nbsp;square yards, 43,560 [[Square foot|square feet]]&lt;ref&gt;National Institute of Standards and Technology [http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Publications/upload/h4402_appenc.pdf (n.d.) General Tables of Units of Measurement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061126000000/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Publications/upload/h4402_appenc.pdf |date=26 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or about {{convert|4047|m2|ha|abbr=off|lk=on|sigfig=4}} (see below). While all modern variants of the acre contain 4,840&amp;nbsp;square yards, there are alternative definitions of a yard, so the exact size of an acre depends on which yard it is based. Originally, an acre was understood as a [[selion]] of land sized at forty [[Rod (unit)|perches]] (660&amp;nbsp;ft, or 1&amp;nbsp;[[furlong]]) long and four perches (66&amp;nbsp;ft) wide;&lt;ref name=&quot;Klein2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Klein|first=Herbert Arthur|title=The Science of Measurement: A Historical Survey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CrmuSiCFyikC&amp;pg=PA76|accessdate=29 June 2015|date=3 December 2012|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0-486-14497-9|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; this may have also been understood as an approximation of the amount of land a yoke of oxen could plough in one day. A [[square]] enclosing one acre is approximately 69.57&amp;nbsp;yards, or {{convert|208|ft|9|in|m|abbr=off}} on a side. As a unit of measure, an acre has no prescribed shape; any area of 43,560&amp;nbsp;square feet is an acre.

==Differences between international and US survey acres==
In the [[international yard and pound]] agreement of 1959 the United States and five countries of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] defined the international yard to be exactly 0.9144&amp;nbsp;metres.&lt;ref&gt;National Bureau of Standards. (1959). [http://geodesy.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/FedRegister/FRdoc59-5442.pdf Refinement of Values for the Yard and the Pound].&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the international acre is exactly {{gaps|4,046.856|422|4}}&amp;nbsp;square metres.

Both the international acre and the US survey acre contain {{frac|640}} of a square mile or 4,840&amp;nbsp;square yards, but alternative definitions of a yard are used (see [[Foot (unit)#Survey foot|survey foot]] and [[Yard#Conversions|survey yard]]), so the exact size of an acre depends upon which yard it is based. The US survey acre is about {{gaps|4,046.872|609|874|252}} square metres; its exact value ({{sfrac|4046|13,525,426|15,499,969}}&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is based on an inch defined by 1&amp;nbsp;metre = 39.37&amp;nbsp;inches exactly, as established by the [[Mendenhall Order]]. Surveyors in the United States use both international and survey feet, and consequently, both varieties of acre.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Geodetic Survey]], (January 1991), &quot;[http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/INFO/Policy/st_plane.html Policy of the National Geodetic Survey Concerning Units of Measure for the State Plane Coordinate System of 1983].&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the difference between the US survey acre and international acre is only about a quarter of the size of an A4 sheet of paper (0.016&amp;nbsp;square metres, 160 square centimetres or 24.8&amp;nbsp;square inches), it is usually not important which one is being discussed. Areas are seldom measured with sufficient accuracy for the different definitions to be detectable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acsm.net/_data/global/images/PDF%20Documents/ACSM/20110223ALTAACSMLandTitleSurveyStandard2011.pdf Minimum Standard Detail Requirements For ALTA/ACSM Land Title Surveys] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904215328/http://www.acsm.net/_data/global/images/PDF%20Documents/ACSM/20110223ALTAACSMLandTitleSurveyStandard2011.pdf |date=4 September 2013 }}. Federick, MD: American Congress on Surveying and Mapping. 2011. [The standard uses &quot;precision&quot; in a sense more typically used for &quot;accuracy&quot;; the stated maximum allowable &quot;precision&quot; (page 3) is 2&amp;nbsp;cm and 50 parts per million. An instrument consistently measuring 2&amp;nbsp;cm short would measure the area of a one international acre square, 63.614907&amp;nbsp;m on a side, as 4044.3&amp;nbsp;square metres, 2.6&amp;nbsp;square metres less than the true value, a far greater discrepancy than the difference between the international and survey acres.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Asia==
In India, residential plots are measured in [[cent (area)|cents]] or [[Decimal (unit)|decimal]], which is one hundredth of an acre, or {{convert|435.60|ft2|m2}}. In Sri Lanka the division of an acre into 160 [[Perch (unit)|perches]] or 4 [[Rood (measurement)|roods]] is common.&lt;ref name=&quot;courtofappeal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://http |title=SRI LANKA |publisher=webcache.googleusercontent.com |accessdate=14 February 2014 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114075411/http://http// |archivedate=14 January 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equivalence to other units of area==
1 international acre is equal to the following metric units:
*0.40468564224&amp;nbsp;hectare (A square with 100&amp;nbsp;m sides has an area of 1&amp;nbsp;hectare.)
*4,046.8564224&amp;nbsp;square metres

1 United States survey acre is equal to:
*0.404687261&amp;nbsp;hectare
*4,046.87261&amp;nbsp;square metres  (1 square kilometre is equal to 247.105 acres)

1&amp;nbsp;acre (both variants) is equal to the following customary units:
*66&amp;nbsp;feet × 660&amp;nbsp;feet (43,560 [[square foot|square feet]])
*10 square [[Chain (unit)|chains]] (1 chain = 66&amp;nbsp;feet = 22&amp;nbsp;yards = 4 rods = 100 [[link (unit)|links]])
*1&amp;nbsp;acre is approximately 208.71&amp;nbsp;feet × 208.71&amp;nbsp;feet (a square)
*4,840&amp;nbsp;square yards
*43,560 [[Square foot|square feet]]
*160 [[Perch (unit)|perches]]. A perch is equal to a square [[Rod (length)|rod]] (1 square rod is 0.00625&amp;nbsp;acre)
*4 [[Rood (measurement)|roods]]
*A furlong by a chain (furlong 220&amp;nbsp;yards, chain 22&amp;nbsp;yards)
*40 rods by 4 rods, 160 rods&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (historically fencing was often sold in 40 rod lengths{{citation needed|date=November 2012|note=&quot;in the USA only?&quot;}})
*{{frac|1|640}} (0.0015625) square mile (1&amp;nbsp;square mile is equal to 640&amp;nbsp;acres)

Perhaps the easiest way for US residents to envisage an acre is as a rectangle measuring 88&amp;nbsp;yards by 55&amp;nbsp;yards ({{frac|1|10}} of 880&amp;nbsp;yards by {{frac|1|16}} of 880&amp;nbsp;yards), about {{frac|9|10}} the size of a standard [[American football field]]. [[File:Acre superimposed over football fields.svg|frame|The area of one acre (red) superposed on an [[American football]] field (green) and [[association football]] (soccer) pitch (blue).]] To be more exact, one acre is 90.75% of a 100-yd-long by 53.33-yd-wide American football field (without the [[end zone]]s). The full field, including the end zones, covers about {{convert|1.32|acres|2|abbr=on}}.

For residents of other countries, the acre might be envisaged as approximately half of a 105-m-long by 68-m-wide [[Association football pitch|association football (soccer) pitch]].

It may also be remembered as 44,000&amp;nbsp;square feet, less 1%.

== Historical origin ==
{{Anthropic_Farm_Units}}
The word &quot;acre&quot; is derived from [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|''æcer''}} originally meaning &quot;open field&quot;, [[cognate]] to west coast Norwegian {{lang|nor|''ækre''}} and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] {{lang|sv|''åker''}}, [[German language|German]] {{lang|de|''Acker''}}, [[Dutch language|Dutch]] {{lang|nl|''akker''}}, [[Latin]] {{lang|la|''ager''}}, [[Sanskrit]] {{lang|sa|''ajr''}}, and [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|αγρός}} ({{lang|el-Latn|''agros''}}). In English, it was historically spelled ''[[wikt:aker|aker]]''.

The acre was roughly the amount of land tillable by a yoke of oxen in one day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/1769|title=acre, n.|encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary | date = December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This explains one definition as the area of a rectangle with sides of length one [[chain (length)|chain]] and one [[furlong]]. A long, narrow strip of land is more efficient to plough than a square plot, since the plough does not have to be turned so often. The word &quot;furlong&quot; itself derives from the fact that it is one [[Plough|furrow]] long.

Before the enactment of the [[metric system]], many countries in Europe used their own official acres. These were differently sized in different countries, for instance, the historical French acre was 4,221&amp;nbsp;square metres, whereas in [[Germany]] as many variants of &quot;acre&quot; existed as there were German states.

Statutory values for the acre were enacted in England, and subsequently, the United Kingdom, by acts of:
*[[Edward I of England|Edward I]]
*[[Edward III of England|Edward III]]
*[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]
*[[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]
*[[Queen Victoria]] – the British [[Weights and Measures Acts of 1878 to 1893|Weights and Measures Act]] of 1878 defined it as containing 4,840&amp;nbsp;square yards.

Historically, the size of farms and landed estates in the United Kingdom was usually expressed in acres (or acres, [[Rood (measurement)|rood]]s, and [[Perch (unit)|perches]]), even if the number of acres was so large that it might conveniently have been expressed in square miles. For example, a certain landowner might have been said to own 32,000&amp;nbsp;acres of land, not 50&amp;nbsp;square miles of land.

The acre is related to the square mile, with 640&amp;nbsp;acres making up one square mile. One mile is 5280&amp;nbsp;feet (1760&amp;nbsp;yards). In western Canada and the western United States, divisions of land area were typically based on the square mile, and fractions thereof. If the square mile is divided into quarters, each quarter has a side length of {{frac|1|2}} mile (880&amp;nbsp;yards) and is {{frac|1|4}} square mile in area, or 160&amp;nbsp;acres. These subunits would typically then again be divided into quarters, with each side being {{frac|1|4}} mile long, and being {{frac|1|16}} of a square mile in area, or 40&amp;nbsp;acres. In the United States, farmland was typically divided as such, and the phrase &quot;the back 40&quot; would refer to the 40-acre parcel to the back of the farm. Most of the [[Canadian Prairie Provinces]] and the US Midwest are on square-mile grids for surveying purposes.

==Legacy acres==
* '''Customary acre''' – The customary acre was a measure of roughly similar size to the acre described above, but it was subject to considerable local variation similar to the variation found in [[carucate]]s, [[virgate]]s, [[Oxgang|bovates]], nooks, and farundels. However, there were more ancient measures that were also farthingales. These may have been multiples of the customary acre, rather than the statute acre.
* '''Builder's acre''' – In US construction and real estate development, an area of 40,000&amp;nbsp;square feet. Used to simplify math and for marketing, it is nearly 10% smaller than a survey acre.
