In [[organic chemistry]], '''amines''' ({{IPAc-en|US|ə|ˈ|m|i:|n|,_|ˈ|æ|m|i|n}},&lt;ref&gt;{{AHDict|amine}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|UK|ə|ˈ|m|i:|n|,_|ˈ|æ|m|i|n|,_|ˈ|eɪ|m|i|n}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/amine |title=Amine definition and meaning |publisher=Collins English Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/amine |title=amine - definition of amine in English |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |date= |accessdate=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; are [[organic compound|compounds]] and [[functional group]]s that contain a [[base (chemistry)|basic]] [[nitrogen]] [[atom]] with a [[lone pair]]. Amines are formally [[derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] of [[ammonia]], wherein one or more [[hydrogen]] atoms have been replaced by a [[substituent]] such as an [[alkyl]] or [[aryl]] group&lt;ref&gt;{{McMurray3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; (these may respectively be called alkylamines and arylamines; amines in which both types of substituent are attached to one nitrogen atom may be called alkylarylamines). Important amines include [[amino acid]]s, [[biogenic amine]]s, [[trimethylamine]], and [[aniline]]; see [[:Category:Amines]] for a list of amines. [[Inorganic compound|Inorganic]] derivatives of [[ammonia]] are also called amines, such as [[chloramine]] (NClH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); see [[:Category:Inorganic amines]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

Compounds with a nitrogen atom attached to a [[carbonyl]] group, thus having the structure R–CO–NR′R″,&lt;!-- has a well-known carbonyl group to be written as C(=O)? --&gt; are called [[amide]]s and have different chemical properties from amines.

==Classes of amines==
&lt;!-- [[primary amine]] redirects to this section --&gt;
An aliphatic amine has no [[aromatic ring]] attached directly to the nitrogen atom. [[Aromatic amine]]s have the nitrogen atom connected to an [[aromatic]] ring as in the various [[aniline]]s. The aromatic ring decreases the [[base (chemistry)|alkalinity]] of the amine, depending on its substituents. The presence of an amine group strongly increases the reactivity of the aromatic ring, due to an electron-donating effect.

Amines are organized into four subcategories:

*'''Primary amines'''—Primary amines arise when one of three hydrogen atoms in ammonia is replaced by an [[alkyl]] or [[aromatic]]. Important primary alkyl amines include, [[methylamine]], most [[amino acid]]s,  and the [[buffering agent]] [[tris]], while primary aromatic amines include [[aniline]].
*'''Secondary amines'''—Secondary amines have two organic substituents (alkyl, aryl or both) bound to the nitrogen together with one hydrogen. Important representatives include [[dimethylamine]], while an example of an aromatic amine would be [[diphenylamine]].
*'''Tertiary amines'''—In tertiary amines, nitrogen has three organic substituents. Examples include [[trimethylamine]], which has a distinctively fishy smell, and [[EDTA]].
*'''Cyclic amines'''—[[Cyclic compound|Cyclic]] amines are either secondary or tertiary amines. Examples of cyclic amines include the 3-membered ring [[aziridine]] and the six-membered ring [[piperidine]]. ''N''-methylpiperidine and ''N''-phenylpiperidine are examples of cyclic tertiary amines.

It is also possible to have four organic substituents on the nitrogen. These species are not amines but are [[quaternary ammonium cation]]s and have a charged nitrogen center.  Quaternary ammonium salts exist with many kinds of anions.

==Naming conventions==
Amines are named in several ways. Typically, the compound is given the prefix &quot;amino-&quot; or the suffix: &quot;-amine&quot;. The prefix &quot;''N''-&quot; shows substitution on the nitrogen atom. An organic compound with multiple amino groups is called a diamine, triamine, tetraamine and so forth.

Systematic names for some common amines:
{| border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin:auto;&quot;
|-  style=&quot;vertical-align:top; text-align:center;&quot;
| Lower amines are named with the suffix ''-amine''.&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Methylamine.svg|100px]]&lt;br&gt;
'''methylamine'''
| Higher amines have the prefix ''amino'' as a functional group. IUPAC however does not recommend this convention {{fact|21070730|date=July 2017}}, but prefers the alkanamine form, e.g. pentan-2-amine. &lt;br&gt;

'''2-aminopentane'''&lt;br&gt;(or sometimes: ''pent-2-yl-amine'' or ''pentan-2-amine'')
|}

==Physical properties==
[[Hydrogen bonding]] significantly influences the properties of primary and secondary amines.&lt;ref&gt;{{RubberBible86th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the [[melting point]] and [[boiling point]]  of amines is higher than those of the corresponding [[phosphine]]s, but generally lower than those of the corresponding [[alcohol]]s and [[carboxylic acid]]s. For example, [[Methylamine|methyl]] and [[Ethylamine|ethyl]] amines are gases under standard conditions, whereas the corresponding [[Methanol|methyl]] and [[Ethanol|ethyl]] alcohols are liquids. Amines possess a characteristic ammonia smell, liquid amines have a distinctive &quot;fishy&quot; smell.

The nitrogen atom features a [[lone electron pair]] that can bind H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to form an [[ammonium ion]] R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The lone electron pair is represented in this article by a two dots above or next to the N. The water [[solubility]] of simple amines is enhanced by [[hydrogen bonding]] involving these lone electron pairs.  Typically salts of ammonium compounds exhibit the following order of solubility in water: primary ammonium ({{chem|RNH|3|+}}) &gt; secondary ammonium ({{chem|R|2|NH|2|+}}) &gt; tertiary ammonium (R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Small aliphatic amines display significant solubility in many [[solvent]]s, whereas those with large substituents are lipophilic. Aromatic amines, such as [[aniline]], have their lone pair electrons [[conjugated system|conjugated]] into the benzene ring, thus their tendency to engage in hydrogen bonding is diminished. Their boiling points are high and their solubility in water is low.

==Structure==
===Alkyl amines===
Alkyl amines characteristically feature tetrahedral nitrogen centers.  C-N-C and C-N-H angles approach the idealized angle of 109°.  C-N distances are slightly shorter than C-C distances.  The energy barrier for the [[nitrogen inversion]] of the stereocenter is about 7&amp;nbsp;[[kcal/mol]] for a trialkylamine. The interconversion has been compared to the inversion of an open umbrella into a strong wind.

Amines of the type NHRR′ and NRR′R″ are [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]]: the nitrogen center bears four substituents counting the lone pair. Because of the low barrier to inversion, amines of the type NHRR′ cannot be obtained in optical purity.  For chiral tertiary amines, NRR′R″ can only be resolved when the R, R′, and R″ groups are constrained in cyclic structures such as N-substituted [[aziridine]]s ([[quaternary ammonium salt]]s are resolvable).

|}

===Aromatic amines===
In aromatic amines (&quot;anilines&quot;), nitrogen is often nearly planar owing to conjugation of the lone pair with the aryl substituent.  The C-N distance is correspondingly shorter.  In aniline, the C-N distance is the same as the C-C distances.&lt;ref&gt;G. M. Wójcik &quot;Structural Chemistry of Anilines&quot; in Anilines (Patai's Chemistry of Functional Groups), S. Patai, Ed. 2007, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/9780470682531.pat0385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basicity==
Like ammonia, amines are [[base (chemistry)|bases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Basicity and complex formation|journal= Patai's Chemistry of Functional Groups|editor=S. Patai|year=1968||author=J. W. Smith||doi=10.1002/9780470771082.ch4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to alkali metal hydroxides, amines are weaker (see table for examples of [[conjugate acid]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values).

The basicity of amines depends on:
# The electronic properties of the substituents (alkyl groups enhance the basicity, aryl groups diminish it).
# The degree of solvation of the protonated amine, which includes [[steric hindrance]] by the groups on nitrogen.

===Electronic effects===
Owing to inductive effects, the basicity of an amine might be expected to increase with the number of alkyl groups on the amine.  Correlations are complicated owing to the effects of solvation which are opposite the trends for inductive effects. Solvation effects also dominate the basicity of aromatic amines (anilines). For anilines, the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen delocalises into the ring, resulting in decreased basicity.  Substituents on the aromatic ring, and their positions relative to the amine group, also affect basicity as seen in the table.

===Solvation effects===
Solvation significantly affects the basicity of amines.  N-H groups strongly interact with water, especially in ammonium ions. Consequently, the basicity of ammonia is enhanced by 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; by solvation. The intrinsic basicity of amines, i.e. the situation where solvation is unimportant, has been evaluated in the gas phase.  In the gas phase, amines exhibit the basicities predicted from the electron-releasing effects of the organic substituents.  Thus tertiary amines are more basic than secondary amines, which are more basic than primary amines, and finally ammonia is least basic.  The order of pK&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'s (basicities in water) does not follow this order.  Similarly aniline is more basic than ammonia in the gas phase, but ten thousand times less so in aqueous solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{March6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In aprotic polar solvents such as [[Dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]], [[Dimethylformamide|DMF]], and [[acetonitrile]]  the energy of solvation is not as high as in protic polar solvents like water and methanol.  For this reason, the basicity of amines in these aprotic solvents is almost solely governed by the electronic factors.

== Synthesis ==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Organic reaction]] --&gt;

===Alkylation===
The most industrially significant amines are prepared from ammonia by [[alkylation]] with alcohols:
:ROH + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → RNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
These reactions require catalysts, specialized apparatus, and additional purification measures since the selectivity can be problematic. The same amines can be prepared by treatment of [[haloalkanes]] with ammonia and amines:
:RX + 2 R′NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → RR′NH + [RR′NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]X
Such reactions, which are most useful for alkyl iodides and bromides, are rarely employed because the degree of alkylation is difficult to control.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1002/14356007.a02_001|chapter=Amines, Aliphatic|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2000|last1=Eller|first1=Karsten|last2=Henkes|first2=Erhard|last3=Rossbacher|first3=Roland|last4=Höke|first4=Hartmut|isbn=3527306730}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selectivity can be improved via the [[Delépine reaction]], although this is rarely employed on an industrial scale.

===Reductive routes===
Via the process of [[hydrogenation]], [[nitrile]]s are reduced to amines using hydrogen in the presence of a nickel catalyst. Reactions are sensitive to acidic or alkaline conditions, which can cause hydrolysis of the –CN group. LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is more commonly employed for the reduction of nitriles on the laboratory scale. Similarly, LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; reduces [[amide]]s to amines. Many amines are produced from aldehydes and ketones via [[reductive amination]], which can either proceed catalytically or stoichiometrically.

[[Aniline]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and its derivatives are prepared by reduction of the nitroaromatics. In industry, hydrogen is the preferred reductant, whereas, in the laboratory, tin and iron are often employed.

===Specialized methods===
Many laboratory methods exist for the preparation of amines, many of these methods being rather specialized.

==Reactions==

===Alkylation, acylation, and sulfonation===
Aside from their basicity, the dominant reactivity of amines is their [[nucleophilic acyl substitution|nucleophilicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{March4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most primary amines are good [[ligand]]s for metal ions to give [[coordination complex]]es. Amines are alkylated by alkyl halides. [[Acyl chloride]]s and [[Organic acid anhydride|acid anhydride]]s react with primary and secondary amines to form [[amide]]s (the &quot;[[Schotten–Baumann reaction]]&quot;).
[[File:Amide formation from amine.gif|center|Amide formation]]
Similarly, with sulfonyl chlorides, one obtains [[sulfonamide]]s. This transformation, known as the [[Hinsberg reaction]], is a chemical test for the presence of amines.

Because amines are basic, they neutralize [[acid]]s to form the corresponding [[ammonium salt]]s R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. When formed from carboxylic acids and primary and secondary amines, these salts thermally dehydrate to form the corresponding [[amide]]s.
:&lt;math chem title=&quot;Amine reaction with carboxylic acids&quot;&gt;
\ce{
\underbrace{H-\!\!\overset{\displaystyle R1 \atop |}{\underset{| \atop \displaystyle R2}N}\!\!\!\!:}_{amine} +
\underbrace{R3-\overset{\displaystyle O \atop \|}C-OH}_{carboxylic \atop acid} -&gt;
}\
\underbrace\ce{{H-\overset{\displaystyle R1 \atop |}{\underset{| \atop \displaystyle R2}{N+}}-H} + R3-COO^-}

\underbrace{\overset{\displaystyle R1 \atop |}{\underset{| \atop \displaystyle R2}N}\!\!-\overset{\displaystyle O \atop \|}C-R3}_{amide} +
\underbrace{H2O}_{water}
}&lt;/math&gt;

===Diazotization===
Amines react with [[nitrous acid]] to give diazonium salts. The alkyl diazonium salts are of little synthetic importance because they are too unstable. The most important members are derivatives of aromatic amines such as [[aniline]] (&quot;phenylamine&quot;) (A = aryl or naphthyl):

:&lt;ce&gt;{ANH2} + {HNO2} + HX -&gt; {AN+2X^-} + 2H2O&lt;/ce&gt;

Anilines and naphthylamines form more stable [[diazonium]] salts, which can be isolated in the crystalline form.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | title = β-Naphthylmercuric chloride | author = [[Alexander Nesmeyanov|A. N. Nesmajanow]] | collvol = 2 | collvolpages = 432 | year = 1943 | prep = cv2p0432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diazonium salts undergo a variety of useful transformations involving replacement of the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group with anions. For example, [[Copper(I) cyanide|cuprous cyanide]] gives the corresponding nitriles:

:&lt;ce&gt;{AN+2} + Y^- -&gt; {AY} + N2&lt;/ce&gt;

Aryldiazonium couple with electron-rich aromatic compounds such as a [[phenol]] to form [[azo compound]]s. Such reactions are widely applied to the production of dyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1002/14356007.a03_245|chapter=Azo Dyes|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2000|last1=Hunger|first1=Klaus|last2=Mischke|first2=Peter|last3=Rieper|first3=Wolfgang|last4=Raue|first4=Roderich|last5=Kunde|first5=Klaus|last6=Engel|first6=Aloys|isbn=3527306730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conversion to imines===
[[Alkylimino-de-oxo-bisubstitution|Imine formation]] is an important reaction. Primary amines react with [[ketone]]s and [[aldehyde]]s to form [[imine]]s. In the case of [[formaldehyde]] (R′&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;H), these products typically exist as cyclic [[trimer (chemistry)|trimers]].
: RNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + R′&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C{{=}}O → R′&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C{{=}}NR + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Reduction of these imines gives secondary amines:
: R′&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C{{=}}NR + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → R′&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH–NHR

Similarly, secondary amines react with ketones and aldehydes to form [[enamine]]s:
: R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH + R′(R″CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)C=O → R″CH{{=}}C(NR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)R′ + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

==Biological activity==
Amines are ubiquitous in biology. The breakdown of [[amino acid]]s releases amines, famously in the case of decaying fish which smell of [[trimethylamine]]. Many [[neurotransmitter]]s are amines, including [[epinephrine]], [[norepinephrine]], [[dopamine]], [[serotonin]], and [[histamine]]. [[Protonated]] [[amino group]]s ({{chem|–NH|3|+}}) are the most common positively charged moieties in [[protein]]s, specifically in the amino acid [[lysine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1006/jmbi.1997.1498|title=Adaptation of protein surfaces to subcellular location|year=1998|last1=Andrade|first1=Miguel A.|last2=O'Donoghue|first2=Seán I.|last3=Rost|first3=Burkhard|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|volume=276|issue=2|pages=517–25|pmid=9512720|citeseerx=10.1.1.32.3499}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anionic polymer [[DNA]] is typically bound to various amine-rich proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Nelson|first1= D.

==Application of amines==

===Dyes===
Primary aromatic amines are used as a starting material for the manufacture of [[azo dye]]s. It reacts with nitrous acid to form diazonium salt, which can undergo coupling reaction to form an azo compound. As azo-compounds are highly coloured, they are widely used in dyeing industries, such as:

* [[Methyl orange]]
* [[Direct brown 138]]
* [[Sunset yellow]] FCF
* [[Ponceau 4R|Ponceau]]

===Drugs===
Many drugs are designed to mimic or to interfere with the action of natural amine [[neurotransmitter]]s, exemplified by the amine drugs:
* [[Chlorpheniramine]] is an [[antihistamine]] that helps to relieve allergic disorders due to cold, hay fever, itchy skin, insect bites and stings.
* [[Chlorpromazine]] is a tranquilizer that sedates without inducing sleep. It is used to relieve anxiety, excitement, restlessness or even mental disorder.
* [[Ephedrine]] and [[phenylephrine]], as amine hydrochlorides, are used as decongestants.
* [[Amphetamine]], [[methamphetamine]], and [[methcathinone]] are psychostimulant amines that are listed as controlled substances by the US [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]].
* [[Amitriptyline]], [[imipramine]], [[lofepramine]] and [[clomipramine]] are [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s and tertiary amines.
* [[Nortriptyline]], [[desipramine]], and [[amoxapine]] are [[tricyclic antidepressants]] and secondary amines. (The tricyclics are grouped by the nature of the final amine group on the side chain.)
* [[Substituted tryptamine]]s and [[substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamine]]s are key basic structures for a large variety of [[psychedelic drug]]s.
* [[Opiate]] [[analgesic]]s such as [[morphine]], [[codeine]], and [[heroin]] are [[Tertiary (chemistry)|tertiary]] amines.

===Gas treatment===
Aqueous [[monoethanolamine]] (MEA), diglycolamine (DGA), [[diethanolamine]] (DEA), diisopropanolamine (DIPA) and [[N-methyl-diethanolamine|methyldiethanolamine]] (MDEA) are widely used industrially for removing [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) from natural gas and refinery process streams. They may also be used to remove CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from combustion gases and [[flue gas]]es and may have potential for abatement of [[greenhouse gas]]es. Related processes are known as [[Amine gas treating|sweetening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1002/14356007.a17_073|chapter=Natural Gas|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2000|last1=Hammer|first1=Georg|last2=Lübcke|first2=Torsten|last3=Kettner|first3=Roland|last4=Davis|first4=Robert N.|last5=Recknagel|first5=Herta|last6=Commichau|first6=Axel|last7=Neumann|first7=Hans-Joachim|last8=Paczynska-Lahme|first8=Barbara|isbn=3527306730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
Low molecular weight amines, such as [[ethylamine]], are toxic, and some are easily absorbed through the skin. Many higher molecular weight amines are, biologically, highly active.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}
