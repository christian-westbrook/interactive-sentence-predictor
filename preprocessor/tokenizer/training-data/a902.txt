In [[Norse mythology]], '''Ægir''' ([[Old Norse]] &quot;sea&quot;)&lt;ref name=LINDOW47&gt;Lindow (2001:47).&lt;/ref&gt; is a sea [[jötunn]] associated with the [[ocean]]. He is also known for being a friend of the [[Æsir|gods]] and hosting elaborate parties for them.

He is the namesake for the exoplanet previously known as [[Epsilon Eridani b]].

Ægir's servants are [[Fimafeng]] (killed by [[Loki]]) and [[Eldir]].

== Description ==
The ''[[Nafnaþulur]]'' attached to the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' list Ægir as a giant.&lt;ref name=FAULKES156&gt;Faulkes (1987:156)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Cleasby]] and [[Guðbrandur Vigfússon]] saw his name as pre-Norse, derived from an ancient Indo-European root.&lt;ref name=CLEASBYVIGFUSSON758&gt;Cleasby, Vigfússon (1957:[http://web.ff.cuni.cz/cgi-bin/uaa_slovnik/gmc_search_v3?cmd=viewthis&amp;id=cv:b0758:26 758]).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attestations ==
Both ''[[Hversu Noregr byggðist]]'' and [[Snorri Sturluson]] in ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'' state that Ægir is the same as the sea-giant '''Hlér''', who lives on the Hlésey (&quot;Hlér island&quot;, modern Danish ''[[Læsø]]''), and this is borne out by kennings.&lt;ref name=SIMEK151&gt;Simek (1993:151).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DEVRIES1251&gt;de Vries (1956:251).&lt;/ref&gt; Snorri uses his visiting the Æsir as the frame of that section of the [[Prose Edda]].

In ''[[Lokasenna]]'', Ægir hosts a party for the gods where he provides the ale brewed in an enormous pot or cauldron provided by [[Thor]] and [[Týr]]. The story of their obtaining the pot from the giant [[Hymir]] is told in ''[[Hymiskviða]]''.

The prose introduction to ''Lokasenna'' and Snorri's list of [[kenning]]s state that Ægir is also known as [[Gymir]], who is [[Gerðr]]'s father, but this is evidently an erroneous interpretation of kennings in which different giant-names are used interchangeably.&lt;ref name=SIMEK126&gt;Simek (1993:126).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
[[File:Ægir, ruler of the ocean.jpg|228px|right]]
According to ''Fundinn Noregr'', Ægir is a son of the giant [[Fornjót]]r, the king of ''&quot;Gotlandi, Kænlandi and Finnlandi&quot;'', and brother of [[Logi]] (&quot;fire&quot;) and [[Kári]] (&quot;wind&quot;).&lt;ref name=LINDOW48&gt;Lindow (2001:48).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ægir's wife is [[Rán]]. She is mother of the [[Nine Daughters of Ægir]]:
*Bára (or Dröfn, &quot;wave&quot;)
*Blóðughadda (&quot;the one with blood-red hair – the color of the waves after a naval battle&quot;)
*Bylgja (&quot;to billow&quot; or &quot;big wave&quot;)
*Dúfa (&quot;the pitching wave&quot;)
*Hefring (&quot;the surging wave&quot;)
*Himinglæva (&quot;the wave that reflects the light of the sky&quot;)
*Hrönn (&quot;the grasping wave&quot;)
*Kólga (&quot;the chilling wave&quot;)
*Unnr (or Uðr, &quot;wave&quot;)
