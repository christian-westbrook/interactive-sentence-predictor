The '''American Film Institute''' ('''AFI''') is an American film organization that educates filmmakers and honors the heritage of the [[History of cinema in the United States|motion picture arts in the United States]]. AFI is supported by private funding and public membership.

==Membership==
The institute is composed of leaders from the film, entertainment, business and academic communities. A board of trustees chaired by Sir [[Howard Stringer]] and a board of directors chaired by [[Robert A. Daly]] guide the organization, which is led by [[President]] and [[CEO]], [[film historian]] [[Bob Gazzale]] (as of October 2014). Prior leaders were founding director [[George Stevens, Jr.]] (from the organizations inception in 1967 until 1980) and [[Jean Picker Firstenberg]] (from 1980 to 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/about/bod.aspx|title=AFI Board of Trustees etc|publisher=American Film Institute|date=October 2014|accessdate=December 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The American Film Institute was founded by a 1965 presidential mandate announced in the [[White House Rose Garden|Rose Garden]] of the [[White House]] by [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] – to establish a national arts organization to preserve the legacy of [[American film]] heritage, educate the next generation of filmmakers and honor the artists and their work. Two years later, in 1967, AFI was established, supported by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] and the [[Ford Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviemaker.com/archives/moviemaking/directing/articles-directing/summer-2002-afi-3378/|title=AFI Conservatory: Still the Program of Choice|publisher=MovieMaker|date=June 21, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original 22-member [[Board of Trustees]] included actor [[Gregory Peck]] as chairman and actor [[Sidney Poitier]] as vice-chairman as well as director [[Francis Ford Coppola]],film historian  [[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]] and lobbyist [[Jack Valenti]] and other representatives from the arts and academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/175/gallery/jean-picker-firstenberg|title=Jean Picker Firstenberg|publisher=Mount Holyoke College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute established a training program for filmmakers known then as the Center for Advanced Film Studies. Also created in the early years were a repertory film exhibition program at the [[Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] and the [[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]] — a scholarly source for American film history. The institute moved to its current eight-acre [[Hollywood]] campus in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://variety.com/2007/film/awards/afi-s-departing-chief-looks-back-1117966388/|title=AFI’s departing chief looks back|publisher=Variety|date=June 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film training program grew into the [[AFI Conservatory]], an accredited graduate school.

AFI moved its presentation of first-run and &lt;!--SHOULD THIS BE AMATEUR?--&gt;[[auteur films]] from the [[Kennedy Center]] to the historic [[AFI Silver|AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural Center]], which now hosts two major film festivals – AFI FEST and AFI DOCS – making AFI the largest nonprofit film exhibitor in the world. AFI educates audiences and recognizes artistic excellence through its awards programs and [[AFI's 10 Top 10|10 Top 10 Lists]].
