With a population of 4,587,558 in the urban center &lt;small&gt;(2014)&lt;/small&gt; and 5,150,072 in [[Ankara Province|its province]] &lt;small&gt;(2015)&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;ref name=&quot;citypopulation1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkey: Major cities and provinces|url=http://citypopulation.de/Turkey-C20.html |publisher=citypopulation.de|accessdate=2015-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is Turkey's [[List of largest cities and second largest cities by country|second largest]] [[List of cities in Turkey|city]] after former imperial capital [[Istanbul]], having overtaken [[İzmir]]. The former Metropolitan archbishopric remains a triple [[titular see]] (Latin, Armenian Catholic and Orthodox).

Ankara was [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]]'s headquarters from 1920 and has been the capital of the Republic since the latter's founding in 1923, replacing Istanbul (once the Byzantine capital [[Constantinople]]) following the [[Defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire|fall of the Ottoman Empire]]. The [[Government of Turkey|government]] is a prominent employer, but Ankara is also an important commercial and industrial city, located at the center of Turkey's road and railway networks. The city gave its name to the [[Angora wool]] shorn from [[Angora rabbit]]s, the long-haired [[Angora goat]] (the source of [[mohair]]), and the [[Turkish Angora|Angora cat]]. The area is also known for its pears, honey and [[muscat (grape and wine)|muscat]] grapes. Although situated in one of the driest places of Turkey and surrounded mostly by steppe vegetation except for the forested areas on the southern periphery, Ankara can be considered a green city in terms of green areas per inhabitant, at {{convert|72|m2|0|abbr=off}} per head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ankara.bel.tr/AbbSayfalari/hizmet_birimleri/Cevre/kisi_basina_dusen_yesil_alan.aspx |title=Municipality of Ankara: Green areas per head |publisher=Ankara.bel.tr |date= |accessdate=29 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719022657/http://www.ankara.bel.tr/AbbSayfalari/hizmet_birimleri/Cevre/kisi_basina_dusen_yesil_alan.aspx |archivedate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ankara is a very old city with various [[Hittites|Hittite]], [[Phrygia]]n, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[archaeological site]]s. The historical center of town is a rocky hill rising {{convert|150|sp=us|m|ft|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} over the left bank of the Ankara Çayı, a tributary of the [[Sakarya River]], the classical Sangarius. The hill remains crowned by the ruins of the old citadel. Although few of its outworks have survived, there are well-preserved examples of  [[Roman architecture|Roman]] and [[Ottoman architecture]] throughout the city, the most remarkable being the 20&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} [[Augusteum|Temple of Augustus and Rome]] that boasts the [[Monumentum Ancyranum]], the inscription recording the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=40–41}}

{{anchor|Etymology}}

== Etymology and names ==
As with many ancient cities, Ankara has gone by several names over the ages. It has been identified with the [[Hittites|Hittite]] cult center ''Ankuwaš'',&lt;!--or Ankuwa, but not Ankuwash--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;qgmpff&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://socialscience.tjc.edu/mkho/fulbright/1998/turkey/turman3.htm |title=Judy Turman: Early Christianity in Turkey |publisher=Socialscience.tjc.edu |date= |accessdate=29 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021115072135/http://socialscience.tjc.edu/mkho/fulbright/1998/turkey/turman3.htm |archivedate=15 November 2002 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;xtxpyw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/seyahat/4407373_p.asp |title=Saffet Emre Tonguç: Ankara (Hürriyet Seyahat) |publisher=Hurriyet.com.tr |date=|accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this remains a matter of debate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gorny&quot;&gt;Gorny, Ronald L. &quot;Zippalanda and Ankuwa: The Geography of Central Anatolia in the Second Millennium B.C.&quot; ''The Journal of the American Oriental Society''. Vol. 117 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; In classical antiquity and during the medieval period, the city was known as ''Ánkyra'' ({{lang|grc|Ἄγκυρα}}, &lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit|literally}}&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;&quot;[[anchor]]&quot;) in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and ''Ancyra'' in [[Latin]]; the [[Galatian language|Galatian Celtic]] name was probably a similar variant. Following its annexation by the [[Seljuk Turks]] in 1073, the city became known in many European languages as ''Angora''; it was also known in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] as ''Engürü''.{{sfn|Baynes|1878|p=45}}{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=40–41}} The form &quot;Angora&quot; is preserved in the names of breeds of many different kinds of animals, and in the names of several locations in the US (see [[Angora (disambiguation)|Angora]]).

== History ==
{{Main article|History of Ankara|Timeline of Ankara}}
[[File:MuseumOfAnatolianCivilizationsHittiteArtifacts.jpg|thumb|[[Alaca Höyük bronze standards|Alaca Höyük bronze standard]] on display at the [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]], Ankara.]]

The region's history can be traced back to the [[Bronze Age]] [[Hattians|Hattic]] [[Hattic language|civilization]], which was succeeded in the 2nd millennium BC by the [[Hittites]], in the 10th century BC by the [[Phrygia]]ns, and later by the [[Lydia]]ns, [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]]ns, [[Greeks]], [[Galatia]]ns, [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], and [[Turkish people|Turks]] (the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] [[Sultanate of Rûm]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and finally republican [[Turkey]]).

===Ancient history===
The oldest settlements in and around the city center of Ankara belonged to the [[Hattians|Hattic]] [[Hattic language|civilization]] which existed during the [[Bronze Age]] and was gradually absorbed c. 2000–1700 BC by the [[Hittite language|Indo-European]] [[Hittites]]. The city grew significantly in size and importance under the [[Phrygia]]ns starting around 1000&amp;nbsp;BC, and experienced a large expansion following the mass migration from [[Gordium|Gordion]], (the capital of [[Phrygia]]), after an earthquake which severely damaged that city around that time. In Phrygian tradition, King [[Midas]] was venerated as the founder of Ancyra, but [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] mentions that the city was actually far older, which accords with present archaeological knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece, 1.4.1., &quot;Ancyra was actually older even than that.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;

Phrygian rule was succeeded first by [[Lydia]]n and later by [[Iran|Persia]]n rule, though the strongly Phrygian character of the peasantry remained, as evidenced by the gravestones of the much later Roman period. Persian sovereignty lasted until the Persians' defeat at the hands of [[Alexander the Great]] who conquered the city in 333 BC. Alexander came from [[Gordium|Gordion]] to Ankara and stayed in the city for a short period. After his death at [[Babylon]] in 323 BC and the subsequent division of his empire among his generals, Ankara and its environs fell into the share of [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]].

Another important expansion took place under the Greeks of [[Pontus (region)|Pontos]] who came there around 300 BC and developed the city as a trading center for the commerce of goods between the [[Black Sea]] ports and Crimea to the north; Assyria, Cyprus, and Lebanon to the south; and Georgia, Armenia and Persia to the east. By that time the city also took its name {{lang|grc|Ἄγκυρα}} (''Ánkyra'', meaning ''[[anchor]]'' in [[Ancient Greek]]) which, in slightly modified form, provides the modern name of ''Ankara''.

===Celtic history===
[[File:Dying gaul.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Dying Galatian]]'' was a famous statue commissioned some time between 230–220&amp;nbsp;BC by King [[Attalus I|Attalos I]] of [[Pergamon]] to honor his victory over the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Galatia]]ns in [[Anatolia]]. Roman marble copy of a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] work of the late 3rd century BC, at the [[Capitoline Museums]], Rome.]]

In 278 BC, the city, along with the rest of central Anatolia, was occupied by a [[Celts|Celt]]ic group, the [[Galatia]]ns, who were the first to make Ankara one of their main tribal centers, the headquarters of the [[Tectosages]] tribe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], xxxviii. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Other centers were [[Pessinus|Pessinos]], today's ''Balhisar'', for the [[Trocmi]] tribe, and [[Tavium]], to the east of Ankara, for the ''Tolstibogii'' tribe. The city was then known as ''Ancyra''. The Celtic element was probably relatively small in numbers; a warrior aristocracy which ruled over Phrygian-speaking peasants. However, the Celtic language continued to be spoken in Galatia for many centuries. At the end of the 4th century, [[Jerome|St. Jerome]], a native of Dalmatia, observed that the language spoken around Ankara was very similar to that being spoken in the northwest of the Roman world near [[Trier]].

===Roman history===
[[File:Galatia Map.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Ancyra was the capital of the [[Celts|Celt]]ic kingdom of [[Galatia]], and later of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province with the same name, after its conquest by [[Augustus]] in 25&amp;nbsp;BC.]]

The city was subsequently passed under the control of the [[Roman Empire]]. In 25 BC, Emperor [[Augustus]] raised it to the status of a ''[[polis]]'' and made it the capital city of the Roman province of [[Galatia (Roman province)|Galatia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TIB&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Belke|first=Klaus|title=Tabula Imperii Byzantini, Band 4: Galatien und Lykaonien|chapter=Ankyra|pages=126–130|location=Vienna|publisher=Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften|year=1984|language=German|isbn=978-3-7001-0634-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ankara is famous for the ''[[Monumentum Ancyranum]]'' (''Temple of Augustus and Rome'') which contains the official record of the ''Acts of Augustus'', known as the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'', an inscription cut in marble on the walls of this temple. The ruins of Ancyra still furnish today valuable [[relief|bas-relief]]s, inscriptions and other architectural fragments. Two other Galatian tribal centers, [[Tavium]] near [[Yozgat]], and [[Pessinus]] (Balhisar) to the west, near Sivrihisar, continued to be reasonably important settlements in the Roman period, but it was Ancyra that grew into a grand metropolis.

[[File:Res Gestae.jpg|thumb|The [[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|Res Gestae]] is the self-laudatory autobiography completed in 13 AD, just before his death, by the first [[Roman emperor]] [[Augustus]]. Most of the text is preserved in the [[Monumentum Ancyranum]].]]
[[File:AnkaraRomanBaths1.jpg|thumb|The [[Roman Baths of Ankara]] were constructed by the Roman emperor [[Caracalla]] (212–217) in honor of [[Asclepios]], the God of Medicine, and built around three principal rooms: the ''[[caldarium]]'' (hot bath), the ''[[tepidarium]]'' (warm bath) and the ''[[frigidarium]]'' (cold bath) in a typically laid-out {{convert|80|x|120|m|adj=on|abbr=off}} classical complex.]]

An estimated 200,000 people lived in Ancyra in good times during the Roman Empire, a far greater number than was to be the case from after the fall of the Roman Empire until the early 20th century. A small river, the [[Ankara River|Ankara Çayı]], ran through the center of the Roman town. It has now been covered and diverted, but it formed the northern boundary of the old town during the Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman periods. Çankaya, the rim of the majestic hill to the south of the present city center, stood well outside the Roman city, but may have been a summer resort. In the 19th century, the remains of at least one [[Roman villa]] or large house were still standing not far from where the Çankaya Presidential Residence stands today. To the west, the Roman city extended until the area of the Gençlik Park and Railway Station, while on the southern side of the hill, it may have extended downwards as far as the site presently occupied by [[Hacettepe University]]. It was thus a sizeable city by any standards and much larger than the Roman towns of [[Gaul]] or [[Britannia]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Ancyra's importance rested on the fact that it was the junction point where the roads in northern Anatolia running north-south and east-west intersected, giving it major strategic importance for Rome's eastern frontier.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIB&quot;/&gt; The great imperial road running east passed through Ankara and a succession of emperors and their armies came this way. They were not the only ones to use the Roman highway network, which was equally convenient for invaders. In the second half of the 3rd century, Ancyra was invaded in rapid succession by the [[Goths]] coming from the west (who rode far into the heart of [[Cappadocia]], taking slaves and pillaging) and later by the [[Arab people|Arab]]s. For about a decade, the town was one of the western outposts of one of Palmyrean empress [[Zenobia]] in the [[Syrian Desert]], who took advantage of a period of weakness and disorder in the Roman Empire to set up a short-lived state of her own.

The town was reincorporated into the Roman Empire under Emperor [[Aurelian]] in 272. The [[tetrarchy]], a system of multiple (up to four) emperors introduced by [[Diocletian]] (284–305), seems to have engaged in a substantial programme of rebuilding and of road construction from Ankara westwards to Germe and [[Dorylaeum]] (now [[Eskişehir]]).

In its heyday, Roman Ankara was a large market and trading center but it also functioned as a major administrative capital, where a high official ruled from the city's Praetorium, a large administrative palace or office. During the 3rd century, life in Ancyra, as in other Anatolian towns, seems to have become somewhat militarized in response to the invasions and instability of the town.

===Byzantine history===
The city is well known during the 4th century as a centre of Christian activity (see also [[#Ecclesiastical history|below]]), due to frequent imperial visits, and through the letters of the pagan scholar [[Libanius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TIB&quot;/&gt; Bishop [[Marcellus of Ancyra]] and [[Basil of Ancyra]] were active in the theological controversies of their day, and the city was the site of no less than three church synods in [[Synod of Ancyra|314]], in [[Synod of Ancyra (358)|358]], and in [[Synod of Ancyra (375)|375]], the latter two in favour of [[Arianism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TIB&quot;/&gt; The city was visited by Emperor [[Constans I]] ({{reign|337–350}}) in 347 and 350, [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] ({{reign|361–363}}) during his Persian campaign in 362, and Julian's successor [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]] ({{reign|363–364}}) in winter 363/364 (he entered his [[Roman consul|consulship]] while in the city). After Jovian's death soon after, [[Valentinian I]]({{reign|364–375}}) was acclaimed emperor at Ancyra, and in the next year his brother [[Valens]]({{reign|364–378}}) used Ancyra as his base against the usurper [[Procopius (usurper)|Procopius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TIB&quot;/&gt; When the province of Galatia was divided sometime in 396/99, Ancyra remained the civil capital of Galatia I, as well as its ecclesiastical centre ([[metropolitan see]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;TIB&quot;/&gt; Emperor [[Arcadius]] ({{reign|395–408}}) frequently used the city as his summer residence, and some information about the ecclesiastical affairs of the city during the early 5th century is found in the works of [[Palladius of Galatia]] and [[Nilus of Galatia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TIB&quot;/&gt;

In 479, the rebel [[Marcian (usurper)|Marcian]] attacked the city, without being able to capture it.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIB&quot;/&gt; In 610/11, [[Comentiolus (brother of Phocas)|Comentiolus]], brother of Emperor [[Phocas]] ({{reign|602–610}}), launched his own unsuccessful rebellion in the city against [[Heraclius]] ({{reign|610–641}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;TIB&quot;/&gt; Ten years later, in 620 or more likely 622, it was captured by the [[Sassanid Persia]]ns during the [[Byzantine–Sassanid War of 602–628]]. Although the city returned to Byzantine hands after the end of the war, the Persian presence left traces in the city's archaeology, and likely began the process of its transformation from a [[late antique]] city to a medieval fortified settlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIB&quot;/&gt;

In 654, the city was captured for the first time by the [[Arabs]] of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], under [[Muawiyah]], the future founder of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TIB&quot;/&gt; At about the same time, the [[theme (Byzantine district)|theme]]s were established in Anatolia, and Ancyra became capital of the [[Opsician Theme]], which was the largest and most important theme until it was split up under Emperor [[Constantine V]] ({{reign|741–775}}); Ancyra then became the capital of the new [[Bucellarian Theme]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TIB&quot;/&gt; The city was attacked without success by [[Abbasid]] forces in 776 and in 798/99. In 805, Emperor [[Nikephoros I]] ({{reign|802–811}}) strengthened its fortifications, a fact which probably saved it from sack during the [[Abbasid invasion of Asia Minor (806)|large-scale invasion]] of Anatolia by Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] in the next year.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIB&quot;/&gt; Arab sources report that Harun and his successor [[al-Ma'mun]] ({{reign|813–833}}) took the city, but this information is later invention. In 838, however, during the [[Sack of Amorium|Amorium campaign]], the armies of Caliph [[al-Mu'tasim]] ({{reign|833–842}}) converged and met at the city; abandoned by its inhabitants, Ancara was razed to the ground, before the Arab armies went on to besiege and destroy [[Amorium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TIB&quot;/&gt; In 859, Emperor [[Michael III]] ({{reign|842–867}}) came to the city during a campaign against the Arabs, and ordered its fortifications restored.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIB&quot;/&gt; In 872, the city was menaced, but not taken, by the [[Paulicians]] under [[Chrysocheir]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TIB&quot;/&gt; The last Arab raid to reach the city was undertaken in 931, by the Abbasid governor of [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]], [[Thamal al-Dulafi]], but the city again was not captured.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIB&quot;/&gt;

=== Turkic rulers ===

After the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, the [[Seljuk Turks]] overran much of Anatolia. By 1073, the Turkish settlers had reached the vicinity of Ancyra, and the city was captured shortly after, at the latest by the time of the rebellion of [[Nikephoros Melissenos]] in 1081.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIB&quot;/&gt; In 1101, when the [[Crusade of 1101|Crusade]] under [[Raymond IV of Toulouse]] arrived, the city had been under [[Danishmend]] control for some time. The Crusaders captured the city, and handed it over to the Byzantine emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] ({{reign|1081–1118}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;TIB&quot;/&gt; Byzantine rule did not last long, and the city was captured by the Seljuk [[Sultanate of Rum]] at some unknown point; in 1127, it returned to Danishmend control until 1143, when the Seljuks of Rum retook it.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIB&quot;/&gt;

After the [[Battle of Köse Dağ]] in 1243, in which the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] defeated the Seljuks, most of Anatolia became part of the dominion of the Mongols. Taking advantage of Seljuk decline, a semi-religious cast of craftsmen and trade people named ''[[Ahis|Ahiler]]'' chose Ankara as their independent city-state in 1290. [[Orhan I]], the second [[Bey]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], captured the city in 1356. [[Timur]] defeated [[Bayezid I]] at the [[Battle of Ankara]] in 1402 and took the city, but in 1403 Ankara was again under Ottoman control.

The [[Levant Company]] maintained a factory in the town from 1639 to 1768.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=40–41}} In the 19th century, its population was estimated at 20,000 to 60,000.{{sfn|Baynes|1878|p=45}} It was sacked by [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egyptian]]s under [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] in 1832.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=40–41}} Prior to [[World War I]], the town had a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[consul (representative)|consulate]] and a population of around 28,000, roughly ⅓ of whom were Christian.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=40–41}}

=== Turkish republican capital ===

Following the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] defeat at [[World War I]], the Ottoman capital [[Constantinople]] (modern Istanbul) and much of [[Anatolia]] were occupied by the Allies, who planned to share these lands between [[First Republic of Armenia|Armenia]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], leaving for the Turks the core piece of land in central Anatolia. In response, the leader of the Turkish nationalist movement, [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], established the headquarters of his [[Turkish National Movement|resistance movement]] in Ankara in 1920. After the [[Turkish War of Independence]] was won and the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] was superseded by the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], the Turkish nationalists replaced the Ottoman Empire with the [[Republic of Turkey]] on 29 October 1923. A few days earlier, Ankara had officially replaced Constantinople as the new Turkish capital city, on 13 October 1923.

After Ankara became the capital of the newly founded Republic of Turkey, new development divided the city into an old section, called ''Ulus'', and a new section, called ''Yenişehir''. Ancient buildings reflecting Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman history and narrow winding streets mark the old section. The new section, now centered on [[Kızılay Meydanı|Kızılay Square]], has the trappings of a more modern city: wide streets, hotels, theaters, shopping malls, and high-rises. Government offices and foreign embassies are also located in the new section. Ankara has experienced a phenomenal growth since it was made Turkey's capital in 1923, when it was &quot;a small town of no importance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Columbia Lippincott Gazetteer&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, the year after the government had moved there, Ankara had about 35,000 residents. By 1927 there were 44,553 residents and by 1950 the population had grown to 286,781. Ankara continued to grow rapidly during the latter half of the 20th century and eventually outranked [[Izmir]] as Turkey's second largest city, after [[Istanbul]]. Ankara's urban population reached 4,587,558 in 2014, while the population of [[Ankara Province]] reached 5,150,072 in 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;citypopulation1&quot;/&gt;

== Ecclesiastical history ==
Early Christian martyrs of Ancyra, about whom little is known, included Proklos and Hilarios who were natives of the otherwise unknown nearby village of Kallippi, and suffered repression under the emperor [[Trajan]] (98–117). In the 280s we hear of Philumenos, a Christian corn merchant from southern Anatolia, being captured and martyred in Ankara, and Eustathius.

[[File:Teodot Ankirski.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Theodotus of Ancyra (martyr)|St. Theodotus of Ancyra]]]]
As in other Roman towns, the reign of [[Diocletian]] marked the culmination of the persecution of the Christians. In 303, Ancyra was one of the towns where the co-Emperors Diocletian and his deputy [[Galerius]] launched their anti-Christian persecution. In Ancyra, their first target was the 38-year-old Bishop of the town, whose name was Clement. Clement's life describes how he was taken to Rome, then sent back, and forced to undergo many interrogations and hardship before he, and his brother, and various companions were put to death. The remains of the church of [[Clement of Ancyra|St. Clement]] can be found today in a building just off Işıklar Caddesi in the Ulus district. Quite possibly this marks the site where Clement was originally buried. Four years later, a doctor of the town named Plato and his brother Antiochus also became celebrated martyrs under Galerius. [[Theodotus of Ancyra (martyr)|Theodotus of Ancyra]] is also venerated as a saint.

However, the persecution proved unsuccessful and in 314 Ancyra was the center of [[Synod of Ancyra|an important council]] of the [[Early Christianity|early church]];{{sfn|Rockwell|1911}} its 25 disciplinary canons constitute one of the most important documents in the early history of the administration of the [[Confession (religion)|Sacrament of Penance]].{{sfn|Rockwell|1911}} The synod also considered ecclesiastical policy for the reconstruction of the [[Christian Church]] after the persecutions, and in particular the treatment of ''[[Lapsi (Christianity)|lapsi]]''—Christians who had given in to forced [[paganism]] (sacrifices) to avoid [[martyrdom]] during these persecutions.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911}}
[[File:AnkaraColumnFar c.JPG|thumb|upright|The ''Column of Julian'' (362) was erected in honor of the Roman emperor [[Julian the Apostate]]'s visit to Ancyra.]]

Though paganism was probably tottering in Ancyra in Clement's day, it may still have been the majority religion. Twenty years later, Christianity and [[monotheism]] had taken its place. Ancyra quickly turned into a Christian city, with a life dominated by monks and priests and theological disputes. The town council or senate gave way to the bishop as the main local figurehead. During the middle of the 4th century, Ancyra was involved in the complex theological disputes over the nature of Christ, and a form of [[Arianism]] seems to have originated there.{{sfn|Parvis|2006|pp=325–345}}

In 362–363, the Emperor Julian passed through Ancyra on his way to an ill-fated campaign against the Persians, and according to Christian sources, engaged in a persecution of various holy men.&lt;ref name=gibbon&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibbon|first=Edward|title=[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]|authorlink=Edward Gibbon|page=Chapter 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stone base for a statue, with an inscription describing Julian as &quot;Lord of the whole world from the British Ocean to the barbarian nations&quot;, can still be seen, built into the eastern side of the inner circuit of the walls of Ankara Castle. The Column of Julian which was erected in honor of the emperor's visit to the city in 362 still stands today. In 375, Arian bishops met at Ancyra and deposed several bishops, among them [[Gregory of Nyssa|St. Gregory of Nyssa]].

In the late 4th century, Ancyra became something of an imperial [[resort|holiday resort]]. After [[Constantinople]] became the [[Byzantine Empire|East Roman]] capital, emperors in the 4th and 5th centuries would retire from the humid summer weather on the [[Bosphorus|Bosporus]] to the drier mountain atmosphere of Ancyra. [[Theodosius II]] (408–450) kept his court in Ancyra in the summers. Laws issued in Ancyra testify to the time they spent there.

The [[Metropolis of Ancyra]] continued to be a residential [[episcopal see|see]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] until the 20th century, with about 40,000 faithful, mostly Turkish-speaking, but that situation ended as a result of the 1923 [[Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations]]. The earlier [[Armenian Genocide]] put an end to the residential eparchy of Ancyra of the [[Armenian Catholic Church]], which had been established in 1850.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bull Universi Dominici gregis&quot;&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k51627x/f401.image Bull ''Universi Dominici gregis''], in Giovanni Domenico Mansi, ''Sacrorum Conciliorum Nova et Amplissima Collectio'', vol.

II, Paris 1914, coll. 1543–1546&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a titular metropolis of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]].

Both the Ancient Byzantine Metropolitan archbishopric and the 'modern' Armenian eparchy are now listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as [[titular see]]s,&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 832&lt;/ref&gt; with separate [[apostolic succession]]s.

=== Armenian Catholic (titular) see ===
In 1735 an [[Armenian Catholic]] diocese was established (Curiate Italian: ''Ancira degli Ameni''). Having fallen into disuse, on 1850.04.30 it was restored.

The 1915–1918 [[Armenian Genocide]] put an effective end to the residential diocese,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bull Universi Dominici gregis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gallica.bnf.fr&quot;/&gt; which was only formally  suppressed in 1972 and instantly transformed into an Armenian Catholic [[titular bishopric]]. The titular see has had a single occupant:
* Mikail Nersès Sétian (1981.07.03 – death 2002.09.09), as Apostolic Exarch of United States of America and Canada of the Armenians (USA) (1981.07.03 – retired 1993.09.18) and as emeritate.

=== Latin titular archbishopric ===
No later than 1696, the Catholic Church also established a [[Latin Rite]] [[Ancyra (Catholic titular see)|titular archbishopric of Ancyra]]. The last incumbent died in 1976.

== Demographics ==
[[File:Ankara road map.png|thumb|right|160px|Ankara [[metropolitan area]]]]

Ankara had a population of 75,000 in 1927. In 2013, Ankara Province had a population of 5,045,083.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turkey pop 2007&quot;&gt;[http://www.tuik.gov.tr/jsp/duyuru/upload/adnks_Harita_TR/HaritaTR.html Türkiye istatistik kurumu] Address-based population survey 2007. Retrieved on 9 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Ankara became the capital of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, it was designated as a planned city for 500,000 future inhabitants. During the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, the city grew in a planned and orderly pace. However, from the 1950s onward, the city grew much faster than envisioned, because unemployment and poverty forced people to migrate from the countryside into the city in order to seek a better standard of living. As a result, many illegal houses called [[gecekondu]] were built around the city, causing the unplanned and uncontrolled urban landscape of Ankara, as not enough planned housing could be built fast enough. Although precariously built, the vast majority of them have electricity, running water and modern household amenities.

Nevertheless, many of these gecekondus have been replaced by huge public housing projects in the form of [[tower block]]s such as Elvankent, [[Eryaman, Etimesgut|Eryaman]] and [[Güzelkent, Etimesgut|Güzelkent]]; and also as mass housing compounds for military and civil service accommodation. Although many gecekondus still remain, they too are gradually being replaced by mass housing compounds, as empty land plots in the city of Ankara for new construction projects are becoming impossible to find.

The city has exported [[mohair]] (from the [[Angora goat]]) and [[Angora wool]] (from the [[Angora rabbit]]) internationally for centuries. In the 19th century, the city also exported substantial amounts of [[Goatskin (material)|goat]] and [[catskin|cat skin]]s, [[gum arabic|gum]], [[beeswax|wax]], [[honey]], berries, and [[madder root]].{{sfn|Baynes|1878|p=45}} It was connected to [[Istanbul]] by railway before the [[First World War]], continuing to export mohair, wool, berries, and [[grain]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=40–41}}

The [[Central Anatolia Region]] is one of the primary locations of grape and [[Turkish wine|wine production in Turkey]], and Ankara is particularly famous for its [[Kalecik Karası]] and [[Muscat (grape and wine)|Muscat grapes]]; and its [[Kavaklıdere (winery)|Kavaklıdere wine]], which is produced in the [[Kavaklıdere, Ankara|Kavaklıdere]] neighbourhood within the [[Çankaya, Ankara|Çankaya]] district of the city. Ankara is also famous for its pears. Another renowned natural product of Ankara is its indigenous type of [[honey]] (''Ankara Balı'') which is known for its light color and is mostly produced by the [[Atatürk Forest Farm and Zoo]] in the Gazi district, and by other facilities in the Elmadağ, Çubuk and Beypazarı districts.

Ankara is the center of the state-owned and private Turkish [[Arms industry|defence]] and [[Aerospace manufacturer|aerospace]] companies, where the industrial plants and headquarters of the [[Turkish Aerospace Industries]], [[Mechanical and Chemical Industry Corporation (Turkey)|MKE]], [[ASELSAN]], [[Havelsan]], [[Roketsan]], [[FNSS Defence Systems|FNSS]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fnss.com.tr/|title=FNSS Savunma Sistemleri A.Ş.|author=FNSS Savunma Sistemleri A.Ş.|date=|work=FNSS Savunma Sistemleri A.Ş.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nurol Makina]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nurolmakina.com.tr/|title=Nurol Makina ve Sanayi A.Ş.|author=|date=|work=nurolmakina.com.tr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous other firms are located. Exports to foreign countries from these defence and aerospace firms have steadily increased in the past decades. The [[International Defence Industry Fair|IDEF]] in Ankara is one of the largest international expositions of the global [[arms industry]]. A number of the global [[automotive industry|automotive companies]] also have production facilities in Ankara, such as the German bus and truck manufacturer [[MAN SE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.man.com.tr/|title=MAN Turkiye|author=|date=|work=man.com.tr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ankara hosts the [[OSTIM Industrial Zone]], Turkey's largest [[industrial park]].

A large percentage of the complicated employment in Ankara is provided by the state institutions; such as the [[ministry (government department)|ministries]], undersecretariats, and other administrative bodies of the Turkish government. There are also many foreign citizens working as diplomats or clerks in the [[embassy|embassies]] of their respective countries.

Ankara is politically a triple battleground between the ruling conservative [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP), the opposition [[Kemalism|Kemalist]] centre-left [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP) and the nationalist far-right [[Nationalist Movement Party]] (MHP). The [[Ankara Province|province of Ankara]] is divided into 25 districts. The CHP's key and almost only political stronghold in Ankara lies within the central area of [[Çankaya, Ankara (district)|Çankaya]], which is the city's most populous district. While the CHP has always gained between 60 and 70% of the vote in Çankaya since 2002, political support elsewhere throughout Ankara is minimal. The high population within Çankaya, as well as [[Yenimahalle]] to an extent, has allowed the CHP to take overall second place behind the AKP in both local and general elections, with the MHP a close third, despite the fact that the MHP is politically stronger than the CHP in almost every other district. Overall, the AKP enjoys the most support throughout the city. The electorate of Ankara thus tend to vote in favour of the political right, far more so than the other main cities of [[Istanbul]] and [[İzmir]]. In retrospect, the [[2013–14 protests in Turkey|2013–14 protests against the AKP government]] were particularly strong in Ankara, proving to be fatal on multiple occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/05/ethem-sarisuluk-killed-turkey-protests_n_3390502.html|title=Turkish Protester Ethem Sarısülük Is Dead, Family Says [UPDATED]|author=|date=|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Melih Gökçek]] has been the Metropolitan Mayor of Ankara since 1994 as a politician from the [[Welfare Party]]. He later joined the [[Virtue Party]] and then the AKP. Initially elected in the [[Turkish local elections, 1994|1994 local elections]], he was re-elected in [[Turkish local elections, 1999|1999]], [[Turkish local elections, 2004|2004]] and [[Turkish local elections, 2009|2009]]. In the [[Turkish local elections, 2014|2014 local election]], Gökçek stood for a fifth term. The MHP metropolitan mayoral candidate for the 2009 local elections, conservative politician [[Mansur Yavaş]], stood as the CHP candidate against Gökçek. In a heavily controversial election, Gökçek was declared the winner by just 1% ahead of Yavaş amid allegations of systematic electoral fraud. With the [[Supreme Electoral Council of Turkey|Supreme Electoral Council]] and courts rejecting Yavaş's appeals, he has declared intention to take the irregularities to the [[European Court of Human Rights]].

====Ankara Citadel====
The foundations of the [[Ankara Castle|Ankara castle and citadel]] were laid by the Galatians on a prominent [[lava]] outcrop ({{Coord|39.941|N|32.864|E|type:landmark|display=inline}}), and the rest was completed by the Romans. The Byzantines and Seljuks further made restorations and additions. The area around and inside the citadel, being the oldest part of Ankara, contains many fine examples of traditional architecture. There are also recreational areas to relax. Many restored traditional Turkish houses inside the citadel area have found new life as restaurants, serving local cuisine.

The citadel was depicted in various Turkish banknotes during 1927–1952 and 1983–1989.&lt;ref&gt;The citadel was depicted in the following Turkish banknotes:

====Roman Theatre====
The remains, the stage, and the backstage of the Roman theatre can be seen outside [[Ankara Castle|the castle]]. Roman statues that were found here are exhibited in the [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]]. The seating area is still under excavation.

====Temple of Augustus and Rome==== &lt;!--linked--&gt;
{{main article|Monumentum Ancyranum}}
The Augusteum,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911b|p=953}} now known as the Temple of Augustus and Rome, was built 25&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|x|sometime between}}&amp;nbsp;20&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} following the conquest of Central Anatolia by the [[Roman Empire]]. Ancyra then formed the capital of the new [[Roman province|province]] of [[Galatia]]. After the death of [[Augustus]] in {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;14, a copy of the text of the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'' (the ''[[Monumentum Ancyranum]]'') was inscribed on the interior of the temple's ''{{lang|la|pronaos}}'' in Latin and a Greek translation on an exterior wall of the ''{{lang|la|cella}}''. The temple on the ancient acropolis of Ancyra was enlarged in the 2nd century and converted into a church in the 5th century. It is located in the Ulus quarter of the city. It was subsequently publicized by the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] ambassador [[Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq]] in the 16th century.

====Roman Baths====
The [[Roman Baths of Ankara]] have all the typical features of a classical [[Thermae|Roman bath complex]]: a ''[[frigidarium]]'' (cold room), a ''[[tepidarium]]'' (warm room) and a ''[[caldarium]]'' (hot room). The baths were built during the reign of the Roman emperor [[Caracalla]] in the early 3rd century to honor [[Asclepius|Asclepios]], the God of Medicine. Today, only the basement and first floors remain. It is situated in the Ulus quarter.

====Roman Road====
The [[Roman Road of Ankara]] or ''Cardo Maximus'' was found in 1995 by Turkish archaeologist Cevdet Bayburtluoğlu. It is {{convert|216|m|ft|abbr=off}} long and {{convert|6.7|m|ft|1|abbr=off}} wide. Many ancient artifacts were discovered during the excavations along the road and most of them are currently displayed at the [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://v3.arkitera.com/news.php?action=displayNewsItem&amp;ID=26016|title=Roma Yolu|date=14 March 2007|publisher=arkitera.com|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Antik Ankara&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sargın|first=Haluk|year=2012|title=Antik Ankara|publisher=Arkadaş Yayınevi|place=Ankara|isbn= 978-975-509-719-0|language=Turkish|pages=126, 127, 128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Column of Julian====
The Column of Julian or Julianus, now in the Ulus district, was erected in honor of the Roman emperor [[Julian the Apostate]]'s visit to Ancyra in 362.

=== Mosques ===

====Kocatepe Mosque====
[[Image:ANKARA KOCATEPE CAMİİ.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Kocatepe Mosque]] is the largest mosque in Ankara]]
[[Kocatepe Mosque]] is the largest mosque in the city. Located in the Kocatepe quarter, it was constructed between 1967 and 1987 in classical [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman style]] with four minarets. Its size and prominent location have made it a landmark for the city.

====Ahmet Hamdi Akseki Mosque====
Ahmet Hamdi Akseki Mosque is located near the Presidency of Religious Affairs on the [[Eskişehir]] Road. Built in the Turkish neoclassical style, it is one of the largest new mosques in the city, completed and opened in 2013. It can accommodate 6 thousand people during general prayers, and up to 30 thousand people during funeral prayers. The mosque was decorated with [[Sultanate of Rum|Anatolian]] [[Seljuk architecture|Seljuk style]] patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{tr icon}}[http://www.diyanet.gov.tr/tr/icerik/ahmet-hamdi-akseki-camii-dualarla-ibadete-acildi/8078 Ahmet Hamdi Akseki Mosque has been opened for prayers]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yeni (Cenab Ahmet) Mosque====
It is the largest Ottoman mosque in Ankara and was built by the famous architect Sinan in the 16th century. The mimber (pulpit) and mihrap (prayer niche) are of white marble, and the mosque itself is of Ankara stone, an example of very fine workmanship.

====Hacı Bayram Mosque====
[[Image:Haci Bayram Mosque 01.jpg|thumb|Hacı Bayram Mosque (1428)]]

== Shopping ==
[[File:Ankara Atakule.JPG|300px|thumb|left|[[Atakule Tower]] (1989)]]
{{Multiple image|align=right|direction=vertical|image1=Ankara Armada Alışveriş Merkezi.JPG|image2=Güvenpark Kızılay square.jpg|caption2=Armada shopping center (top)&lt;br/&gt;Kızılay shopping center (bottom)}}

Foreign visitors to Ankara usually like to visit the old shops in ''Çıkrıkçılar Yokuşu'' (Weavers' Road) near Ulus, where myriad things ranging from traditional fabrics, hand-woven carpets and leather products can be found at bargain prices. ''Bakırcılar Çarşısı'' (Bazaar of Coppersmiths) is particularly popular, and many interesting items, not just of copper, can be found here like jewelry, carpets, costumes, antiques and embroidery. Up the hill to the castle gate, there are many shops selling a huge and fresh collection of spices, [[dried fruit]]s, nuts, and other produce.

Modern shopping areas are mostly found in [[Kızılay, Ankara|Kızılay]], or on Tunalı Hilmi Avenue, including the modern mall of [[List of shopping malls in Turkey#Ankara|Karum]] (named after the ancient [[Assyria]]n merchant colonies called [[Kültepe#Kârum Kaneš|''Kârum'']] that were established in [[Central Anatolia Region|central]] [[Anatolia]] at the beginning of the [[2nd millennium BC]]) which is located towards the end of the Avenue; and in [[Çankaya, Ankara|Çankaya]], the quarter with the highest elevation in the city. [[Atakule|Atakule Tower]] next to [[Atakule#Atrium shopping mall|Atrium Mall]] in Çankaya commands a magnificent view over Ankara and also has a [[revolving restaurant]] at the top, where the city's panorama can be enjoyed in a leisurely fashion. The symbol of the [[List of shopping malls in Turkey#Ankara|Armada Shopping Mall]] is an [[anchor]], and there's a large anchor monument at its entrance, as a reference to the ancient Greek name of the city, Ἄγκυρα (Ánkyra), which means anchor. Likewise, the anchor monument is also related with the Spanish name of the mall, Armada, which means [[naval fleet]].

As Ankara started expanding westward in the 1970s, several modern, suburbia-style developments and mini-cities began to rise along the western highway, also known as the [[Eskişehir]] Road. The ''Armada'',''CEPA'' and ''Kentpark'' malls on the highway, the ''Galleria'', ''Arcadium'' and ''Gordion'' in Ümitköy, and a huge mall, ''Real'' in Bilkent Center, offer North American and European style shopping opportunities (these places can be reached through the Eskişehir Highway.) There is also the newly expanded ''[[ANKAmall]]'' at the outskirts, on the Istanbul Highway, which houses most of the well-known international brands. This mall is the largest throughout the Ankara region. In 2014 a few more shopping malls were open in Ankara. They are ''Next Level'' and ''Taurus'' on the Boulevard of [[Mevlana]] (also known as [[Konya]] Road).

==Fauna==

===Angora cat===
{{Main article|Turkish Angora}}
[[File:Odd-eyed Turkish Angora cat - 20080830.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Angora cat]]]]

Ankara is home to a world-famous domestic [[cat breed]] – the [[Turkish Angora]], called ''Ankara kedisi'' (Ankara cat) in Turkish. Turkish Angoras are one of the ancient, naturally occurring cat breeds, having originated in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia.

They mostly have a white, silky, medium to long length coat, no undercoat and a fine bone structure. There seems to be a connection between the Angora Cats and [[Persian (cat)|Persians]], and the Turkish Angora is also a distant cousin of the [[Turkish Van]]. Although they are known for their shimmery white coat, currently there are more than twenty varieties including black, blue and reddish fur. They come in [[tabby cat|tabby]] and tabby-white, along with smoke varieties, and are in every color other than pointed, lavender, and cinnamon (all of which would indicate breeding to an outcross.)

Eyes may be blue, green, or amber, or even one blue and one amber or green. The W gene which is responsible for the white coat and blue eye is closely related to the hearing ability, and the presence of a blue eye can indicate that the cat is deaf to the side the blue eye is located. However, a great many blue and [[odd-eyed cat|odd-eyed]] white cats have normal hearing, and even deaf cats lead a very normal life if kept indoors.

Ears are pointed and large, eyes are almond shaped and the head is massive with a two plane profile. Another characteristic is the tail, which is often kept parallel to the back.

===Angora rabbit===
{{Main article|Angora rabbit}}
[[File:Joey Giant Angora Buck.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Angora rabbit]]]]

The [[Angora rabbit]] ({{Lang-tr|Ankara tavşanı}}) is a variety of domestic rabbit bred for its long, soft hair. The Angora is one of the oldest types of domestic rabbit, originating in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia, along with the [[Turkish Angora|Angora cat]] and [[Angora goat]]. The rabbits were popular pets with French royalty in the mid-18th century, and spread to other parts of Europe by the end of the century. They first appeared in the United States in the early 20th century. They are bred largely for their long [[Angora wool]], which may be removed by [[sheep shearing|shear]]ing, combing, or [[plucking (hair removal)|pluck]]ing (gently pulling loose wool.)

Angoras are bred mainly for their wool because it is silky and soft. They have a humorous appearance, as they oddly resemble a fur ball. Most are calm and docile but should be handled carefully. Grooming is necessary to prevent the fiber from matting and felting on the rabbit. A condition called &quot;wool block&quot; is common in Angora rabbits and should be treated quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joyofhandspinning.com/angora-care.shtml |title=Angora Rabbit Breeds – How to Care for Your Angora Rabbit |accessdate=29 January 2009 |work= |publisher= |date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125215910/http://joyofhandspinning.com/angora-care.shtml |archivedate=25 January 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes they are shorn in the summer as the long fur can cause the rabbits to overheat.

===Angora goat===
{{Main article|Angora goat}}
[[File:Quebec angora goat.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Angora goat]]]]

The [[Angora goat]] ({{Lang-tr|Ankara keçisi}}) is a breed of [[goat|domestic goat]] that originated in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ekarius&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Carol Ekarius|title=Storey's Illustrated Breed Guide to Sheep, Goats, Cattle, and Pigs: 163 Breeds from Common to Rare|date=10 September 2008|publisher=Storey Publishing|isbn=978-1-60342-037-2|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This breed was first mentioned in the time of [[Moses]], roughly in 1500&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://daisyshillfarm.com/My_Homepage_Files/Page2.html |title=Angora Goats history |publisher=Daisyshillfarm.com |date= |accessdate=29 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703174935/http://daisyshillfarm.com/My_Homepage_Files/Page2.html |archivedate=3 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Angora goats were brought to Europe by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], about 1554, but, like later imports, were not very successful. Angora goats were first introduced in the United States in 1849 by Dr. James P. Davis. Seven adult goats were a gift from Sultan [[Abdülmecid I]] in appreciation for his services and advice on the raising of cotton.

The [[Pile (textile)|fleece]] taken from an Angora goat is called [[mohair]]. A single goat produces between {{convert|5|and|8|kg|spell=in|lk=out|abbr=off}} of hair per year. Angoras are shorn twice a year, unlike [[Domestic sheep|sheep]], which are shorn only once. Angoras have high nutritional requirements due to their rapid hair growth. A poor quality diet will curtail mohair development. The United States, [[Turkey]], and South Africa are the top producers of mohair.

For a long period of time, Angora goats were bred for their white coat. In 1998, the Colored Angora Goat Breeders Association was set up to promote breeding of colored Angoras. Today, Angora goats produce white, black (deep black to greys and silver), red (the color fades significantly as the goat gets older), and brownish fiber.

Angora goats were depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Turkish 50 [[Turkish lira|lira]] banknotes of 1938–1952.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5hFIaQq0J?url=http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ |date=3 June 2009 }}.
