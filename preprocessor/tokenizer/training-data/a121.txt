'''Algae''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|dʒ|i|,_|ˈ|æ|l|ɡ|i}}; singular '''alga''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|ɡ|ə}}) is an informal term for a large, diverse group of [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[organism]]s which are not necessarily closely related, and is thus [[polyphyletic]]. Included organisms range from [[unicellular]] genera, such as ''[[Chlorella]]'' and the [[diatom]]s, to [[multicellular]] forms, such as  the [[Macrocystis pyrifera|giant kelp]], a large [[brown algae|brown alga]] which may grow up to 50&amp;nbsp;m in length. Most are aquatic and [[autotrophic]] and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as [[stoma]]ta, [[xylem]], and [[phloem]], which are found in [[embryophyte|land plants]]. The largest and most complex marine algae are called [[seaweed]]s, while the most complex freshwater forms are the [[Charophyta]], a [[phylum|division]] of green algae which includes, for example, ''[[Spirogyra]]'' and the [[stonewort]]s.

No definition of algae is generally accepted. One definition is that algae &quot;have [[chlorophyll]] as their primary photosynthetic pigment and lack a sterile covering of cells around their reproductive cells&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lee, R. E. |year=2008 |title=Phycology |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors exclude all [[prokaryotes]]&lt;ref name=&quot;IntroBot&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Nabors |first=Murray W. |title=Introduction to Botany |year=2004 |publisher=Pearson Education, Inc |location=San Francisco, CA |isbn=978-0-8053-4416-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus do not consider [[cyanobacteria]] (blue-green algae) as algae.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allaby 92&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor1-last=Allaby |editor1-first=M. |year=1992 |encyclopedia=The Concise Dictionary of Botany |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |title=Algae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algae lack the various structures that characterize land plants, such as the phyllids (leaf-like structures) of [[bryophyte]]s, [[rhizoid]]s in [[nonvascular plants]], and the [[root]]s, [[leaf|leaves]], and other [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] found in [[tracheophyte]]s ([[vascular plants]]). Most are [[phototroph]]ic, although some are [[mixotroph]]ic, deriving energy both from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by [[osmotrophy]], [[myzocytosis|myzotrophy]], or [[phagocytosis|phagotrophy]]. Some unicellular species of [[green algae]], many [[golden algae]], [[euglenid]]s, [[dinoflagellate]]s, and other algae have become [[heterotroph]]s (also called colorless or apochlorotic algae), sometimes parasitic, relying entirely on external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;Pringsheim, E.G. 1963.

==Etymology and study==
The singular ''alga'' is the Latin word for &quot;seaweed&quot; and retains that meaning in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=alga, algae|encyclopedia=Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged with Seven Language Dictionary|volume=1|year=1986|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[etymology]] is obscure. Although some speculate that it is related to Latin ''algēre'', &quot;be cold&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Eric |last=Partridge |title=algae |encyclopedia=Origins |year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; no reason is known to associate seaweed with temperature. A more likely source is ''alliga'', &quot;binding, entwining&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=alga|first=Charlton T. |last=Lewis |author2=Charles Short |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1879 |isbn=978-0-19-864201-5 |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?layout.reflang=la;layout.refdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059;layout.reflookup=Alga;layout.refcit=;doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%231812}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Greek]] word for seaweed was φῦκος (''phŷcos''), which could mean either the seaweed (probably red algae) or a red dye derived from it. The Latinization, ''fūcus'', meant primarily the cosmetic rouge. The etymology is uncertain, but a strong candidate has long been some word related to the Biblical פוך (''pūk''), &quot;paint&quot; (if not that word itself), a cosmetic eye-shadow used by the ancient Egyptians and other inhabitants of the eastern Mediterranean. It could be any color: black, red, green, or blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Thomas Kelly Cheyne |author2= John Sutherland Black| title = Encyclopædia biblica: a critical dictionary of the literary, political and religious history, the archæology, geography, and natural history of the Bible| url = https://books.google.com/?id=GccVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA3525| year = 1902| publisher = Macmillan Company| isbn = | page = 3525 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, the modern study of marine and freshwater algae is called either [[phycology]] or algology, depending on whether the Greek or Latin root is used. The name ''Fucus'' appears in a number of [[taxon|taxa]].

[[File:Gephyrocapsa oceanica color.jpg|thumb|False-color [[scanning electron micrograph]] of the unicellular [[coccolithophore]] ''[[Gephyrocapsa]] oceanica'']]

Most algae contain [[chloroplast]]s that are similar in structure to cyanobacteria. Chloroplasts contain circular [[DNA]] like that in cyanobacteria and presumably represent reduced endosymbiotic cyanobacteria. However, the exact origin of the chloroplasts is different among separate lineages of algae, reflecting their acquisition during different endosymbiotic events. The table below describes the composition of the three major groups of algae. Their lineage relationships are shown in the figure in the upper right. Many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic. Some retain plastids, but not chloroplasts, while others have lost plastids entirely.

|These algae have 'primary' [[chloroplast]]s, i.e. the chloroplasts are surrounded by two membranes and probably developed through a single endosymbiotic event. The chloroplasts of red algae have [[chlorophyll]]s ''a'' and ''c'' (often), and [[phycobilin]]s, while those of green algae have chloroplasts with chlorophyll ''a'' and ''b'' without phycobilins. Land plants are pigmented similarly to green algae and probably developed from them, thus the [[Chlorophyta]] is a sister taxon to the plants; sometimes the Chlorophyta, the [[Charophyta]], and land plants are grouped together as the [[Viridiplantae]].

These groups have chloroplasts containing chlorophylls ''a'' and ''c'', and phycobilins. The shape varies from plant to plant; they may be of discoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral, or ribbon shaped. They have one or more pyrenoids to preserve protein and starch. The latter chlorophyll type is not known from any prokaryotes or primary chloroplasts, but genetic similarities with red algae suggest a relationship there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Janson |first=Sven |author2=Graneli, Edna |title=Genetic analysis of the psbA gene from single cells indicates a cryptomonad origin of the plastid in Dinophysis (Dinophyceae) |journal=Phycologia |date=September 2003 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=473–477 |publisher=Allen Press Publishing Services |issn=0031-8884 |doi=10.2216/i0031-8884-42-5-473.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first three of these groups (Chromista), the chloroplast has four membranes, retaining a [[nucleomorph]] in [[cryptomonad]]s, and they likely share a common pigmented ancestor, although other evidence casts doubt on whether the [[heterokont]]s, [[Haptophyta]], and [[cryptomonad]]s are in fact more closely related to each other than to other groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;parfrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evaluating Support for the Current Classification of Eukaryotic Diversity |authors=Laura Wegener Parfrey, Erika Barbero, Elyse Lasser, Micah Dunthorn, Debashish Bhattacharya, David J Patterson, and Laura A Katz |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020220 |journal=PLoS Genet. |date=December 2006 |volume=2 |issue=12 |pages =e220 |pmid=17194223 |pmc=1713255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Burki F, Shalchian-Tabrizi K, Minge M, Skjæveland Å, Nikolaev SI |year=2007 |title=Phylogenomics Reshuffles the Eukaryotic Supergroups |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=2 |issue=8 |page=e790 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000790 |pmid=17726520 |pmc=1949142 |editor1-last=Butler |editor1-first=Geraldine |bibcode=2007PLoSO...2..790B |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Species Plantarum'', vol. 2, p. 1131, [http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/13830#page/573/mode/1up].&lt;/ref&gt; the starting point for modern [[botanical nomenclature]], recognized 14 genera of algae, of which only four are currently considered among algae.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, O. P. (1986). Textbook of Algae. McGraw Hill. p. 22, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hOa74Hm4zDIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA22].&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[10th edition of Systema Naturae|Systema Naturae]]'', Linnaeus described the genera ''[[Volvox]]'' and ''[[Corallina]]'', and a species of ''[[Acetabularia]]'' (as ''[[Madrepora]]''), among the animals.

In 1768, [[Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin]] (1744–1774) published the ''Historia Fucorum'', the first work dedicated to marine algae and the first book on [[marine biology]] to use the then new binomial nomenclature of Linnaeus. It included elaborate illustrations of seaweed and marine algae on folded leaves.&lt;ref&gt;Gmelin S G (1768) [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=YUAAAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Historia+Fucorum%22&amp;hl=en ''Historia Fucorum''] Ex typographia Academiae scientiarum, St. Petersburg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silva PC, Basson PW and Moe RL (1996) [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=vuWEemVY8WEC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=%22Historia+Fucorum%22+binomial+nomenclature&amp;source=bl&amp;hl=en ''Catalogue of the Benthic Marine Algae of the Indian Ocean''] page 2, University of California Press. {{ISBN|978-0-520-91581-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, microscopic algae were discovered and reported by a different group of workers (e.g., [[Otto Friedrich Müller|O. F. Müller]] and [[Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg|Ehrenberg]]) studying the [[Infusoria]] (microscopic organisms). Unlike [[macroalgae]], which were clearly viewed as plants, [[microalgae]] were frequently considered animals because they are often motile.&lt;ref&gt;Medlin et al. (1997), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the nonmotile (coccoid) microalgae were sometimes merely seen as stages of the lifecycle of plants, macroalgae, or animals.&lt;ref&gt;Braun, A.

Although used as a taxonomic category in some pre-Darwinian classifications, e.g., Linnaeus (1753), de Jussieu (1789), Horaninow (1843), Agassiz (1859), Wilson &amp; Cassin (1864), in further classifications, the &quot;algae&quot; are seen as an artificial, polyphyletic group.

Throughout the 20th century, most classifications treated the following groups as divisions or classes of algae: [[cyanophyte]]s, [[rhodophyte]]s, [[chrysophyte]]s, [[xanthophyte]]s, [[diatom|bacillariophyte]]s, [[phaeophyte]]s, [[Dinoflagellate#history|pyrrhophyte]]s ([[Cryptomonad|cryptophyte]]s and [[dinophyte]]s), [[euglenophyte]]s, and [[chlorophyte]]s. Later, many new groups were discovered (e.g., [[Bolidophyceae]]), and others were splintered from older groups: [[charophyte]]s and [[glaucophyte]]s (from chlorophytes), many [[heterokontophyte]]s (e.g., [[Synurophyceae|synurophytes]] from chrysophytes, or [[eustigmatophyte]]s from xanthophytes), [[haptophyte]]s (from chrysophytes), and [[chlorarachniophyte]]s (from xanthophytes).

With the abandonment of plant-animal dichotomous classification, most groups of algae (sometimes all) were included in [[Protist]]a, later also abandoned in favour of [[Eukaryota]]. However, as a legacy of the older plant life scheme, some groups that were also treated as [[protozoa]]ns in the past still have duplicated classifications (see [[ambiregnal protist]]s).

Some parasitic algae (e.g., the green algae ''[[Prototheca]]'' and ''[[Helicosporidium]]'', parasites of metazoans, or ''[[Cephaleuros]]'', parasites of plants) were originally classified as [[fungi]], [[sporozoan]]s, or [[protist]]ans of ''[[incertae sedis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=B.

In other cases, some groups were originally characterized as parasitic algae (e.g., ''[[Chlorochytrium]]''), but later were seen as [[endophytic]] algae.&lt;ref&gt;Round (1981). pp.&amp;nbsp;398–400, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Rm08AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA262&amp;hl=&amp;pg=PA398].&lt;/ref&gt; Some filamentous bacteria (e.g., ''[[Beggiatoa]]'') were originally seen as algae. Furthermore, groups like the [[apicomplexan]]s are also parasites derived from ancestors that possessed plastids, but are not included in any group traditionally seen as algae.

==Relationship to land plants==
The first land plants probably evolved from shallow freshwater charophyte algae much like ''[[Chara (alga)|Chara]]'' almost 500 million years ago. These probably had an isomorphic [[alternation of generations]] and were probably filamentous. Fossils of isolated land plant spores suggest land plants may have been around as long as 475 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = When plants conquered land | author = Ivan Noble | date = 18 September 2003 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3117034.stm | publisher = BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wellman2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wellman, C.H. |author2= Osterloff, P.L.|author3= Mohiuddin, U. | year = 2003| title = Fragments of the earliest land plants| journal = Nature| volume = 425

==Morphology==
[[File:Kelp-forest-Monterey.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[kelp forest]] exhibit at the Monterey Bay Aquarium: A three-dimensional, multicellular thallus]]

A range of algal [[Morphology (biology)|morphologies]] is exhibited, and [[Convergent evolution|convergence]] of features in unrelated groups is common. The only groups to exhibit three-dimensional multicellular [[Thallus|thalli]] are the [[Red algae|reds]] and [[Brown algae|browns]], and some [[Chlorophyta|chlorophytes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Xiao2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Xiao | first1 = S.

Most of the simpler algae are [[unicellular]] [[flagellate]]s or [[amoeboid]]s, but colonial and nonmotile forms have developed independently among several of the groups. Some of the more common organizational levels, more than one of which may occur in the [[biological life cycle|lifecycle]] of a species, are
* [[Colony (biology)|Colonial]]: small, regular groups of motile cells
* Capsoid: individual non-motile cells embedded in [[mucilage]]
* Coccoid: individual non-motile cells with cell walls
* Palmelloid: nonmotile cells embedded in mucilage
* Filamentous: a string of nonmotile cells connected together, sometimes branching
* Parenchymatous: cells forming a thallus with partial differentiation of tissues

In three lines, even higher levels of organization have been reached, with full tissue differentiation. These are the brown algae,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/chromista/phaeophyta.html|title= Introduction to the Phaeophyta: Kelps and brown &quot;Algae&quot;|first=Ben|last=Waggoner|publisher=University of California Museum of Palaeontology (UCMP)|date=1994–2008|accessdate=19 December 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081221171218/http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/chromista/phaeophyta.html| archivedate= 21 December 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;—some of which may reach 50&amp;nbsp;m in length ([[kelp]]s)&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 02&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Thomas| first = D N| title = Seaweeds| year = 2002| publisher = The Natural History Museum| location = London| isbn = 978-0-565-09175-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—the red algae,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/protista/rhodophyta.html |title= Introduction to the Rhodophyta, The red &quot;algae&quot;| first=Ben |last=Waggoner |publisher=University of California Museum of Palaeontology (UCMP) |date=1994–2008 |accessdate=19 December 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081218211021/http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/protista/rhodophyta.html | archivedate= 18 December 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the green algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/greenalgae/greenalgae.html|title=Introduction to the Green Algae|work=berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most complex forms are found among the green algae (see [[Charales]] and [[Charophyta]]), in a lineage that eventually led to the higher land plants. The point where these nonalgal plants begin and algae stop is usually taken to be the presence of reproductive organs with protective cell layers, a characteristic not found in the other algal groups.

==Physiology==
Many algae, particularly members of the [[Characeae]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tazawa |first=Masashi |title=Sixty Years Research with Characean Cells: Fascinating Material for Plant Cell Biology |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iMxH0-q42PkC&amp;pg=PA31 |accessdate=7 October 2012 |volume=72 |year=2010 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-13145-5 |pages=5–34 |journal=Progress in Botany |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-13145-5_1 |series=Progress in Botany}}&lt;/ref&gt; have served as model experimental organisms to understand the mechanisms of the water permeability of membranes, [[osmoregulation]], [[turgor regulation]], [[salt tolerance]], [[cytoplasmic streaming]], and the generation of [[action potentials]].

[[Phytohormone]]s are found not only in higher plants, but in algae, too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tarakhovskaya |first1=E. R. |last2=Maslov |first2=Yu. I. |last3=Shishova |first3=M. F. |date=April 2007 |title=Phytohormones in algae |journal=Russian Journal of Plant Physiology |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=163–170 |doi=10.1134/s1021443707020021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbiotic algae==
Some species of algae form [[symbiosis|symbiotic relationships]] with other organisms. In these symbioses, the algae supply photosynthates (organic substances) to the host organism providing protection to the algal cells. The host organism derives some or all of its energy requirements from the algae. Examples are:

===Lichens===
{{Main article|Lichen}}
[[File:Lichens near Clogher Head (stevefe).jpg|thumb|Rock lichens in Ireland]]
[[Lichen]]s are defined by the [[International Association for Lichenology]] to be &quot;an association of a fungus and a photosynthetic [[symbiont]] resulting in a stable vegetative body having a specific structure.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Brodo| first = Irwin M| last2 = Sharnoff| first2 = Sylvia Duran| last3 = Sharnoff| first3 = Stephen| last4 = Laurie-Bourque| first4 = Susan| title = Lichens of North America| year = 2001| publisher = Yale University Press| location = New Haven| isbn = 978-0-300-08249-4| page = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fungi, or mycobionts, are mainly from the [[Ascomycota]] with a few from the [[Basidiomycota]]. They are not found alone in nature; but when they began to associate is not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Pearson| first = Lorentz C| title = The Diversity and Evolution of Plants| year = 1995| publisher = CRC Press| isbn = 978-0-8493-2483-3| page = 221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One mycobiont associates with the same phycobiont species, rarely two, from the green algae, except that alternatively, the mycobiont may associate with a species of cyanobacteria (hence &quot;photobiont&quot; is the more accurate term). A photobiont may be associated with many different mycobionts or may live independently; accordingly, lichens are named and classified as fungal species.&lt;ref&gt;Brodo et al. (2001), page 6: &quot;A species of lichen collected anywhere in its range has the same lichen-forming fungus and, generally, the same photobiont. (A particular photobiont, though, may associate with scores of different lichen fungi).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The association is termed a morphogenesis because the lichen has a form and capabilities not possessed by the symbiont species alone (they can be experimentally isolated). The photobiont possibly triggers otherwise latent genes in the mycobiont.&lt;ref&gt;Brodo et al. (2001), page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coral reefs===
{{Main article|Coral|Coral reef|Symbiodinium}}
[[File:Coral Reef.jpg|thumb|Floridian coral reef]] [[Coral reef]]s are accumulated from the [[calcareous]] [[exoskeleton]]s of [[marine invertebrate]]s of the order [[Scleractinia]] (stony [[coral]]s). These [[Animal#Food and energy sourcing|animals]] [[Metabolism|metabolize]] [[Sugar#Chemistry|sugar]] and oxygen to obtain energy for their cell-building processes, including [[secretion]] of the exoskeleton, with water and [[carbon dioxide]] as byproducts. Dinoflagellates (algal protists) are often endosymbionts in the cells of the coral-forming marine invertebrates, where they accelerate host-cell metabolism by generating immediately available sugar and oxygen through photosynthesis using incident light and the carbon dioxide produced by the host. Reef-building stony corals ([[hermatypic coral]]s) require endosymbiotic algae from the genus ''[[Symbiodinium]]'' to be in a healthy condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Taylor| first = Dennis L| editor-last = Goff| editor-first = Lynda J| title = Algal Symbiosis: A Continuum of Interaction Strategies| year = 1983| publisher = CUP Archive| isbn = 978-0-521-25541-7| pages = 19–20| contribution = The coral-algal symbiosis }}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of ''Symbiodinium'' from the host is known as [[coral bleaching]], a condition which leads to the deterioration of a reef.

===Sea sponges===
{{Main article|Sea sponge}}
Green algae live close to the surface of some sponges, for example, breadcrumb sponge (''[[Halichondria panicea]]''). The alga is thus protected from predators; the sponge is provided with oxygen and sugars which can account for 50 to 80% of sponge growth in some species.&lt;ref&gt;http://uwsp.edu/cnr/UWEXlakes/laketides/vol26-4/vol26-4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lifecycle==
[[Rhodophyta]], [[Chlorophyta]], and [[Heterokontophyta]], the three main algal [[phylum|divisions]], have lifecycles which show considerable variation and complexity. In general, an asexual phase exists where the seaweed's cells are [[diploid]], a sexual phase where the cells are [[haploid]], followed by fusion of the male and female [[gamete]]s. Asexual reproduction permits efficient population increases, but less variation is possible. Commonly, in sexual reproduction of unicellular and colonial algae, two specialized, sexually compatible, haploid gametes make physical contact and fuse to form a [[zygote]]. To ensure a successful mating, the development and release of gametes is highly synchronized and regulated; pheromones may play a key role in these processes.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid24597605&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Frenkel J, Vyverman W, Pohnert G |title=Pheromone signaling during sexual reproduction in algae |journal=Plant J. |volume=79 |issue=4 |pages=632–44 |year=2014 |pmid=24597605 |doi=10.1111/tpj.12496 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual reproduction allows for more variation and provides the benefit of efficient recombinational repair of DNA damages during meiosis, a key stage of the sexual cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Harris Bernstein, Carol Bernstein and Richard E.

==Numbers==
[[File:Taiwan 2009 East Coast ShihTiPing Giant Stone Steps Algae FRD 6581.jpg|thumb|Algae on coastal rocks at [[:zh:石梯坪|Shihtiping]] in Taiwan]]
The ''Algal Collection of the US National Herbarium'' (located in the [[National Museum of Natural History]]) consists of approximately 320,500 dried specimens, which, although not exhaustive (no exhaustive collection exists), gives an idea of the order of magnitude of the number of algal species (that number remains unknown).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Algae Herbarium|publisher=National Museum of Natural History, Department of Botany|year=2008|url=http://botany.si.edu/projects/algae/herbarium.htm|accessdate=19 December 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081201112552/http://botany.si.edu/projects/algae/herbarium.htm| archivedate= 1 December 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates vary widely. For example, according to one standard textbook,&lt;ref name=&quot;John 02&quot;&gt;John (2002), page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; in the British Isles the ''UK Biodiversity Steering Group Report'' estimated there to be 20,000 algal species in the UK. Another checklist reports only about 5,000 species. Regarding the difference of about 15,000 species, the text concludes: &quot;It will require many detailed field surveys before it is possible to provide a reliable estimate of the total number of species&amp;nbsp;...&quot;

Regional and group estimates have been made, as well:
* 5,000–5,500 species of red algae worldwide
* &quot;some 1,300 in Australian Seas&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Huisman 00&quot;&gt;Huisman (2000), page 25.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 400 seaweed species for the western coastline of South Africa,&lt;ref name=&quot;Stegenga 97&quot;&gt;Stegenga (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; and 212 species from the coast of KwaZulu-Natal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Clerck| first = Olivier| title = Guide to the seaweeds of KwaZulu-Natal| year = 2005| isbn = 978-90-72619-64-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these are duplicates, as the range extends across both coasts, and the total recorded is probably about 500 species. Most of these are listed in [[List of seaweeds of South Africa]]. These exclude [[phytoplankton]] and crustose corallines.
* 669 marine species from California (US)&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott and Hollenberg 76&quot;&gt;Abbott and Hollenberg (1976), page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 642 in the check-list of Britain and Ireland&lt;ref name=&quot;Hardy nad Guiry 06&quot;&gt;Hardy and Guiry (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;
and so on, but lacking any scientific basis or reliable sources, these numbers have no more credibility than the British ones mentioned above. Most estimates also omit microscopic algae, such as phytoplankton.

The most recent estimate suggests 72,500 algal species worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guiry | first1 = M. D. | year = 2012 | title = How Many Species of Algae Are There? | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263561612| journal = Journal of Phycology | volume = 48 | issue = 5| pages = 1057–1063 | doi = 10.1111/j.1529-8817.2012.01222.x | pmid=27011267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
The distribution of algal species has been fairly well studied since the founding of [[phytogeography]] in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name=Round8&gt;{{cite book|author=Round, FE |date=1981 |title=The ecology of algae |chapter= Chapter 8, Dispersal, continuity and phytogeography |pages=357–361 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rm08AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA262&amp;hl=&amp;pg=PA398#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algae spread mainly by the dispersal of [[spore]]s analogously to the dispersal of Plantae by seeds and spores. This dispersal can be accomplished by air, water, or other organisms. Due to this, spores can be found in a variety of environments: fresh and marine waters, air, soil, and in or on other organisms.&lt;ref name=Round8/&gt; Whether a spore is to grow into an organism depends on the combination of the species and the environmental conditions where the spore lands.

The spores of freshwater algae are dispersed mainly by running water and wind, as well as by living carriers.&lt;ref name=Round8/&gt; However, not all bodies of water can carry all species of algae, as the chemical composition of certain water bodies limits the algae that can survive within them.&lt;ref name=Round8/&gt; Marine spores are often spread by ocean currents. Ocean water presents many vastly different habitats based on temperature and nutrient availability, resulting in phytogeographic zones, regions, and provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Round (1981), page 362.&lt;/ref&gt;

To some degree, the distribution of algae is subject to floristic discontinuities caused by geographical features, such as [[Antarctica]], long distances of ocean or general land masses. It is, therefore, possible to identify species occurring by locality, such as &quot;Pacific algae&quot; or &quot;North Sea algae&quot;. When they occur out of their localities, hypothesizing a transport mechanism is usually possible, such as the hulls of ships. For example, ''Ulva reticulata'' and ''U. fasciata'' travelled from the mainland to Hawaii in this manner.

Mapping is possible for select species only: &quot;there are many valid examples of confined distribution patterns.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Round (1981), Page 357.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''Clathromorphum'' is an arctic genus and is not mapped far south of there.&lt;ref&gt;Round (1981), page 371.&lt;/ref&gt; However, scientists regard the overall data as insufficient due to the &quot;difficulties of undertaking such studies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Round (1981), page 366.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
[[File:Phytoplankton Lake Chuzenji.jpg|thumb|left|Phytoplankton, [[Lake Chuzenji]]]]
Algae are prominent in bodies of water, common in terrestrial environments, and are found in unusual environments, such as on [[Snow algae|snow]] and [[Ice algae|ice]]. Seaweeds grow mostly in shallow marine waters, under {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep; however, some such as [[Navicula]] pennata have been recorded to a depth of {{convert|360|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Round (1981), page 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

The various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic ecology. Microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column ([[phytoplankton]]) provide the food base for most marine [[food chain]]s. In very high densities ([[algal bloom]]s), these algae may discolor the water and outcompete, poison, or [[asphyxiate]] other life forms.

Algae can be used as [[indicator organism]]s to monitor pollution in various aquatic systems.&lt;ref name=Omar2010&gt;{{cite journal|title=Perspectives on the Use of Algae as Biological Indicators for Monitoring and Protecting Aquatic Environments, with Special Reference to Malaysian Freshwater Ecosystems |author=Wan Maznah Wan Omar |pmc=3819078 |journal=Trop Life Sci Res |date=Dec 2010 |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=51–67 |pmid=24575199}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, algal metabolism is sensitive to various pollutants. Due to this, the species composition of algal populations may shift in the presence of chemical pollutants.&lt;ref name=Omar2010/&gt; To detect these changes, algae can be sampled from the environment and maintained in laboratories with relative ease.&lt;ref name=Omar2010/&gt;

On the basis of their habitat, algae can be categorized as: [[Aquatic plant|aquatic]] ([[planktonic]], [[benthic]], [[Marine biology|marine]], [[freshwater]], [[lentic]], [[lotic]]),&lt;ref&gt;Necchi Jr., O.

==Cultural associations==
In [[classical Chinese]], the word {{lang|zh|{{linktext|藻}}}} is used both for &quot;algae&quot; and (in the modest tradition of the [[scholar-official|imperial scholars]]) for &quot;literary talent&quot;. The third island in [[Kunming Lake]] beside the [[Summer Palace]] in Beijing is known as the Zaojian Tang Dao, which thus simultaneously means &quot;Island of the Algae-Viewing Hall&quot; and &quot;Island of the Hall for Reflecting on Literary Talent&quot;.

==Uses==
[[File:Algae Harvester.jpg|thumb|Harvesting algae]]

===Agar===
[[Agar]], a [[gelatin]]ous substance derived from red algae, has a number of commercial uses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis ''et al.'' 88&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Lewis| first = J G| last2 = Stanley| first2 = N F| last3 = Guist| first3 = G G| editor-last = Lembi| editor-first = C.A.| editor2-last= Waaland| editor2-first = J.R.| title = Algae and Human Affairs| year = 1988| publisher = Cambridge University Press| location = Cambridge| isbn = 978-0-521-32115-0| contribution = 9 Commercial production of algal hydrocolloides }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a good medium on which to grow bacteria and fungi, as most microorganisms cannot digest agar.

===Alginates===
Alginic acid, or alginate, is extracted from brown algae. Its uses range from gelling agents in food, to medical dressings. Alginic acid also has been used in the field of [[biotechnology]] as a [[Biocompatibility|biocompatible medium]] for cell encapsulation and cell immobilization. [[Molecular cuisine]] is also a user of the substance for its gelling properties, by which it becomes a delivery vehicle for flavours.

Between 100,000 and 170,000 wet tons of ''[[Macrocystis]]'' are harvested annually in [[New Mexico]] for [[Alginic acid|alginate]] extraction and [[abalone]] feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.algaebase.org/generadetail.lasso?genus_id=35715&amp;-session=abv3:51909EC307dcf25DFApmi3530315|publisher=AlgaeBase|title=Macrocystis C.

For centuries, seaweed has been used as a fertilizer; [[George Owen of Henllys]] writing in the 16th century referring to drift weed in [[South Wales]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England|volume=10|pages=142–143|title=On the Farming of South Wales: Prize Report|first=Clare Sewell|last=Read|authorlink=Clare Sewell Read|year=1849|location=London|publisher=John Murray}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=UJYEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=%22this+kind+of+ore+they+often+gather%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPR4,M1 Downloadable Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This kind of ore they often gather and lay on great heapes, where it heteth and rotteth, and will have a strong and loathsome smell; when being so rotten they cast on the land, as they do their muck, and thereof springeth good corn, especially barley&amp;nbsp;... After spring-tydes or great rigs of the sea, they fetch it in sacks on horse backes, and carie the same three, four, or five miles, and cast it on the lande, which doth very much better the ground for corn and grass.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Dulse.JPG|thumb|Dulse, a type of food]]
Naturally growing seaweeds are an important source of food, especially in Asia. They provide many vitamins including: A, [[Thiamine|B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Riboflavin|B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Vitamin B6|B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[niacin]], and [[Vitamin C|C]], and are rich in [[iodine]], [[potassium]], iron, [[magnesium]], and [[calcium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Simoons| first = Frederick J| title = Food in China: A Cultural and Historical Inquiry| year = 1991| publisher = CRC Press| isbn = 978-0-936923-29-1| pages = 179–190| chapter = 6, Seaweeds and Other Algae }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, commercially cultivated microalgae, including both algae and cyanobacteria, are marketed as nutritional supplements, such as [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siu.edu/~ebl/leaflets/algae.htm |work=Ethnobotanical Leaflets |title=Modern Uses of Cultivated Algae |publisher=Southern Illinois University Carbondale |first=Steve L |last=Morton |accessdate=26 December 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223081614/http://www.siu.edu/~ebl/leaflets/algae.htm |archivedate=23 December 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chlorella]]'' and the vitamin-C supplement from ''[[Dunaliella]]'', high in [[beta-carotene]].

Fish oil contains the omega-3 fatty acids, but the original source is algae (microalgae in particular), which are eaten by marine life such as [[copepod]]s and are passed up the food chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15823852 | publisher = [[National Public Radio]] | title = Morning Edition: Getting Brain Food Straight from the Source | author = Allison Aubrey | date = 1 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Algae have emerged in recent years as a popular source of omega-3 fatty acids for vegetarians who cannot get long-chain EPA and DHA from other vegetarian sources such as [[flaxseed oil]], which only contains the short-chain [[alpha-linolenic acid]] (ALA).

===Pollution control===

* Algae can be used to capture fertilizers in runoff from farms. When subsequently harvested, the enriched algae can be used as fertilizer.
* Aquaria and ponds can be filtered using algae, which absorb nutrients from the water in a device called an [[algae scrubber]], also known as an algae turf scrubber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reefbase.org/resource_center/publication/main.aspx?refid=10859|title=ReefBase :: Main Publications : Nutrient cycling in the Great Barrier Reef Aquarium - Proceedings of the 6th International Coral Reef Symposium, Australia|year=1988|volume=2|authors=Morrissey, J., M.S.

[[Agricultural Research Service]] scientists found that 60–90% of nitrogen runoff and 70–100% of phosphorus runoff can be captured from [[manure effluents]] using a horizontal algae scrubber, also called an [[algal turf scrubber]] (ATS). Scientists developed the ATS, which consists of shallow, 100-foot raceways of nylon netting where algae colonies can form, and studied its efficacy for three years. They found that algae can readily be used to reduce the nutrient runoff from agricultural fields and increase the quality of water flowing into rivers, streams, and oceans. Researchers collected and dried the nutrient-rich algae from the ATS and studied its potential as an organic fertilizer. They found that cucumber and corn seedlings grew just as well using ATS organic fertilizer as they did with commercial fertilizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|date=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algae scrubbers, using bubbling upflow or vertical waterfall versions, are now also being used to filter aquaria and ponds.

===Bioremediation===
The alga ''[[Stichococcus bacillaris]]'' has been seen to colonize silicone resins used at archaeological sites; [[Biodegradation|biodegrading]] the synthetic substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Microorganisms Attack Synthetic Polymers in Items Representing Our Cultural Heritage |first1=Francesca |last1=Cappitelli |first2=Claudia |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |year=2008 |volume=74 |pmc=2227722 |last2=Sorlini |issue=3 |pages=564–569 |doi=10.1128/AEM.01768-07 |pmid=18065627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pigments===
The natural [[pigment]]s ([[carotenoid]]s and [[chlorophyll]]s) produced by algae can be used as alternatives to chemical [[dye]]s and coloring agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Arad| first = Shoshana| last2 = Spharim| first2 = Ishai| editor-last = Altman| editor-first = Arie| title = Agricultural Biotechnology| series = Books in Soils, Plants, and the Environment| volume = 61| year = 1998| publisher = CRC Press| isbn = 978-0-8247-9439-2| page = 638| contribution = Production of Valuable Products from Microalgae: An Emerging Agroindustry }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The presence of some individual algal pigments, together with specific pigment concentration ratios, are taxon-specific: analysis of their concentrations with various analytical methods, particularly [[high-performance liquid chromatography]], can therefore offer deep insight into the taxonomic composition and relative abundance of natural alga populations in sea water samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=C.
