'''Apus''' is a small [[constellation]] in the [[Southern Celestial Hemisphere|southern sky]]. It represents a [[bird-of-paradise]], and its name means &quot;without feet&quot; in [[Greek language|Greek]] because the bird-of-paradise was once wrongly believed to lack feet. First depicted on a celestial globe by [[Petrus Plancius]] in 1598, it was charted on a star atlas by [[Johann Bayer]] in his 1603 ''[[Uranometria]]''. The French explorer and astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] charted and gave the brighter stars their [[Bayer designation]]s in 1756.

The five brightest stars are all reddish in hue. Shading the others at [[apparent magnitude]] 3.8 is [[Alpha Apodis]], an orange giant that has around 48 times the diameter and 928 times the [[luminosity]] of the Sun. Marginally fainter is [[Gamma Apodis]], another ageing giant star. [[Delta Apodis]] is a [[double star]], the two components of which are 103 [[Minute and second of arc|arcseconds]] apart and visible with the naked eye. Two star systems have been found to have [[exoplanet|planets]].

==History==
Apus was one of twelve constellations created by [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]] who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the ''[[First Dutch Expedition to Indonesia|Eerste Schipvaart]]'', to the [[East Indies]]. It first appeared on a 35-cm (14&amp;nbsp;in) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with [[Jodocus Hondius]].&lt;ref name=ridpathbayer&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/bayer%20southern.htm | title=Johann Bayer's Southern Star Chart|last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|author-link=Ian Ridpath|publisher=self-published |work=Star Tales | accessdate= 30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- cites previous 2 sentences --&gt; De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue in 1603 under the Dutch name ''De Paradijs Voghel'', &quot;The Bird of Paradise&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/startales1c.htm#houtman | title=Frederick de Houtman's Catalogue|last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|publisher=self-published |work=Star Tales | accessdate= 30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Plancius called the constellation ''Paradysvogel Apis Indica''; the first word is [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for &quot;bird of paradise&quot;. ''Apis'' (Latin for &quot;bee&quot;) is assumed to have been a typographical error for ''avis'' (&quot;bird&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/apus.htm |title = Apus |last = Ridpath |first = Ian |work = Star Tales |accessdate = 10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its introduction on Plancius's globe, the constellation's first known appearance in a celestial atlas was in German cartographer [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603.&lt;ref name=ridpathbayer/&gt; Bayer called it ''Apis Indica'' while fellow astronomers [[Johannes Kepler]] and his son-in-law [[Jakob Bartsch]] called it ''Apus'' or ''Avis Indica''.&lt;ref name=wagman&gt;{{cite book| last = Wagman |first = Morton| date = 2003| title = Lost Stars: Lost, Missing and Troublesome Stars from the Catalogues of Johannes Bayer, Nicholas Louis de Lacaille, John Flamsteed, and Sundry Others| publisher = The McDonald &amp; Woodward Publishing Company| location = Blacksburg, Virginia| isbn = 978-0-939923-78-6 |pages=30–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Apus'' is derived from the Greek ''apous'', meaning &quot;without feet&quot;. This referred to the Western misconception that the bird-of-paradise had no feet, which arose because the only specimens available in the West had their feet and wings removed. Such specimens began to arrive in Europe in 1522, when the survivors of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s expedition brought them home.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;&lt;!-- cites previous two sentences --&gt; The constellation later lost some of its tail when [[Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille]] used those stars to establish [[Octans]] in the 1750s.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;&lt;!-- cites previous 1.5 sentences --&gt;
