'''Alfheim''' ({{Lang-non|Álfheimr}}, &quot;Land Of The Elves&quot; or &quot;Elfland&quot;), also called '''Ljosalfheim''' (''Ljósálf[a]heimr'', &quot;home of the [[Ljósálfar|light-elves]]&quot;), is one of the [[Norse cosmology|Nine Worlds]] and home of the [[Elf#Old_Norse_texts|Light Elves]] in [[Norse mythology]].

==In Old Norse texts==
{{Also|Svartálfaheimr}}
Álfheim as an abode of the Elves is mentioned only twice in [[Old Norse]] texts.

The [[eddic poem]] ''[[Grímnismál]]'' describes twelve divine dwellings beginning in stanza&amp;nbsp;5 with:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Ýdalir]] call they &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; the place where [[Ullr|Ull]]&lt;br/&gt;
A hall for himself hath set;&lt;br/&gt;
And Álfheim the gods &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; to [[Freyr|Frey]] once gave&lt;br/&gt;
As a tooth-gift in ancient times.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A tooth-gift was a gift given to an [[infant]] on the cutting of the first tooth.

In the 12th century eddic prose ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', [[Snorri Sturluson]] relates it as the first of a series of abodes in heaven:
&lt;blockquote&gt;That which is called Álfheim is one, where dwell the peoples called ''[[ljósálfar]]'' [Light Elves]; but the ''[[dökkálfar]]'' [Dark Elves] dwell down in the earth, and they are unlike in appearance, but by far more unlike in nature. The Light-elves are fairer to look upon than the sun, but the Dark-elves are blacker than pitch.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The account later, in speaking of a hall in the Highest Heaven called [[Gimlé]] that shall survive when heaven and earth have died, explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is said that another heaven is to the southward and upward of this one, and it is called [[Andlang]] [''Andlangr'' 'Endlong'] but the third heaven is yet above that, and it is called [[Vídbláin]] [''Vídbláinn'' 'Wide-blue'] and in that heaven we think this abode is. But we believe that none but Light-Elves inhabit these mansions now.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is not indicated whether these heavens are identical to Álfheim or distinct. Some texts read Vindbláin (''Vindbláinn'' 'Wind-blue') instead of Vídbláin.

Modern commentators speculate (or sometimes state as fact) that Álfheim was one of the nine worlds (''heima'') mentioned in stanza&amp;nbsp;2 of the eddic poem ''[[Völuspá]]''.

==Popular culture==
* [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] anglicized ''Álfheim'' as ''Elvenhome'', or ''[[Eldamar]]'' in the [[Quenya|speech of the Elves]]. In his stories, Eldamar lies in a coastal region of the [[Undying Lands]] in the Uttermost West. The High King of the Elves in the West was [[Ingwë]], an echo of the name [[Yngvi]] often found as a name for Frey, whose abode was in ''Álfheim'' according to the ''Grímnismál''.
* In the Japanese light novel and anime series [[Sword Art Online]], the setting for the second and fourth arc is based on Álfheimr.
* In the Japanese game ''[[Bayonetta]]'', there are angelic portals called Alfheim where the player travels to do specific angel slaying for broken witch hearts or moon pearls to increase vitality or witch power. It does not involve elves, however. Only its name is based on Norse mythology.
