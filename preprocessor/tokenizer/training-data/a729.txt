'''Alexander I Balas''' ({{lang-gr|Ἀλέξανδρoς Bάλας}}), was the ruler of the [[Greece|Greek]] [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid kingdom]] in 150–146 BC. Alexander defeated his brother [[Demetrius Soter]] for the crown in 150 BC. Ruling briefly, he lost the crown to his brother during his defeat at the [[Battle of Antioch (145 BC)]] in Syria, dying shortly after.

He is the title character of the [[oratorio]] ''[[Alexander Balus]]'', written in 1747 by [[George Frideric Handel]].

==Biography==
===Early life and reign===
[[Image:AlexanderIBalasAndCleopatraThea.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Alexander Balas and Cleopatra Thea.]]
He was a native of [[İzmir|Smyrna]] of humble origin, but gave himself out to be the son of [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] and [[Laodice IV]] and heir to the Seleucid throne.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Along with his sister [[Laodice VI]], the youngster Alexander was &quot;discovered&quot; by Heracleides, a former minister of Antiochus IV and brother of [[Timarchus]], an usurper in [[Medes|Media]] who had been executed by the reigning king [[Demetrius I of Syria|Demetrius I Soter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Smith |first=Philip Peter |authorlink= |title=Alexander Balas |editor=[[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] |encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] |volume=1 |pages=114–115 |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |location=Boston |year=1867 |url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0123.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606005906/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0123.html |archivedate=2011-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander's claims were recognized by the [[Roman Senate]], [[Ptolemy VI of Egypt|Ptolemy Philometor of Egypt]] and others. He married [[Cleopatra Thea]], a daughter of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]]. At first unsuccessful, Alexander finally defeated Demetrius Soter in 150 BC. Being now master of the empire, he is said to have abandoned himself to a life of debauchery.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Alexander Balas|volume=1|pages=565-566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the truth behind this, the young king was forced to depend heavily on his Ptolemaic support and even struck portraits with the characteristic features of king [[Ptolemy I]].

===Final battle and death===
[[Image:AlexanderI.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Silver coin of Alexander I &quot;Balas&quot;. The Greek inscription reads ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΑΛΕΧΑΝΔΡΟΥ (king Alexander). The date ΓΞΡ is year 163 of the [[Seleucid dynasty|Seleucid era]], corresponding to 150&amp;ndash;149 BC.]]
Demetrius Soter's son [[Demetrius II of Syria|Demetrius II]] profited by the opportunity to regain the throne. Ptolemy Philometor, who was Alexander's father-in-law, went over to his side, and Alexander was defeated in the  [[battle of Antioch (145 BC)]] in Syria,&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; sometimes known as the battle of the Oenoparus.

He fled for refuge to a [[Nabataea]]n prince, who murdered him and sent his head to Ptolemy Philometor, who had been mortally wounded in the engagement.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;
