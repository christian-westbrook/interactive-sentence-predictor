'''Amasis II''' ({{lang-grc|Ἄμασις}}) or '''Ahmose II''' was a [[pharaoh]] (reigned 570 BCE{{snd}}526 BCE) of the [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt]], the successor of [[Apries]] at [[Sais, Egypt|Sais]]. He was the last great ruler of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] before the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] conquest.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;&gt;{{Citation  | last = Lloyd | first = Alan Brian  | contribution = Amasis | year = 1996  | title = [[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]  | editor1-last = Hornblower  | editor1-first = Simon  | editor1-link =Simon Hornblower  | editor2-last = Spawforth  | editor2-first = Anthony  | editor2-link =Anthony Spawforth  | edition = 3rd  | place = Oxford  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]  | isbn = 0-19-521693-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Most of our information about him is derived from [[Herodotus]] (2.161ff) and can only be imperfectly verified by monumental evidence. According to the Greek historian, he was of common origins.&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Mason | first = Charles Peter | authorlink = Charles Peter Mason | title = Amasis (II) | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 1 | pages = 136–137 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0145.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was originally an [[officer]] in the Egyptian army. His birthplace was Siuph at [[Saïs]]. He took part in a general campaign of Pharaoh [[Psamtik II]] in 592 BC in [[Nubia]].

A revolt which broke out among native Egyptian soldiers gave him his opportunity to seize the throne. These troops, returning home from a disastrous military expedition to [[Cyrene (city)|Cyrene]] in Libya, suspected that they had been betrayed in order that [[Apries]], the reigning king, might rule more absolutely by means of his Greek [[mercenaries]]; many Egyptians fully sympathized with them. General Amasis, sent to meet them and quell the revolt, was proclaimed king by the rebels instead, and Apries, who had now to rely entirely on his mercenaries, was defeated.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Amasis|display=Amasis s.v. Amasis II.|volume=1|page=782|first=Francis Llewellyn|last=Griffith|authorlink=Francis Llewellyn Griffith}} This cites:

* [[James Henry Breasted]], ''History and Historical Documents'', vol. iv. p.&amp;nbsp;509
* [[Gaston Maspero]], ''Les Empires''.&lt;/ref&gt; Apries fled to the Babylonians and was killed mounting an invasion of his native homeland in 567 BCE with the aid of a Babylonian army.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} An inscription confirms the struggle between the native Egyptian and the foreign soldiery, and proves that Apries was killed and honourably buried in the third year of Amasis ({{circa|567}} BCE).&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; Amasis then married Chedebnitjerbone II, one of the daughters of his predecessor [[Apries]], in order to legitimise his kingship.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;!--Dodson places her as the wife of Nakhthorheb--&gt;

Some information is known about the family origins of Amasis: his mother was a certain Tashereniset, as a bust of her, today located in the British Museum, shows.&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Dodson &amp; Dyan Hilton, ''The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2004. pp.245 &amp; 247&lt;/ref&gt; A stone block from Mehallet el-Kubra also establishes that his maternal grandmother—Tashereniset's mother—was a certain Tjenmutetj.&lt;ref&gt;Dodson &amp; Hilton, pp.245 &amp; 247&lt;/ref&gt;

His court is relatively well known. The head of the gate guard Ahmose-sa-Neith appears on numerous monuments, including the location of his sarcophagus. He was referenced on monuments of the 30th dynasty and apparently had a special significance in his time.  Wahibre was 'Leader of the southern foreigners' and 'Head of the doors of foreigners', so he was the highest official for border security. Under Amasis the career of the doctor Udjahorresnet began, who was of particular importance to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]]. Several &quot;heads of the fleet&quot; are known. Psamtek Meryneit and Pasherientaihet / Padineith are the only known viziers.

[[Herodotus]] describes how Amasis II would eventually cause a confrontation with the Persian armies. According to Herodotus, Amasis was asked by [[Cambyses II]] or [[Cyrus the Great]] for an Egyptian [[ophthalmologist]] on good terms. Amasis seems to have complied by forcing an Egyptian physician into mandatory labor, causing him to leave his family behind in Egypt and move to Persia in forced exile. In an attempt to exact revenge for this, the physician grew very close to Cambyses and suggested that Cambyses should ask Amasis for a daughter in marriage in order to solidify his bonds with the Egyptians. Cambyses complied and requested a daughter of Amasis for marriage.&lt;ref name=Hero/&gt;

Amasis, worrying that his daughter would be a concubine to the Persian king, refused to give up his offspring; Amasis also was not willing to take on the Persian empire, so he concocted a deception in which he forced the daughter of the ex-pharaoh [[Apries]], whom Herodotus explicitly confirms to have been killed by Amasis, to go to Persia instead of his own offspring.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hero&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author = Herodotus| title = The History of Herodotus Volume I,Book II| url = https://books.google.com/?id=1uQaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA245| year = 1737| publisher = D.

This daughter of Apries was none other than [[Nitetis]], who was, as per Herodotus's account, &quot;tall and beautiful.&quot; Nitetis naturally betrayed Amasis and upon being greeted by the Persian king explained Amasis's trickery and her true origins. This infuriated Cambyses and he vowed to take revenge for it. Amasis died before Cambyses reached him, but his heir and son Psamtik III was defeated by the Persians.&lt;ref name=Hero/&gt;&lt;ref name=Herodotus/&gt;

First, Cambyses signed alliance agreements with the [[Lydia]]n King [[Croesus]] and [[Nabonidus]] the Babylonian king in 542 BC. The actual aim of the agreements was to prevent aid between Egypt and her allies. With both now deprived of Egyptian support, the Persians conquered, first, Croesus's empire in 541 BCE, and, then, the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 539 BCE.

Herodotus also describes that just like his predecessor, Amasis relied on Greek mercenaries and councilmen. One such figure was [[Phanes of Halicarnassus]], who would later on leave Amasis, for reasons Herodotus does not clearly know but suspects were personal between the two figures. Amasis sent one of his [[eunuch]]s to capture Phanes, but the eunuch was bested by the wise councilman and Phanes fled to Persia, meeting up with Cambyses and providing advice in his invasion of Egypt. Egypt was finally lost to the Persians during the [[Battle of Pelusium (525 BC)|battle of Pelusium]] in 525 BC.&lt;ref name=Herodotus/&gt;

==Egypt's wealth==
[[File:Egyptian - Head of King Amasis - Walters 22415.jpg|thumb|This head probably came from a temple statue of Amasis II. He wears the traditional royal nemes head cloth, with a protective uraeus serpent at the brow. Circa 560 BCE. [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].]]
Although Amasis appears first as champion of the disparaged native, he had the good sense to cultivate the friendship of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek world]], and brought Egypt into closer touch with it than ever before. Herodotus relates that under his prudent administration, Egypt reached a new level of wealth; Amasis adorned the temples of [[Lower Egypt]] especially with splendid [[monolith]]ic [[shrine]]s and other monuments (his activity here is proved by existing remains).&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; For example, a temple built by him was excavated at [[Tell Nebesha]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Amasis assigned the commercial colony of [[Naucratis]] on the [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopic]] branch of the [[Nile]] to the Greeks, and when the [[temple of Delphi]] was burnt, he contributed 1,000 [[talent (weight)|talents]] to the rebuilding. He also married a Greek princess named [[Ladice (Cyrenaean Princess)|Ladice]] daughter of King [[Battus III of Cyrene|Battus III]] and made alliances with [[Polycrates]] of Samos and [[Croesus]] of Lydia.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

Under Amasis, Egypt's agricultural based economy reached its zenith. Herodotus, who visited Egypt less than a century after Amasis II's death, writes that:
{{quote|It is said that it was during the reign of Ahmose II (Amasis) that Egypt attained its highest level of prosperity both in respect of what the river gave the land and in respect of what the land yielded to men and that the number of inhabited cities at that time reached in total 20,000&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, (II, 177, 1)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His kingdom consisted probably of Egypt only, as far as the [[First Cataract]], but to this he added [[Cyprus]], and his influence was great in Cyrene.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; In his fourth year ({{circa|lk=no|567}} BCE), Amasis was able to defeat an invasion of Egypt by the Babylonians under [[Nebuchadnezzar II]]; henceforth, the Babylonians experienced sufficient difficulties controlling their empire that they were forced to abandon future attacks against Amasis.&lt;ref&gt;Alan B. Lloyd, 'The Late Period' in The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt (ed. Ian Shaw), Oxford Univ. Press 2002 paperback, pp.381-82&lt;/ref&gt; However, Amasis was later faced with a more formidable enemy with the rise of Persia under [[Cyrus II of Persia|Cyrus]] who ascended to the throne in 559 BCE; his final years were preoccupied by the threat of the impending Persian onslaught against Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloyd.(2002)p.382&quot;&gt;Lloyd. (2002) p.382&lt;/ref&gt; With great strategic skill, Cyrus had destroyed Lydia in 546 BCE and finally defeated the Babylonians in 538 BCE which left Amasis with no major Near Eastern allies to counter Persia's increasing military might.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloyd.(2002)p.382&quot;/&gt; Amasis reacted by cultivating closer ties with the Greek states to counter the future Persian invasion into Egypt but was fortunate to have died in 526 BCE shortly before the Persians attacked.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloyd.(2002)p.382&quot;/&gt; The final assault instead fell upon his son [[Psamtik III]], whom the Persians defeated in 525 BCE after a reign of only six months.{{sfn|Griffith|1911}}

==Tomb and desecration==
Amasis II died in 526 BC. He was buried at the royal necropolis of Sais, and while his tomb was never discovered, Herodotus describes it for us:

{{quote|[It is] a great cloistered building of stone, decorated with pillars carved in the imitation of palm-trees, and other costly ornaments. Within the cloister is a chamber with double doors, and behind the doors stands the sepulchre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/amasis.htm Amasis]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Herodotus also relates the desecration of Ahmose II/Amasis' mummy when the Persian king Cambyses conquered Egypt and thus ended the 26th Saite dynasty:
{{quote|[N]o sooner did [... Cambyses] enter the palace of Amasis that he gave orders for his [Amasis's] body to be taken from the tomb where it lay. This done, he proceeded to have it treated with every possible indignity, such as beating it with whips, sticking it with goads, and plucking its hairs. [... A]s the body had been embalmed and would not fall to pieces under the blows, Cambyses had it burned.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, The Histories, Book III, Chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Later reputation==

From the fifth century BCE, there is evidence of stories circulating about Amasis, in Egyptian sources (including a demotic papyrus of the third century BCE), [[Herodotus]], [[Hellanicus of Lesbos|Hellanikos]], and [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Convivium Septem Sapientium]]''. 'In those tales Amasis was presented as a non-conventional Pharaoh, behaving in ways unbecoming to a king but gifted with practical wisdom and cunning, a trickster on the trone or a kind of comic Egyptian [[Solomon]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Ioannis M. Konstantakos, 'Trial by Riddle: The Testing of the Counsellor and the Contest of Kings in the Legend of Amasis and Bias', ''Classica et Mediaevalia'', 55 (2004), 85-137 (p. 90).&lt;/ref&gt;
