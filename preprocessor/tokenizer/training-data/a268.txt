A '''motor neuron disease''' ('''MND''') is any of several [[neurological disorder]]s that selectively affect [[motor neuron]]s, the cells that control [[voluntary muscles]] of the body. They include [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), [[hereditary spastic paraplegia]] (HSP), [[primary lateral sclerosis]] (PLS), [[progressive muscular atrophy]] (PMA), [[progressive bulbar palsy]] (PBP) and [[pseudobulbar palsy]]. [[Spinal muscular atrophies]] (SMA) are sometimes included in the group by some neurologists but it is different disease with clear genetic cause.&lt;ref name=NINDS2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/motor_neuron_diseases/detail_motor_neuron_diseases.htm|title=Motor Neuron Diseases Fact Sheet: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)|publisher=www.ninds.nih.gov|accessdate=7 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413093035/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/motor_neuron_diseases/detail_motor_neuron_diseases.htm|archive-date=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kimura|first1=Jun|title=Electrodiagnosis in Diseases of Nerve and Muscle: Principles and Practice|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199969296|page=599|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=semMBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA599|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are [[neurodegenerative]] in nature and cause increasing disability and eventually, death.&lt;ref name=El2008/&gt;

==Terminology==
In the United States, the term is often used to denote ALS, the most common disorder in the group.&lt;ref name=NINDS2014/&gt; In the United Kingdom, the term is also spelt ''motor neurone disease'' (MND) and is sometimes used for the entire group;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mndassociation.org/what-is-mnd/different-types-of-mnd/ |title=Different types of MND |website=motor neurone disease association|date=  |author= |accessdate= 4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but mostly it refers to ALS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207121513/http://www.mndassociation.org:80/what-is-mnd/different-types-of-mnd/ |title=About MND |website=motor neurone disease association|date=  |author= |accessdate= 4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While MND refers to a specific subset of similar diseases, there are numerous other diseases of [[motor neuron]]s that are referred to collectively as &quot;motor neuron disorders&quot;, for instance disease belonging to [[spinal muscular atrophies]].&lt;ref name=El2008&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellison|first1=edited by Seth Love, David N. Louis, David W.|title=Greenfield's neuropathology|date=2008|publisher=Hodder Arnold|location=London|isbn=9780340906811|page=947|edition=8th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nrEWkAc7W7IC&amp;pg=PA947}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are not classified as &quot;motor neuron diseases&quot; by the [[ICD-10|tenth International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] (ICD-10), which is the definition followed in this article.

== Classification ==

Motor neuron diseases affect either [[upper motor neuron]]s (UMN) or [[lower motor neuron]]s (LMN), or both:
