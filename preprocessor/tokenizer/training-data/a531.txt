=== Iowa State University ===
Iowa State University of Science and Technology, more commonly known as Iowa State University (ISU), is a public [[land-grant universities|land-grant]] and [[space-grant colleges|space-grant]] research university located in Ames. Iowa State has produced a number of astronauts, scientists, [[Nobel laureates]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nobel Prize winner returns to Iowa State to talk about the experience|url = http://www.radioiowa.com/2012/02/14/nobel-prize-winner-returns-to-iowa-state-to-talk-about-the-experience/|website = Radio Iowa|access-date = 2016-01-15|first = Dar|last = Danielson}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pulitzer Prize]] winners, and a variety of other notable individuals in their respective fields.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} Until 1945 it was known as the Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts. The university is a member of the [[American Association of Universities]] and the [[Big 12 Conference]].

In 1856, the [[Iowa General Assembly]] enacted legislation to establish the State Agricultural College and Model Farm. [[Story County, Iowa|Story County]] was chosen as the location on June 21, 1859, from proposals by [[Johnson County, Iowa|Johnson]], [[Kossuth County, Iowa|Kossuth]], [[Marshall County, Iowa|Marshall]], [[Polk County, Iowa|Polk]], and [[Story County, Iowa|Story]] counties. When Iowa accepted the provisions of the [[Morrill Act of 1862]], Iowa State became the first institution in nation designated as a [[land-grant]] college. The institution was coeducational from the first preparatory class admitted in 1868. The formal admitting of students began the following year, and the first graduating class of 1872 consisted of 24 men and 2 women.&lt;ref name=&quot;lib.iastate.edu&quot;/&gt;

The first building on the Iowa State campus was [[Farm House Museum|Farm House]]. Built in the 1860s, it currently serves as a museum and [[National Historic Landmark]]. Today, Iowa State has over 60 notable buildings, including [[Beardshear Hall]], [[Buildings of Iowa State University#Morrill Hall|Morrill Hall]], [[Memorial Union (Iowa State University)|Memorial Union]], [[Catt Hall]], Curtiss Hall, [[Carver Hall]], Parks Library, the [[Campanile]], [[Hilton Coliseum]], C.Y. Stephens Auditorium, [[Buildings of Iowa State University#Fisher Theater|Fisher Theater]], [[Jack Trice Stadium]], Lied Recreation Center, numerous residence halls, and many buildings specific to ISU's many different majors and colleges. Iowa State is home to 36,321 students (Fall 2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.registrar.iastate.edu/stats/stats-s12.pdf |title=FINAL ENROLLMENT – SPRING 2012 |publisher=ISU Registrar's Office |accessdate=March 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501194155/http://www.registrar.iastate.edu/stats/stats-s12.pdf |archivedate=May 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and makes up approximately one half of the city's population.

The official mascot for ISU is [[Cy the Cardinal]]. The official school colors are cardinal and gold. The [[Iowa State Cyclones]] play in the [[NCAA]]'s Division I-A as a member of the [[Big 12 Conference]].

== Infrastructure ==

=== Transportation ===
[[File:Power plant in Ames.jpg|thumb|right|upright|City power plant at night blows steam into the air.]]
The town is served by [[U.S. Route 30|U.S. Highways 30]] and [[U.S. Route 69|69]] and [[Interstate 35]]. Ames is the only town in Iowa with a population of greater than 50,000 that does not have a state highway serving it.  {{As of|2015}}, Ames does not have any [[roundabout]]s, though a project to create three roundabouts is planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=University Boulevard plans include Ames' first roundabouts|last=Erickson|first=Melissa|newspaper=[[Ames Tribune]]|pages=A1, A4|date=January 14, 2015|volume=147|number=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ames was serviced by the Fort Dodge, Des Moines and Southern Railroad via a branch from [[Kelley, Iowa|Kelley]] to Iowa State University and to downtown Ames. The tracks were removed in the 1960s. The [[Chicago and North Western Transportation Company]] twin mainline runs east and west bisecting the town and running just south of the downtown business district. The [[C&amp;NW]] used to operate a branch to [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]]. This line was removed in the 1980s when the Spine Line through [[Nevada, Iowa|Nevada]] was purchased from the [[Rock Island Railroad]] after its bankruptcy. The [[Union Pacific]], successor to the C&amp;NW, still runs 60–70 trains a day through Ames on twin mainlines, which leads to some traffic delays. There is also a branch to [[Eagle Grove, Iowa|Eagle Grove]] that leaves Ames to the north. The Union Pacific maintains a small yard called Ames Yard east of Ames between Ames and Nevada. Ames has been testing automatic train horns at several of its crossings. These directional horns which are focused down the streets are activated when the crossing signals turn on and are shut off after the train crosses the crossing. This system cancels out the need for the trains to blow their horns. Train noise had been a problem in the residential areas to the west and northwest of downtown.

[[Ames Municipal Airport]] is located {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} southeast of the city. The current (and only) [[Fixed-Base Operation|FBO]] is Hap's Air Service, a company which has been based at the airport since 1975. The airport has two runways – 01/19, which is {{convert|5700|x|100|ft}}, and 13/31, which is {{convert|3492|x|100|ft}}.

The City of Ames offers a transit system throughout town, called [[CyRide]], that is funded jointly by Iowa State University, the ISU Government of the Student Body, and the City of Ames. Rider fares are subsidized through this funding, and are free for children under five. Students pay a set cost as part of their tuition.

Ames has the headquarters of the [[Iowa Department of Transportation]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.iowadot.gov/where.htm Where We Are Located].&quot; [[Iowa Department of Transportation]]. Retrieved October 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health care ===
Ames is served by [[Mary Greeley Medical Center]], a 220-bed regional referral hospital which is adjacent to McFarland Clinic PC, central Iowa's largest physician-owned multi-specialty clinic, and also Iowa Heart Center.

== Other topics ==

=== Politics ===
Iowa is a political &quot;[[battleground state]]&quot; that has trended slightly [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] in recent years, and Ames, like [[Iowa City]], also trends Democratic. Because Iowa is the first caucus state and Ames is a [[college town]], it is the site of many political appearances, debates and events, especially during election years.

From 1979 through 2011, Ames was the location of the [[Ames Straw Poll]], which was held every August prior to a presidential election year in which the Republican presidential nomination was undecided (meaning there was no Republican president running for re-election—as in 2011, 2007, 1999, 1995, 1987, and 1979). The poll would gauge support for the various Republican candidates amongst attendees of a [[fundraising]] dinner benefiting the [[Republican Party of Iowa|Iowa Republican Party]]. The straw poll was frequently seen by national media and party insiders as a first test of organizational strength in Iowa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/08/14/iowa.saturday.02/|title=Iowa Saturday|publisher=CNN|date=August 14, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the straw poll was to be moved to nearby Boone before the Iowa Republican Party eventually decided to cancel it altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new|url = http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/06/12/iowa-straw-poll/71116276/|title=The Iowa Straw Poll is dead|publisher=The Des Moines Register|date=June 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
