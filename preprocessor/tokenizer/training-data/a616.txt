An '''amide''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|m|aɪ|d}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|m|ɪ|d}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|m|aɪ|d}}),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/amide&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{AHDict|amide}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/amide&lt;/ref&gt; also known as an '''acid amide''', is a compound with the [[functional group]] R&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;E(O)&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;NR′&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (R and R′ refer to [[hydrogen|H]] or [[organic compound|organic]] groups). Most common are [[carboxamide]]s (organic amides) (''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, E&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;C, ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1), but many other important types of amides are known, including [[phosphoramide]]s (''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, E&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;P, ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and many related formulas) and [[Sulfonamide (chemistry)|sulfonamide]]s (E&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;S, ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2).&lt;ref&gt;{{goldbookref|file=A00266|title=amides}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term amide refers both to ''classes of compounds'' and to the ''[[functional group]]'' (R&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;E(O)&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;NR′&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) within those compounds.

Amide can '''also''' refer to the [[conjugate base]] of [[ammonia]] (the [[amidogen|anion H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]]) or of an organic [[amine]] (an anion R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). For discussion of these &quot;[[anionic]] amides&quot;, see [[Metal amides#Alkali metal amides|Alkali metal amides]].

The remainder of this article is about the [[carbonyl]]–[[nitrogen]] sense of ''amide''.

==Structure and bonding==
The simplest amides are derivatives of [[ammonia]] wherein one hydrogen atom has been replaced by an [[acyl]] group. The ensemble is generally represented as RC(O)NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and is described as a primary amide. Closely related and even more numerous are secondary amides which can be derived from [[primary amine]]s (R′NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and have the formula RC(O)NHR′. Tertiary amides are commonly derived from [[secondary amine]]s (R′R″NH) and have the general structure RC(O)NR′R″. Amides are usually regarded as derivatives of [[carboxylic acid]]s in which the [[hydroxyl]] group has been replaced by an amine or ammonia.
:[[Image:AmideResonance.png|300px|Amide resonance:]]
The lone pair of [[electron]]s on the [[nitrogen]] is delocalized into the carbonyl, thus forming a partial [[double bond]] between N and the [[carbonyl]] [[carbon]]. Consequently, the nitrogen in amides is not pyramidal. It is estimated that acetamide is described by [[resonance structure]] A for 62% and by B for 28% (which does not sum to 100% because there are additional resonance forms that are not depicted in the above Figure).&lt;ref name = Kemnitz&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja0663024|title=&quot;Amide Resonance&quot; Correlates with a Breadth of C−N Rotation Barriers|year=2007|last1=Kemnitz|first1=Carl R.|last2=Loewen|first2=Mark J.|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=129|issue=9|pages=2521–8|pmid=17295481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
{{Main article|IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry#Amines and amides}}
In the usual nomenclature, one adds the term &quot;amide&quot; to the stem of the parent acid's name. For instance, the amide derived from [[acetic acid]] is named [[acetamide]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CONH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). IUPAC recommends [[ethanamide]], but this and related formal names are rarely encountered. When the amide is derived from a primary or secondary amine, the substituents on nitrogen are indicated first in the name. Thus, the amide formed from [[dimethylamine]] and [[acetic acid]] is ''N'',''N''-dimethylacetamide (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CONMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where Me = CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Usually even this name is simplified to [[dimethylacetamide]]. Cyclic amides are called [[lactam]]s; they are necessarily secondary or tertiary amides. Functional groups consisting of –P(O)NR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and –SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are [[phosphonamides]] and [[sulfonamide (chemistry)|sulfonamide]]s, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Organic Chemistry IUPAC Nomenclature. Rules C-821. Amides http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/79/r79_540.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pronunciation===
Some chemists make a pronunciation distinction between the two, saying {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|m|iː|d}} for the [[carbonyl]]–[[nitrogen]] compound and {{IPAc-en|audio=En-uk-amide.ogg|ˈ|eɪ|m|aɪ|d}} {{contradict-inline|date=August 2012}} for the [[anion]]. Others replace one of these with {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|m|ᵻ|d}}, while still others pronounce both {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|m|ᵻ|d}}, making them [[homonym]]s.

==Properties==

===Basicity===
Compared to [[amine]]s, amides are very weak [[Base (chemistry)|base]]s. While the [[conjugate acid]] of an [[amine]] has a [[pKa|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] of about 9.5, the [[conjugate acid]] of an amide has a p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; around −0.5. Therefore, amides don't have as clearly noticeable [[acid–base]] properties in [[water]]. This relative lack of basicity is explained by the [[electron]]-withdrawing nature of the [[carbonyl group]] where the lone pair of [[electron]]s on the [[nitrogen]] is delocalized by [[resonance (chemistry)|resonance]]. On the other hand, amides are much stronger [[Base (chemistry)|base]]s than [[carboxylic acid]]s, [[ester]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, and [[ketone]]s (their conjugate acids' p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;s are between −6 and −10). It is estimated [[in silico]] that [[acetamide]] is represented by [[resonance structure]] A for 62% and by B for 28%.&lt;ref name = Kemnitz/&gt; Resonance is largely prevented in the very strained [[quinuclidone]].

Because of the greater electronegativity of oxygen, the carbonyl (C=O) is a stronger dipole than the N–C dipole. The presence of a C=O dipole and, to a lesser extent a N–C dipole, allows amides to act as H-bond acceptors. In primary and secondary amides, the presence of N–H dipoles allows amides to function as H-bond donors as well. Thus amides can participate in hydrogen bonding with water and other protic solvents; the oxygen atom can accept hydrogen bonds from water and the N–H hydrogen atoms can donate H-bonds. As a result of interactions such as these, the water solubility of amides is greater than that of corresponding hydrocarbons.

The proton of a primary or secondary amide does not dissociate readily under normal conditions; its p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is usually well above 15. Conversely, under extremely acidic conditions, the carbonyl [[oxygen]] can become protonated with a p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of roughly −1.

===Solubility===
The [[Solubility|solubilities]] of amides and esters are roughly comparable. Typically amides are less soluble than comparable amines and carboxylic acids since these compounds can both donate and accept hydrogen bonds. Tertiary amides, with the important exception of [[Dimethylformamide|''N'',''N''-dimethylformamide]], exhibit low solubility in water.

==Characterization==
The presence of the functional group is generally easily established, at least in small molecules. They are the most common non-basic functional group. They can be distinguished from nitro and cyano groups by their [[IR spectroscopy|IR spectra]]. Amides exhibit a moderately intense ''ν''&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; band near 1650&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. By &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H [[NMR spectroscopy]], CON'''H'''R signals occur at low fields. In X-ray crystallography, the C(O)N center together with the three immediately adjacent atoms characteristically define a plane.

==Applications and occurrence==
Amides are pervasive in nature and technology as structural materials. The amide linkage is easily formed, confers structural rigidity, and resists [[hydrolysis]]. [[Nylon]]s are [[polyamide]]s, as are the very resilient materials [[Aramid]], [[Twaron]], and [[Kevlar]]. Amide linkages constitute a defining molecular feature of [[protein]]s, the [[secondary structure]] of which is due in part to the [[hydrogen bonding]] abilities of amides. Amide linkages in a [[biochemistry|biochemical]] context are called [[peptide bond]]s when they occur in the main chain of a protein and [[isopeptide bond]]s when they occur to a side-chain of the protein. Proteins can have structural roles, such as in [[hair]] or [[spider silk]], but also nearly all [[enzyme]]s are proteins. Low molecular weight amides, such as [[dimethylformamide]] (HC(O)N(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), are common solvents. Many drugs are amides, including [[paracetamol]], [[penicillin]] and [[LSD]]. Moreover, plant ''N''-alkylamides have a wide range of biological functionalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jep.2012.05.038|title=Alkamid database: Chemistry, occurrence and functionality of plant ''N''-alkylamides|year=2012|last1=Boonen|first1=Jente|last2=Bronselaer|first2=Antoon|last3=Nielandt|first3=Joachim|last4=Veryser|first4=Lieselotte|last5=De Tré|first5=Guy|last6=De Spiegeleer|first6=Bart|journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology|volume=142|issue=3|pages=563–90|pmid=22659196|hdl=1854/LU-2133714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amide synthesis==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Organic reaction]] --&gt;
Many methods exist in amide synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Amide bond formation and peptide coupling |first1=Christian A. G. N. |last1=Montalbetti |first2=Virginie |last2=Falque |journal=Tetrahedron |volume=61 |issue=46 |date=14 November 2005 |pages=10827–10852 |doi=10.1016/j.tet.2005.08.031}}&lt;/ref&gt; On paper, the simplest method for making amides is by coupling a [[carboxylic acid]] with an [[amine]]. In general this reaction is thermodynamically favorable, however it suffers from a high [[activation energy]], largely due to the amine first deprotonating the carboxylic acid, which reduces its reactivity. As such the direct reaction often requires high temperatures.

:RCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H + R′R″NH {{eqm}} {{chem|RCO|2|−}} + {{chem|R′R″NH|2|+}} {{eqm}} RC(O)NR′R″ + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Many methods are known for driving the equilibrium to the right. For the most part these reactions involve &quot;activating&quot; the carboxylic acid by first converting it to a better [[electrophile]]; such as [[ester]]s, [[acid chloride]]s ([[Schotten-Baumann reaction]]) or [[anhydride]]s ([[Lumière–Barbier method]]). Conventional methods in [[peptide synthesis]] use coupling agents such as [[HATU]], [[Hydroxybenzotriazole|HOBt]], or  [[PyBOP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Amide bond formation: beyond the myth of coupling reagents |first1=Eric |last1=Valeur |first2=Mark |last2=Bradley |journal=Chem.

===Other methods===
The seemingly simple direct reaction between an [[alcohol]] and an [[amine]] to an amide was not tried until 2007 when a special [[ruthenium]]-based [[catalyst]] was reported to be effective in a so-called dehydrogenative acylation:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1145295|title=Direct Synthesis of Amides from Alcohols and Amines with Liberation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|year=2007|last1=Gunanathan|first1=C.|last2=Ben-David|first2=Y.|last3=Milstein|first3=D.|journal=Science|volume=317|issue=5839|pages=790–2|pmid=17690291|bibcode=2007Sci...317..790G}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[Image:DehydrogenativeAmidation.svg|500px|Synthesis of amides from alcohols and amines with liberation of [[hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].]]

The generation of hydrogen gas compensates for unfavorable thermodynamics. The reaction is believed to proceed by one dehydrogenation of the alcohol to the [[aldehyde]] followed by formation of a [[hemiaminal]] and the after a second dehydrogenation to the amide. Elimination of water in the hemiaminal to the imine is not observed.

A direct generation of amide from aryl (heteroaryl) alkyl ketones has been accomplished via copper(II) catalyzed
C-C bond cleavage in the presence of diisopropylamine at moderate temperature. The transformation steps for
amide formation comprise catalytic generation of α-bromo carbonyl species followed by nucleophilic displacement
of bromide with sodium azide in the presence of diisopropylamine. The final step involves the formation of imine
by heating in situ followed by hydrolysis to give the related amide.&lt;ref&gt;A novel copper-catalyzed C-C bond cleavage of aryl (heteroaryl) alkyl ketones for C-N bond formation, EJPMR, 2017,4(2), 126-151, http://www.ejpmr.com/admin/assets/article_issue/1486098724.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Amides undergo many chemical reactions, although they are less reactive than esters.  Amides hydrolyse in hot [[alkali]] as well as in strong [[acid]]ic conditions. Acidic conditions yield the carboxylic acid and the ammonium ion while basic hydrolysis yield the carboxylate ion and ammonia. Amides are also versatile precursors to many other [[functional group]]s.Electrophiles attack the [[carbonyl]] oxygen.  This step often precedes hydrolysis, which is catalyzed by both [[Bronsted acid]]s and [[Lewis acid]]s.   Enzymes, e.g. [[peptidase]]s and artificial catalysts, are known to accelerate the hydrolysis reactions.
