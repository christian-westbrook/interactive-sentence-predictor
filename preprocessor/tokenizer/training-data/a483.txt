'''Anguilla''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|ŋ|ˈ|ɡ|w|ɪ|l|ə}} {{respell|ang|GWIL|ə}}) is a [[British Overseas Territories|British overseas territory]] in the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Introduction ::Anguilla&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction ::Anguilla|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/av.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most northerly of the [[Leeward Islands]] in the [[Lesser Antilles]], lying east of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Virgin Islands]] and directly north of [[Saint Martin]]. The territory consists of the main island of Anguilla, approximately 16 miles (26&amp;nbsp;km) long by 3 miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) wide at its widest point, together with a number of much smaller islands and [[cay]]s with no permanent population. The island's capital is [[The Valley, Anguilla|The Valley]]. The total land area of the territory is 35 square miles (90&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;),&lt;ref name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Anguilla Facts|url=http://www.gov.ai/anguillafacts.php|publisher=Government of Anguilla|accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a population of approximately {{UN_Population|Anguilla}} ({{UN_Population|Year}} estimate).

Anguilla has become a popular [[tax haven]], having no capital gains, estate, profit or other forms of direct taxation on either individuals or corporations. In April 2011, faced with a mounting deficit, it introduced a 3% &quot;Interim Stabilisation Levy&quot;, Anguilla's first form of [[income tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=KPMG |url=http://www.kpmg.com/global/en/issuesandinsights/articlespublications/taxation-international-executives/anguilla/pages/default.aspx|title=Tax TIES: Anguilla – Overview and introduction |publisher=KPMG |date= |accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 September 2017, the Category 5 [[Hurricane Irma]] hit the island. As of the next day, one death had been reported; the island also sustained extensive damage to many buildings, including government ones, as well as its electricity infrastructure and water supply. The UK government summarized this as &quot;severe and in places critical&quot; damage.&lt;ref&gt; http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/damage-hurricane-irma-caribbean-49703893&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, [[Hurricane Jose (2017)|Hurricane Jose]] largely bypassed Anguilla.&lt;ref&gt;http://smn-news.com/st-maarten-st-martin-news/27019-anguilla-spared-by-hurricane-jose-accelerates-recovery-from-irma.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Etymology}}

== Name ==
The name Anguilla is an [[Anglicization of names|anglicised]] or [[Latinization of names|latinate]] form of earlier Spanish ''{{lang|es|anguila}}'' meaning &quot;[[eel]]&quot; in reference to the island's shape.{{sfnp|Martin|1839}} It is believed by most sources to have been named by [[Christopher Columbus]].{{sfnp|Law|1999}} For similar reasons, it was also known as ''Snake'' or ''Snake Island''.{{sfnp|Martin|1839}}{{sfnp|EB|1878}}{{sfnp|EB|1911}}

== History ==
{{Main article|History of Anguilla}}
[[File:Wallblake House, The Valley.jpg|thumb|[[Wallblake House]]]]
Anguilla was first settled by Indigenous Amerindian peoples who migrated from South America. The earliest Native American artefacts found on Anguilla have been dated to around 1300&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}; remains of settlements date from {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;600.&lt;ref&gt;''Caribbean Islands'', Sarah Cameron (Footprint Travel Guides), p. 466 ([https://books.google.com/?id=G74-rZzX64cC Google Books])&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arawak]] name for the island seems to have been ''Malliouhana''. The date of European colonisation is uncertain: some sources claim that [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] sighted the island during his second voyage in 1493, while others state that the island's first European explorer was the [[Kingdom of France|French]] Huguenot nobleman and merchant mariner [[René Goulaine de Laudonnière]] in 1564.&lt;ref name=gov&gt;{{citation |contribution=Anguilla's History |contribution-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813051037/http://gov.ai/elections/anguillahistory.htm |publisher=Government of Anguilla |title=The Anguilla House of Assembly Elections&lt;!--sic--&gt; |date=2007 |accessdate=9 June 2015 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional accounts state that Anguilla was first colonised by [[Kingdom of England|English]] settlers from [[Saint Kitts]] beginning in 1650.{{sfnp|Martin|1839}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Historical Geography of the British Colonies: The West Indies|author=Charles Prestwood Lucas|page=143|isbn=978-1-4590-0868-7|publisher=General Books LLC|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this early colonial period, however, Anguilla sometimes served as a place of refuge and recent scholarship focused on Anguilla has placed greater significance on other Europeans and [[creole peoples|creoles]] migrating from [[St. Kitts|St. Christopher]],&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, V.O. 1998. St. Kitts:  The Launching Pad for Leeward Islands Creoles. In St. Kitts and the Atlantic Creoles, the Texts of Samuel Augustus Mathews in Perspective, P. Baker and A. Bruyn (eds.). London:  University of Westminster Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbados]], [[Nevis]] and [[Antigua]]. The French temporarily took over the island in 1666 but returned it to English control under the terms of the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] the next year. A Major John Scott who visited in September 1667, wrote of leaving the island &quot;in good condition&quot; and noted that in July 1668, &quot;200 or 300 people fled thither in time of war&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;British Colonial and State Papers 1661–1668, 16 November 1667 and 9 July 1668.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is likely that some of these early Europeans brought enslaved Africans with them. Historians confirm that [[Atlantic slave trade|African slaves]] lived in the region in the early 17th century. For example, Africans from [[Senegal]] lived in St. Christopher in 1626. By 1672 a slave depot existed on the island of Nevis, serving the [[Leeward Islands]]. While the time of African arrival in Anguilla is difficult to place precisely, archival evidence indicates a substantial African presence of at least 100 slaves by 1683. These seem to have come from Central Africa as well as West Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walicek, Don E 2009. pp. 349-372&quot;&gt;Walicek, Don E.  2009. &quot;The Founder Principle and Anguilla's Homestead Society,&quot; Gradual Creolization: Studies Celebrating Jacques Arends, ed. by M. van den Berg, H. Cardoso, and R. Selbach. (Creole Language Library Series 34), Amsterdam: John Benjamins, pp. 349–372.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts by the French to capture the island during the [[War of Austrian Succession]] ([[Battle of Anguilla|1745]]) and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1796) ended in failure.&lt;ref name=gov/&gt;

During the early colonial period, Anguilla was administered by the British through Antigua; in 1825, it was placed under the administrative control of nearby Saint Kitts.&lt;ref name=gov/&gt; In 1967, Britain granted Saint Kitts and [[Nevis]] full internal autonomy. Anguilla was also incorporated into the new unified dependency, named [[Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla]], against the wishes of many Anguillians. This led to two Anguillian Revolutions in 1967 and 1969 headed by Atlin Harrigan&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gov.ai/documents/budget/Budget_2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ronald Webster]]. The island briefly operated as the independent &quot;[[Republic of Anguilla]]&quot;. The goal of the revolution was not independence per se, but rather independence from Saint Kitts and Nevis and a return to being a British colony. British authority was fully restored in July 1971; in 1980, Anguilla was finally allowed to secede from Saint Kitts and Nevis and become a separate British [[Crown colony]] (now a [[British overseas territory]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Introduction ::Anguilla&quot;/&gt;

===Political system===
{{Main article|Politics of Anguilla}}
{{See also|Law of Anguilla}}
Anguilla is an internally self-governing [[British overseas territory|overseas territory]] of the United Kingdom. Its politics take place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[Dependent territory|dependency]], whereby the [[Chief Minister]] is the [[head of government]], and of a [[wikt:pluriform|pluriform]] multi-party system.

The [[United Nations Committee on Decolonization]] includes Anguilla on the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]]. The territory's constitution is Anguilla Constitutional Order 1 April 1982 (amended 1990). [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Anguilla House of Assembly|House of Assembly]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. {{clear left}}

===Defence===
As a dependency of the UK, the UK is responsible for Anguilla's military defence, although there are no active [[garrisons]] or armed forces present. Anguilla has a small [[marine police]] force, comprising around 32 personnel, which operates one M160-class fast [[patrol boat]].

== Population ==

=== Demographics ===
{{Main article|Demographics of Anguilla}}
The majority of residents (90.08%) are black, the descendants of slaves transported from Africa. Minorities include whites at 3.74% and people of mixed race at 4.65% (figures from 2001 census).

72% of the population is Anguillian while 28% is non-Anguillian (2001 census). Of the non-Anguillian population, many are citizens of the United States, United Kingdom, [[St Kitts &amp; Nevis]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Nigeria]].

2006 and 2007 saw an influx of large numbers of Chinese, Indian and [[Mexican people|Mexican]] workers, brought in as labour for major tourist developments due to the local population not being large enough to support the labour requirements.

=== Religion ===
Christian churches did not have a consistent or strong presence during the initial period of English colonisation. Spiritual and religious practices of Europeans and Africans tended to reflect their regional origins. As early as 1813, Christian ministers formally ministered to enslaved Africans and promoted literacy among converts.&lt;ref&gt;Walicek, Don E. 2011. &quot;Christianity, Literacy, and Creolization in Nineteenth-Century Anguilla.&quot; In Anansi's Defiant Webs, Contact, Continuity, Convergence, and Complexity in the Language, Literatures and Cultures of the Greater Caribbean, ed. by N. Faraclas, R. Severing, et al. Willemstad: University of Curaçao and Fundashon pa Planifikashon di Idioma, pp. 181–189.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wesleyan]] (Methodist) [[Missionary Society of England]] built churches and schools in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, S. Wilfred (2003). Bethel- the road – and due west. In Wilbert Forker (Ed.), Born in slavery: A story of Methodism in Anguilla and its influence in the Caribbean (pp. 20–29). Edinburgh: Dunedin Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2001 census, Christianity is Anguilla's predominant religion, with 29 percent of the population practising [[Anglicanism]]. Another 23.9 percent are [[Methodist]]. Other churches on the island include [[Seventh-day Adventist]], [[Baptist]], [[Roman Catholic]] (served by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint John's - Basseterre]], with see at Saint John on [[Antigua and Barbuda]]) and a community of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (0.7%).&lt;ref name=&quot;statistics census&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gov.ai/statistics/census/Demography%20&amp;%20Culture%20tables.htm|title=Persons by Religion, Census 1992 and 2001 (Table 14)|publisher=Statistics Department of Anguilla|accessdate=2008-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1992 and 2001 the number of followers of the [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)|Church of God]] and [[Pentecostals]] increased considerably. There are at least 15 churches on the island. Although a minority on the island, it is an important location to followers of [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarian]] religion—Anguilla is the birthplace of [[Robert Athlyi Rogers]], author of the ''[[Holy Piby]]'' which has had a strong influence on Rastafarian beliefs. Various other religions are practised as well. More recently, a Muslim cultural center has opened on the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;statistics census&quot;/&gt;

=== Languages ===
{{Main article|Anguillian Creole}}
[[File:Sandy Ground Anguilla.jpg|thumb|Overlooking [[Sandy Ground, Anguilla|Sandy Ground]], Anguilla]]
Today most people in Anguilla speak a British-influenced variety of standard English. Other languages are also spoken on the island, including varieties of Spanish, Chinese and the languages of other immigrants. However, the most common language other than Standard English is the island's own English-lexifier Creole language (not to be confused with [[Antillean Creole]] ('French Creole'), spoken in French islands such as [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]]). It is referred to locally by terms such as &quot;dialect&quot; (pronounced &quot;dialek&quot;), Anguilla Talk or &quot;Anguillian&quot;. It has its main roots in early varieties of English and West African languages, and is similar to the dialects spoken in English-speaking islands throughout the Eastern Caribbean, in terms of its structural features and to the extent of being considered one single language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=aig|title=Antigua and Barbuda Creole English|work=Ethnologue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists who are interested in the origins of Anguillian and other Caribbean Creoles point out that some of its grammatical features can be traced to African languages while others can be traced to European languages. Three areas have been identified as significant for the identification of the linguistic origins of those forced migrants who arrived before 1710: the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]], the [[Slave Coast]] and the Windward Coast.&lt;ref&gt;Singler, John. 1993. African influence upon Afro-American language varieties: A consideration of sociohistorical factors.  In Africanisms in Afro-American language varieties, S. Mufwene and n. Condon (eds.), 235–253.  Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociohistorical information from Anguilla's archives suggest that Africans and Europeans formed two distinct, but perhaps overlapping speech communities in the early phases of the island's colonisation. &quot;Anguillian&quot; is believed to have emerged as the language of the masses as time passed, slavery was abolished and locals began to see themselves as &quot;belonging&quot; to Anguillian society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walicek, Don E 2009. pp. 349-372&quot;/&gt;

The Anguilla National Trust (ANT) was established in 1988 and opened its offices in 1993 charged with the responsibility of preserving the heritage of the island, including its cultural heritage. The Trust has programmes encouraging Anguillian writers and the preservation of the island's history. In 2015, ''Where I See The Sun – Contemporary Poetry in Anguilla'' A New Anthology by [[Lasana M. Sekou]] was published by House of Nehesi Publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanguillian.com/2015/05/where-i-see-the-sun-anthology-available-in-anguilla/|title=&quot;WHERE I SEE THE SUN&quot; ANTHOLOGY AVAILABLE IN ANGUILLA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the forty three poets in the unprecedented collection are Rita Celestine-Carty, [[Bankie Banx]], John T. Harrigan, [[Patricia J. Adams]], Fabian Fahie, Dr. Oluwakemi Linda Banks, and Reuel Ben Lewi.&lt;ref&gt;http://soualiganewsday.com/local/soualiga-newsday-features/item/3890-think-and-know-where-i-see-the-sun-–-contemporary-poetry-in-anguilla.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The island's cultural history begins with the [[Taíno people|Taino]] Native Americans. Artifacts have been found around the island, telling of life before European settlers arrived by the [[Arawak]] and [[Island Caribs|Carib]] peoples.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hailey et al. 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hailey|first1=Adrian|last2=Wilson|first2=Byron|last3=Horrocks|first3=Julia|title=Conservation of Caribbean Island Herpetofaunas Volume 2: Regional Accounts of the West Indies|date=7 April 2011|isbn=9004194088|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QNdbVSDfF6oC&amp;dq=Anguilla+antilles&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As throughout the [[Caribbean]], holidays are a cultural fixture. Anguilla's most important holidays are of historic as much as cultural importance – particularly the anniversary of the emancipation (previously August Monday in the Park), celebrated as the Summer Festival. British festivities, such as the [[Queen's Official Birthday|Queen's Birthday]], are also celebrated.

=== Cuisine ===

A significant amount of the island's produce is imported due to limited land suitable for agriculture production; much of the soil is sandy and infertile.&lt;ref name=&quot;UsaToday&quot;/&gt; Among the agriculture produced in Anguilla includes tomatoes, [[Bell pepper|peppers]], limes and other [[citrus fruit]]s, onion, garlic, squash, [[pigeon pea]]s and [[callaloo]].

Due to its internationally recognised culinary community, the island has enjoyed a reputation as &quot;the culinary capital of the Caribbean&quot;. This reputation was reinforced with the publication of the '''''(WE) Are Anguilla Cookbook''''', a guide to the cuisine of Anguilla featuring emerging and established local chefs, who share both their signature dishes and personal anecdotes regarding the island's epicurean culture. A publishing contract was secured by The Britto Agency, which had conceived the idea for the book itself.

=== Music ===
{{Main article|Music of Anguilla}}

The island's burgeoning musical community made history with the recording of ''Sounds of Anguilla (Volume 1)'', the first album ever composed solely of artists from a single Caribbean island representing multiple musical genres: pop, [[reggae]], hip-hop, [[soca music]] and R&amp;B. The album, featuring Anguillian musicians such as [[Bankie Banx]], Amalia Watty, True Intentions and Gerswin Lake and The Parables,  was released on [[iTunes]] in June 2015.

Boat racing has deep roots in Anguillian culture and is the national sport.

There are regular sailing [[regattas]] on national holidays, such as Carnival, which are contested by locally built and designed boats. These boats have names and have sponsors that print their logo on their sails.

As in many other former [[British Colony|British colonies]], cricket is also a popular sport. Anguilla is the home of [[Omari Banks]], who played for the [[West Indies Cricket Team]], while [[Cardigan Connor]] played first-class cricket for English county side [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] and was 'chef de mission' (team manager) for Anguilla's [[Commonwealth Games]] team in 2002.

The Eels were formed in 2006 by Scottish club national second row Martin Welsh, Club Sponsor and President of the AERFC Ms. Jacquie Ruan, and Canadian standout Scrumhalf Mark Harris (Toronto Scottish RFC).

Anguilla is also the birthplace of sprinter [[Zharnel Hughes]] who has represented Great Britain since 2015. He specialises in the 100m and 200m sprints. He won the 100m in the [[2013 CARIFTA Games]] with a time of 10.44 seconds, despite his time being some way below his personal best.&lt;ref&gt;[[2013 CARIFTA Games]]&lt;/ref&gt; He currently holds the ISSA/GraceKennedy Boys' and Girls' Athletics Championships record for the 100m, with a time of 10.12 seconds having taken the record from Yohan Blake.[5][6] On 13 March 2015, Hughes made his Diamond League debut where he was commended for almost beating world champion Usain Bolt.[7] On 24 July 2015, Hughes won the 200m at the London Diamond League meet to take the lead in the Diamond League standings for the season.[8] On 27 August 2015, Hughes came 5th in the 200m at the World Championships in Beijing with a time of 20.02 seconds.

[[File:Anguilla-aerial view western portion.jpg|thumb|right|An aerial view of the western portion of the island of Anguilla. The Blowing Point ferry terminal is visible in the lower right, as are (right to left) Shaddick Point, Rendezvous Bay, Cove Bay and Maundays Bay.]]

Anguilla is a flat, low-lying island of [[coral]] and [[limestone]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]], east of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Virgin Islands]]. It is directly north of [[Saint Martin]], separated from that island by the [[Anguilla Channel]]. The soil is generally thin and poor, supporting scrub, tropical and forest vegetation.

Anguilla is noted for its spectacular and ecologically important [[coral reef]]s and beaches. Apart from the main island of Anguilla itself, the territory includes a number of other smaller islands and [[cays]], mostly tiny and uninhabited. Some of these are:
* [[Anguillita]]
* [[Dog Island, Anguilla|Dog Island]]
* [[Prickly Pear Cays]]
* [[Scrub Island, Anguilla|Scrub Island]]
* [[Seal Island, Anguilla|Seal Island]]
* [[Sombrero, Anguilla|Sombrero]], also known as Hat Island
* [[Sandy Island, Anguilla|Sandy Island]]

===Geology===
Anguilla has a volcanic origin&lt;ref name=&quot;PRINCETON&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=CHRISTMAN|first1=ROBERT A|title=INVESTIGATION OF CARIBBEAN GEOLOGY NUMBER 6.|journal=The Geological Society of America, Inc|date=1953|volume=64|pages=65–96|doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1953)64[85:GOSBSM]2.0.CO;2|url=http://gsabulletin.gsapubs.org/content/64/1/65.short|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been submerged repeatedly from [[climate change]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hailey et al. 2011&quot;/&gt;

== Climate ==
{{Main article|Climate of Anguilla}}

===Temperature===
Northeastern trade winds keep this tropical island relatively cool and dry. Average annual temperature is 80&amp;nbsp;°F (27&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name=&quot;facts&quot; /&gt; July–October is its hottest period, December–February, its coolest.

===Rainfall===
Rainfall averages 35 inches (890&amp;nbsp;mm) annually,&lt;ref name=&quot;facts&quot; /&gt; although the figures vary from season to season and year to year. The island is subject to both sudden tropical storms and hurricanes, which occur in the period from July to November. The island suffered damage in 1995 from [[Hurricane Luis]] and severe flooding 5–20 feet from [[Hurricane Lenny]].

== Economy ==
{{Main article|Economy of Anguilla}}
[[File:Tree map export 2009 Anguilla.jpeg|thumb|300px|2009 export percentages]]

Anguilla's thin arid soil being largely unsuitable for agriculture, the island has few land-based [[natural resources]]. Its main industries are tourism, [[offshore companies|offshore incorporation and management]], [[offshore bank]]ing, [[captive insurance]] and fishing.

Before the 2008 worldwide crisis the economy of Anguilla was expanding rapidly, especially the tourism sector which was driving major new developments in partnerships with multi-national companies.

Anguilla's currency is the [[East Caribbean dollar]], though the US dollar is also widely accepted. The exchange rate is fixed to the US dollar at US$1 = EC$2.70.

The economy, and especially the tourism sector, suffered a setback in late 1995 due to the effects of [[Hurricane Luis]] in September but recovered in 1996. Hotels were hit particularly hard during this time. Another economic setback occurred during the aftermath of [[Hurricane Lenny]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=South America, Central America and the Caribbean 2003|publisher=Routledge|page=52|year=2002|isbn=978-1-85743-138-4|edition=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anguilla's financial system comprises 7 banks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thebanks.eu/banks-by-country/Anguilla|title=List of Banks in Anguilla|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2 money services businesses, more than 40 company managers, more than 50 insurers, 12 brokers, more than 250 captive intermediaries, more than 50 mutual funds and 8 trust companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsc.org.ai/market.shtml Market Participants]&lt;/ref&gt;

Anguilla's tourism industry received a major boost when it was selected to host the [[World Travel Awards]] in December 2014. Known as &quot;the Oscars of the travel industry&quot;, the awards ceremony was held at the [[CuisinArt Resort and Spa]] and was hosted by award-winning actress [[Vivica A. Fox]]. Anguilla was voted the World's Leading Luxury Island Destination from a short list of top-tier candidates such as St. Barts, Maldives and Mauritius.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Anguilla aims to obtain 15% of its energy from [[solar power]] so it is less reliant on expensive imported diesel. The [[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]] is helping the government gather the information it needs to change the territory's legislation, so it can integrate renewables into its grid. [[Barbados]], have also made good progress in switching to renewables, but many other SIDS are still at the early stages of planning how to integrate renewable energy into their grids. &quot;For a small island we're very far ahead,&quot; said Beth Barry, Coordinator of the Anguilla Renewable Energy Office. &quot;We've got an Energy Policy and a draft Climate Change policy and have been focussing efforts on the question of [[sustainable energy]] supply for several years now. As a result we have a lot of information we can share with other islands.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fry, Carolyn. 28 June 2012. [http://cdkn.org/2012/06/interview-with-beth-barry-on-anguilla-renewable-energy/ Anguilla moves towards cleaner energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transportation ==
{{Main article|Transport in Anguilla}}

===Air===
Anguilla is served by [[Clayton J. Lloyd International Airport]] (prior to 4 July 2010 known as Wallblake Airport). The primary runway at the airport is {{convert|5462|ft|m}} in length and can accommodate moderate-sized aircraft. Services connect to various other Caribbean islands via regional carrier [[LIAT]], local charter airlines and others. Although there are no direct scheduled flights to or from continental America or Europe, [[Tradewind Aviation]] and [[Cape Air]] provide scheduled air service to San Juan, Puerto Rico. The airport can handle large [[narrow-body]] jets such as the [[Boeing 727]], [[Boeing 737]] and [[Boeing 757]].

===Road===
Aside from taxis, there is no public transport on the island. Cars drive on the left.

===Boat===
There are regular ferries from [[Saint Martin]] to Anguilla. It is a 20-minute crossing from [[Marigot, Saint Martin|Marigot]], St. Martin to Blowing Point, Anguilla. Ferries commence service from 7:00&amp;nbsp;am. There is also a Charter Service, from [[Blowing Point]], Anguilla to [[Princess Juliana Airport]] to make travel easier. This way of travel is the most common method of transport between Anguilla and St. Martin or St. Maarten.
