&lt;!-- Definition and medical uses --&gt;
'''Aspirin''', also known as '''acetylsalicylic acid''' ('''ASA'''), is a [[medication]] used to treat [[pain]], [[fever]], or [[inflammation]].&lt;ref name=AHSF2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Aspirin|url=https://www.drugs.com/monograph/aspirin.html|website=Drugs.com|publisher=American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=30 August 2016|date=June 6, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425142242/https://www.drugs.com/monograph/aspirin.html|archivedate=25 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific inflammatory conditions in which aspirin is used include [[Kawasaki disease]], [[pericarditis]], and [[rheumatic fever]]. &lt;ref name=AHSF2016/&gt; Aspirin given shortly after a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] decreases the risk of death.&lt;ref name=AHSF2016/&gt; Aspirin is also used long-term to help prevent heart attacks, [[ischaemic stroke]]s, and [[Thrombus|blood clots]], in people at high risk.&lt;ref name=AHSF2016/&gt; Aspirin may also decrease the risk of certain types of [[cancer]], particularly [[colorectal cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patrignani|first1=P|last2=Patrono|first2=C|title=Aspirin and Cancer.|journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology|date=30 August 2016|volume=68|issue=9|pages=967–76|pmid=27561771|doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2016.05.083}}&lt;/ref&gt; For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes.&lt;ref name=AHSF2016/&gt; Aspirin is a [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID) and works similar to other NSAIDs but also suppresses the normal functioning of [[platelet]]s.&lt;ref name=AHSF2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Adverse effects --&gt;

====Headache====
Aspirin, either by itself or in a combined formulation, effectively treats certain [[Headache#Classification|types of a headache]], but its efficacy may be questionable for others. Secondary headaches, meaning those caused by another disorder or trauma, should be promptly treated by a medical provider.

Among primary headaches, the [[International Classification of Headache Disorders]] distinguishes between [[tension headache]] (the most common), migraine, and [[cluster headache]]. Aspirin or other over-the-counter analgesics are widely recognized as effective for the treatment of tension headache.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loder|first1=E|author2=Rizzoli, P|title=Tension-type headache|journal=[[The BMJ|BMJ (Clinical research ed.)]]|date=12 January 2008 | volume=336 | issue=7635 | pages=88–92 | pmid=18187725 | doi=10.1136/bmj.39412.705868.AD|pmc=2190284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspirin, especially as a component of an [[aspirin/paracetamol/caffeine]] [[combination drug|combination]], is considered a first-line therapy in the treatment of migraine, and comparable to lower doses of [[sumatriptan]]. It is most effective at stopping migraines when they are first beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilmore|first1=B|author2=Michael, M|title=Treatment of acute migraine headache|journal=American family physician|date=1 February 2011|volume=83|issue=3|pages=271–80|pmid=21302868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fever===
Like its ability to control pain, aspirin's ability to control [[fever]] is due to its action on the [[prostaglandin]] system through its irreversible inhibition of [[COX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bartfai|first1=T|author2=Conti, B|title=Fever|journal=[[The Scientific World Journal]]|date=16 March 2010|volume=10|pages=490–503|doi=10.1100/tsw.2010.50|pmid=20305990|pmc=2850202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although aspirin's use as an [[antipyretic]] in adults is well-established, many medical societies and regulatory agencies (including the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]], the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], and the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)) strongly advise against using aspirin for treatment of fever in children because of the risk of [[Reye's syndrome]], a rare but often fatal illness associated with the use of aspirin or other salicylates in children during episodes of viral or bacterial infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pugliese|first1=A|author2=Beltramo, T |author3=Torre, D|title=Reye's and Reye's-like syndromes|journal=Cell biochemistry and function|date=October 2008|volume=26|issue=7|pages=741–6|pmid=18711704|doi=10.1002/cbf.1465}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beutler|first1=AI|author2=Chesnut, GT |author3=Mattingly, JC |author4=Jamieson, B|title=FPIN's Clinical Inquiries.

===Inflammation===
Aspirin is used as an [[anti-inflammatory agent]] for both acute and long-term [[inflammation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Thea Morris, Melanie Stables, Adrian Hobbs, Patricia de Souza, Paul Colville-Nash, Tim Warner, Justine Newson, Geoffrey Bellingan, and Derek W.

===Heart attacks and strokes===
Aspirin is an important part of the treatment of those who have had a [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation: the acute management of myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation [Internet] |journal=NICE Clinical Guidelines |issue=167 |date=July 2013 |at=17.2 Asprin |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0071000/# |pmid=25340241 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231192814/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0071000/ |archivedate=31 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One trial found that among those likely having an [[ST-segment elevation MI]], aspirin saves the life of 1 in 42 by reducing the 30-day death rate from 11.8% to 9.4%.&lt;ref name=Qu2009/&gt; There was no difference in major bleeding, but there was a small increase in minor bleeding amounting to roughly 1 in every 167 people given aspirin.&lt;ref name=Qu2009&gt;{{cite web |last1=Quaas |first1=Joshua |title=Aspirin given immediately for a major heart attack (STEMI) |publisher=The NNT |url=http://www.thennt.com/nnt/aspirin-for-major-heart-attack/ |accessdate=10 August 2016 |date=November 28, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809181554/http://www.thennt.com/nnt/aspirin-for-major-heart-attack/ |archivedate=9 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====High risk====
For people who have already had a heart attack or stroke, taking aspirin daily for two years prevented 1 in 50 from having a cardiovascular problem (heart attack, stroke, or death), but also caused non-fatal bleeding problems to occur in 1 of 400 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Newman |first1=David |title=Aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease in people with known heart disease or strokes |url=http://www.thennt.com/nnt/aspirin-for-cardiovascular-prevention-after-prior-heart-attack-or-stroke/#%22 |website=The NNT |accessdate=30 November 2015 |date=July 10, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208160242/http://www.thennt.com/nnt/aspirin-for-cardiovascular-prevention-after-prior-heart-attack-or-stroke/#%22 |archivedate=8 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid20112887&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=SL|author2=Lorenc, T|title=Secondary prevention of coronary artery disease|journal=American family physician|date=1 February 2010|volume=81|issue=3|pages=289–96|pmid=20112887}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19482214&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baigent |first1=C |last2=Blackwell |first2=L |last3=Collins |first3=R |last4=Emberson |first4=J |last5=Godwin |first5=J |last6=Peto |first6=R |last7=Buring |first7=J |last8=Hennekens |first8=C |last9=Kearney |first9=P |last10=Meade |first10=T |last11=Patrono |first11=C |last12=Roncaglioni |first12=MC |last13=Zanchetti |first13=A |title=Aspirin in the primary and secondary prevention of vascular disease: collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomised trials |journal=[[The Lancet]] |volume=373 |issue=9678 |pages=1849–60 |year=2009 |pmid=19482214 |pmc=2715005 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60503-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lower risk====
Studies have not found an overall benefit in the general population of healthy people, although it is possible that there are small benefits for those at especially high risk, despite never having had a heart attack or stroke in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration (ATT)|last2=Baigent|first2=C|last3=Blackwell|first3=L|last4=Collins|first4=R|last5=Emberson|first5=J|last6=Godwin|first6=J|last7=Peto|first7=R|last8=Buring|first8=J|last9=Hennekens|first9=C|last10=Kearney|first10=P|last11=Meade|first11=T|last12=Patrono|first12=C|last13=Roncaglioni|first13=MC|last14=Zanchetti|first14=A|title=Aspirin in the primary and secondary prevention of vascular disease: collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomised trials |journal=[[The Lancet]] |date=30 May 2009|volume=373|issue=9678|pages=1849–60|pmid=19482214|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(09)60503-1|pmc=2715005}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that among those who have never had a heart attack or stroke, taking aspirin daily for 1 year prevents 1 in 1,667 from having a non-fatal heart attack or stroke, but caused 1 in 3,333 to have a non-fatal bleeding event. However, the study population were at relatively higher risk than those who had never had a heart attack or stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Newman |first1=David |title=Aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke |url=http://www.thennt.com/nnt/aspirin-to-prevent-a-first-heart-attack-or-stroke/ |website=theNNT |accessdate=30 November 2015 |date=January 8, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151209010137/http://www.thennt.com/nnt/aspirin-to-prevent-a-first-heart-attack-or-stroke/ |archivedate=9 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspirin appears to offer little benefit to those at lower risk of heart attack or stroke—for instance, those without a history of these events or with pre-existing disease. Some studies recommend aspirin on a case-by-case basis,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19293073&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolff|first1=T|author2=Miller, T |author3=Ko, S|title=Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events: an update of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=17 March 2009|volume=150|issue=6|pages=405–10|pmid=19293073|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-150-6-200903170-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USPSTF aspirin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=U.S. Preventive Services Task Force|title=Aspirin for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease: recommendation statement|url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsasmi.htm|accessdate=15 August 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911035755/http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsasmi.htm|archivedate=11 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others have suggested the risks of other events, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, were enough to outweigh any potential benefit, and recommended against using aspirin for primary prevention entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berger|first1=JS |author2=Lala, A |author3=Krantz, MJ |author4=Baker, GS |author5=Hiatt, WR |title=Aspirin for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients without clinical cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis of randomized trials|journal=American Heart Journal|date=July 2011|volume=162|issue=1|pages=115–24.e2|pmid=21742097|doi=10.1016/j.ahj.2011.04.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspirin has also been suggested as a component of a [[polypill]] for prevention of cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref name=pmid16100022&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norris|first=JW |title=Antiplatelet agents in secondary prevention of stroke: a perspective |journal=Stroke: a journal of cerebral circulation |date=September 2005|volume=36|issue=9|pages=2034–6|pmid=16100022|doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000177887.14339.46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid16603580&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sleight|first1=P|author2=Pouleur, H |author3=Zannad, F|title=Benefits, challenges, and registerability of the polypill |journal=European Heart Journal|date=July 2006|volume=27|issue=14|pages=1651–6|pmid=16603580|doi=10.1093/eurheartj/ehi841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====After surgery====
After [[percutaneous coronary intervention]]s (PCIs), such as the placement of a [[coronary artery]] [[stent]], a U.S. [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] guideline recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)|title=2011 ACCF/AHA/SCAI guideline for percutaneous coronary artery intervention.

This is called dual [[antiplatelet drug|antiplatelet therapy]] (DAPT). United States and European Union guidelines disagree somewhat about how long, and for what indications this combined therapy should be continued after surgery. U.S. guidelines recommend DAPT for at least 12 months, while EU guidelines recommend DAPT for 6–12 months after a drug-eluting stent placement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Musumeci|first1=G|author2=Di Lorenzo, E |author3=Valgimigli, M|title=Dual antiplatelet therapy duration: what are the drivers?|journal=[[Current Opinion in Cardiology]]|date=December 2011|volume=26 Suppl 1|pages=S4–14|pmid=22129582|doi=10.1097/01.hco.0000409959.11246.ba}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they agree that aspirin be continued indefinitely after DAPT is complete.

Aspirin is a first-line treatment for the fever and joint-pain symptoms of [[rheumatic fever|acute rheumatic fever]]. The therapy often lasts for one to two weeks, and is rarely indicated for longer periods.

===Resistance===
For some people, aspirin does not have as strong an effect on platelets as for others, an effect known as aspirin-resistance or insensitivity.

&lt;!--Please note that I do not have access to the full text of this source. The abstract and lay summary state that pseudoresistance occurs with enteric-coated aspirin only.

===Dosage===
[[File:Regular strength enteric coated aspirin tablets.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Coated 325&amp;nbsp;mg (5-grain) aspirin tablets]]
[[File:5 grain aspirin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The 5-grain aspirin. The usage guidance label on a bottle of aspirin indicates that the dosage is &quot;325&amp;nbsp;mg (5&amp;nbsp;gr)&quot;.]]
Adult aspirin tablets are produced in standardised sizes, which vary slightly from country to country, for example 300&amp;nbsp;mg in Britain and 325&amp;nbsp;mg (or 5 [[Grain (unit)|grains]]) in the United States. Smaller doses are based on these standards, ''e.g.'', 75&amp;nbsp;mg and 81&amp;nbsp;mg tablets. The 81&amp;nbsp;mg (1{{frac|4}}-grain) tablets are commonly called &quot;baby aspirin&quot; or &quot;baby-strength&quot;, because they were originally—but no longer—intended to be administered to infants and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Invention of the safety cap |url = http://digitaldukemed.mc.duke.edu/pcc/safety_cap.html |website = digitaldukemed.mc.duke.edu |accessdate = 2015-09-04 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071131/http://digitaldukemed.mc.duke.edu/pcc/safety_cap.html |archivedate = 4 March 2016 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; No medical significance occurs due to the slight difference in dosage between the 75&amp;nbsp;mg and the 81&amp;nbsp;mg tablets.

In general, for adults, doses are taken four times a day for fever or arthritis,&lt;ref name=BNF&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[British National Formulary]]|edition=45|year=2003|publisher= [[British Medical Journal]] and [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with doses near the maximal daily dose used historically for the treatment of [[rheumatic fever]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/druginfo/monograph?cid=med&amp;drugid=3881&amp;drugname=Aspirin+EC+Oral&amp;monotype=monograph |title=Aspirin monograph: dosages, etc |publisher=Medscape.com |accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the prevention of [[myocardial infarction]] (MI) in someone with documented or suspected [[coronary artery disease]], much lower doses are taken once daily.&lt;ref name=BNF /&gt;

March 2009 recommendations from the USPSTF on the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease encourage men aged 45–79 and women aged 55–79 to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in MI for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in [[Gastrointestinal bleeding|gastrointestinal hemorrhage]].&lt;ref name=medscape&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cme.medscape.com/viewarticle/589895?src=cmemp |title=Aspirin: more evidence that low dose is all that is needed |publisher=Medscape CME |accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHI study said regular low dose (75 or 81&amp;nbsp;mg) aspirin female users had a 25% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 14% lower risk of death from any cause.&lt;ref name=medscape /&gt; Low-dose aspirin use was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of cardiovascular events, and lower aspirin doses (75 or 81&amp;nbsp;mg/day) may optimize efficacy and safety for people requiring aspirin for long-term prevention.&lt;ref name=medscape /&gt;

In children with Kawasaki disease, aspirin is taken at dosages based on body weight, initially four times a day for up to two weeks and then at a lower dose once daily for a further six to eight weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[British National Formulary for Children]]|year=2006|publisher= [[British Medical Journal]] and [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to enteric coating, &quot;buffering&quot; is the other main method companies have used to try to mitigate the problem of gastrointestinal bleeding. Buffering agents are intended to work by preventing the aspirin from concentrating in the walls of the stomach, although the benefits of buffered aspirin are disputed. Almost any buffering agent used in antacids can be used; Bufferin, for example, uses [[magnesium oxide]]. Other preparations use [[calcium carbonate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/acidbase/faq/buffered-aspirin.shtml |title=General chemistry online: FAQ: Acids and bases: What is the buffer system in buffered aspirin? |publisher=Antoine.frostburg.edu |accessdate=11 May 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414145143/http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/acidbase/faq/buffered-aspirin.shtml |archivedate=14 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reye's syndrome===
{{Main article|Reye's syndrome}}
Reye's syndrome, a rare but severe illness characterized by acute [[encephalopathy]] and [[fatty liver]], can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illness or infection. From 1981 through 1997, 1207 cases of Reye's syndrome in people younger than 18 were reported to the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]. Of these, 93% reported being ill in the three weeks preceding the onset of Reye's syndrome, most commonly with a [[Respiratory tract infection|respiratory infection]], [[chickenpox]], or [[diarrhea]].

===Skin===
For a small number of people, taking aspirin can result in symptoms resembling an allergic reaction, including [[hives]], swelling, and headache. The reaction is caused by [[salicylate intolerance]] and is not a true [[allergy]], but rather an inability to metabolize even small amounts of aspirin, resulting in an [[#Overdose|overdose]].

Aspirin and other NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, may delay the healing of skin wounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stadelmann|first1=WK|last2=Digenis|first2=AG|last3=Tobin|first3=GR|title=Impediments to wound healing.|journal=American journal of surgery|date=August 1998|volume=176|issue=2A Suppl|pages=39S-47S|pmid=9777971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspirin may however help heal venous leg ulcers that have not healed following usual treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maessen-Visch|first1=MB|last2=de Roos|first2=KP|title=Dutch venous ulcer guideline update|journal=[[Phlebology (journal)|Phlebology / Venous Forum of the Royal Society of Medicine]] |date=19 May 2014|volume=29|issue=1 suppl|pages=153–156|pmid=24843102|doi=10.1177/0268355514529693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other adverse effects===
Aspirin can induce [[angioedema|swelling of skin tissues]] in some people. In one study, [[angioedema]] appeared one to six hours after ingesting aspirin in some of the people. However, when the aspirin was taken alone, it did not cause angioedema in these people; the aspirin had been taken in combination with another NSAID-induced drug when angioedema appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Berges-Gimeno MP, Stevenson DD |year=2004 |title=Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced reactions and desensitization |journal=[[Journal of Asthma]] |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=375–84 |pmid=15281324 |doi=10.1081/JAS-120037650}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspirin and other NSAIDs can cause [[hyperkalemia|abnormally high blood levels of potassium]] by inducing a [[hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism|hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronic state]] via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis; however, these agents do not typically cause hyperkalemia by themselves in the setting of normal renal function and euvolemic state.&lt;ref&gt;Medical knowledge self-assessment program for students 4, By American College of Physicians, Clerkship Directors in Internal Medicine, Nephrology 227, Item 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspirin can cause prolonged bleeding after operations for up to 10 days. In one study, 30 of 6499 people having elective surgery required reoperations to control bleeding. Twenty had diffuse bleeding and 10 had bleeding from a site. Diffuse, but not discrete, bleeding was associated with the preoperative use of aspirin alone or in combination with other NSAIDS in 19 of the 20 diffuse bleeding people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Scher, KS |year=1996 |title=Unplanned reoperation for bleeding |journal=[[American Surgeon]] |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=52–55 |pmid=8540646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 July 2015, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] toughened warnings of increased [[heart attack]] and [[stroke]] risk associated with [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAID).

===Overdose===
{{Main article|Aspirin poisoning}}
Aspirin overdose can be acute or chronic. In acute poisoning, a single large dose is taken; in chronic poisoning, higher than normal doses are taken over a period of time. Acute overdose has a [[mortality rate]] of 2%. Chronic overdose is more commonly lethal, with a mortality rate of 25%;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kreplick, LW |year=2001 |title=Salicylate toxicity in emergency medicine |publisher=[[Medscape]] |url=http://misc.medscape.com/pi/android/medscapeapp/html/A818242-business.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831184805/http://misc.medscape.com/pi/android/medscapeapp/html/A818242-business.html |archivedate=31 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; chronic overdose may be especially severe in children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pediatrics1982-gaudreault&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Gaudreault P, Temple AR, Lovejoy FH |title=The relative severity of acute versus chronic salicylate poisoning in children: a clinical comparison |journal=Pediatrics |year=1982 |pages=566–9 |volume=70 |issue=4 |pmid= 7122154}} (primary source)&lt;/ref&gt; Toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments, including [[activated charcoal]], intravenous dextrose and normal saline, [[sodium bicarbonate]], and [[dialysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice |last=Marx |first=John |year=2006 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier |isbn=978-0-323-02845-5 |page=2242}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate, the active metabolite of aspirin, by automated spectrophotometric methods.

===Interactions===
Aspirin is known to [[Drug interaction|interact]] with other drugs.

==Chemical properties==
Aspirin decomposes rapidly in solutions of [[ammonium acetate]] or the [[acetate]]s, [[carbonate]]s, [[citrate]]s, or [[hydroxide]]s of the [[alkali metals]]. It is stable in dry air, but gradually [[hydrolyses]] in contact with moisture to [[acetic acid|acetic]] and [[salicylic acid]]s. In solution with alkalis, the hydrolysis proceeds rapidly and the clear solutions formed may consist entirely of acetate and salicylate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Reynolds, E.F. |encyclopedia=Martindale: the extra pharmacopoeia |edition=28th|year=1982|pages=234–82|title=Aspirin and similar analgesic and anti-inflammatory agents|publisher=Rittenhouse Book Distributors|isbn=0853691606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[flour mill]]s, factories that make aspirin tablets must pay attention to how much of the powder gets into the air inside the building, because [[dust explosion|the powder-air mixture can be explosive]].

===Synthesis===
The synthesis of aspirin is classified as an [[ester]]ification reaction. [[Salicylic acid]] is treated with [[acetic anhydride]], an acid derivative, causing a chemical reaction that turns salicylic acid's [[hydroxyl]] group into an [[ester]] group (R-OH → R-OCOCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). This process yields aspirin and [[acetic acid]], which is considered a [[byproduct]] of this reaction. Small amounts of [[sulfuric acid]] (and occasionally [[phosphoric acid]]) are almost always used as a [[catalyst]]. This method is commonly employed in undergraduate teaching labs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Experimental organic chemistry |last=Palleros |first=Daniel R |year=2000 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=New York | isbn=0-471-28250-2 |page=494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polymorphism===
[[Polymorphism (materials science)|Polymorphism]], or the ability of a substance to form more than one [[crystal structure]], is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients. Many drugs are receiving regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph. For a long time, only one crystal structure for aspirin was known. That aspirin might have a second crystalline form was suspected since the 1960s. The elusive second polymorph was first discovered by Vishweshwar and coworkers in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vishweshwar | first1 = P | last2 = McMahon | first2 = JA | last3 = Oliveira | first3 = M | last4 = Peterson | first4 = ML | last5 = Zaworotko | first5 = MJ | title = The predictably elusive form II of aspirin | journal = [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]] | volume = 127 | issue = 48 | pages = 16802–16803 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16316223 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1021/ja056455b }}&lt;/ref&gt; and fine structural details were given by Bond ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Bond, Andrew D |author2=Boese, Roland |author3=Desiraju, Gautam R |title = On the polymorphism of aspirin: crystalline aspirin as intergrowths of two &quot;polymorphic&quot; domains |journal = [[Angewandte Chemie International Edition]] |year = 2007|volume = 46|issue = 4|pages = 618–622|doi = 10.1002/anie.200603373 |pmid= 17139692}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new crystal type was found after attempted cocrystallization of aspirin and [[levetiracetam]] from hot [[acetonitrile]].

In the (unambiguous) form I, two salicylic molecules form centrosymmetric [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimers]] through the acetyl groups with the (acidic) [[methyl]] proton to [[carbonyl]] [[hydrogen bond]]s, and in the newly claimed form II, each salicylic molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one. With respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the [[carboxylic acid]] groups, both polymorphs form identical dimer structures.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Discovery of the mechanism===

===Prostaglandins and thromboxanes===
Aspirin's ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible inactivation of the [[cyclooxygenase]] (COX; officially known as prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase, PTGS) enzyme required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis. Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a [[serine]] residue in the active site of the PTGS enzyme. This makes aspirin different from other NSAIDs (such as [[diclofenac]] and [[ibuprofen]]), which are reversible inhibitors ([[Suicide inhibition]]).

Low-dose aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of [[thromboxane A2|thromboxane A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet (8–9 days). This antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in people who have had a heart attack, unstable angina, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4456 |title=Aspirin in heart attack and stroke prevention |accessdate=8 May 2008 |publisher=American Heart Association |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331031146/http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4456 |archivedate=31 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 40&amp;nbsp;mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Tohgi |first1=H |author2=S Konno |author3=K Tamura |author4=B Kimura |author5=K Kawano|year = 1992|title = Effects of low-to-high doses of aspirin on platelet aggregability and metabolites of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin|journal = [[Stroke (journal)|Stroke]] | volume = 23|pages = 1400–1403 |pmid=1412574|issue = 10| doi=10.1161/01.STR.23.10.1400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostaglandins, local [[hormone]]s produced in the body, have diverse effects, including the transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of the [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic]] thermostat, and inflammation. Thromboxanes are responsible for the aggregation of platelets that form [[clot|blood clots]]. Heart attacks are caused primarily by blood clots, and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention for acute myocardial infarction.

===COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition===
At least two different types of cyclooxygenases, COX-1 and COX-2, are acted on by aspirin. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of COX-2. COX-2 normally produces prostanoids, most of which are proinflammatory. Aspirin-modified PTGS2 produces lipoxins, most of which are anti-inflammatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|

Thus, the protective anticoagulative effect of [[PGI2]] is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new PTGS once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference with reversible inhibitors.

Furthermore, aspirin, while inhibiting the ability of COX-2 to form pro-inflammatory products such as the [[prostaglandins]], converts this enzyme's activity from a prostaglandin-forming cyclooxygenase to a [[lipoxygenase]]-like enzyme: aspirin-treated COX-2 metabolizes a variety of [[polyunsaturated fatty acids]] to hydroperoxy products which are then further metabolized to [[specialized proresolving mediators]] such as the aspirin-triggered [[lipoxin]]s, aspirin-triggered [[resolvins]], and aspirin-triggered [[maresin]]s.  These mediators possess potent anti-inflammatory activity. It is proposed that this aspirin-triggered transition of COX-2 from cyclooxygenase to lipoxygenase activity and the consequential formation of specialized proresolving mediators contributes to the anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid25895638&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Romano M, Cianci E, Simiele F, Recchiuti A | title = Lipoxins and aspirin-triggered lipoxins in resolution of inflammation | journal = [[European Journal of Pharmacology]] | volume = 760 | issue = | pages = 49–63 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25895638 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2015.03.083 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid23747022&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Serhan CN, Chiang N | title = Resolution phase lipid mediators of inflammation: agonists of resolution | journal = [[Current Opinion in Pharmacology]] | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 632–40 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23747022 | pmc = 3732499 | doi = 10.1016/j.coph.2013.05.012 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid26546723&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weylandt KH | title = Docosapentaenoic acid derived metabolites and mediators - The new world of lipid mediator medicine in a nutshell | journal = [[European Journal of Pharmacology]]  | volume = 785| issue = | pages = 108–115| year = 2015 | pmid = 26546723 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2015.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional mechanisms===
Aspirin has been shown to have at least three additional modes of action. It uncouples [[oxidative phosphorylation]] in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons.&lt;ref name=&quot;SomasundaramS&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Somasundaram|first2=G|first3=RJ|first4=J|first5=M|first6=IA|first7=S|first8=A|first9=R|issue=5|last2=Sigthorsson|last3=Simpson|last4=Watts|last5=Jacob|last6=Tavares|last7=Rafi|last8=Roseth|last9=Foster |year=2000|title=Uncoupling of intestinal mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and inhibition of cyclooxygenase are required for the development of NSAID-enteropathy in the rat|journal=[[Alimentary Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics]] |volume=14 |pages=639–650 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2036.2000.00723.x |pmid=10792129|last10=Price|last11=Wrigglesworth|last12=Bjarnason|first10=AB|first12=I| displayauthors=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspirin buffers and transports the protons. When high doses are given, it may actually cause fever, owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain, as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses. In addition, aspirin induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation. This reduced leukocyte adhesion is an important step in the immune response to infection; however, evidence is insufficient to show aspirin helps to fight infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Mark J |last=Paul-Clark |first2=Thong van |last2=Cao |first3=Niloufar |last3=Moradi-Bidhendi |first4=Dianne |last4=Cooper |first5=Derek W |last5=Gilroy |lastauthoramp=yes |title=15-epi-lipoxin A4–mediated induction of nitric oxide explains how aspirin inhibits acute inflammation |journal=[[The Journal of Experimental Medicine]] |year=2004 |volume=200 |issue=1 |pages=69–78 |doi=10.1084/jem.20040566 |pmid=15238606 |pmc=2213311}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent data also suggest salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signaling through [[NF-κB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McCarty |first=M.

Aspirin is readily broken down in the body to salicylic acid, which itself has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects. In 2012, salicylic acid was found to activate [[AMP-activated protein kinase]], which has been suggested as a possible explanation for some of the effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawley | first1 = SA | last2 = Fullerton | first2 = MD | last3 = Ross | first3 = FA | last4 = Schertzer | first4 = JD | last5 = Chevtzoff | first5 = C | last6 = Walker | first6 = KJ | last7 = Peggie | first7 = MW | last8 = Zibrova | first8 = D | last9 = Green | first9 = KA | last10 = Mustard | first10 = KJ | last11 = Kemp | first11 = BE | last12 = Sakamoto | first12 = K | last13 = Steinberg | first13 = GR | last14 = Hardie | first14 = DG | title = The ancient drug salicylate directly activates AMP-activated protein kinase | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]]| volume = 336 | issue = 6083 | pages = 918–922 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22517326 | pmc = 3399766| bibcode = 2012Sci...336..918H | doi = 10.1126/science.1215327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Raffensperger, Lisa|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21718-clues-to-aspirins-anticancer-effects-revealed.html|title=Clues to aspirin's anti-cancer effects revealed|journal=[[New Scientist]]|date=19 April 2012|doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(12)61073-2|volume=214|issue=2862|page=16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530020136/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21718-clues-to-aspirins-anticancer-effects-revealed.html|archivedate=30 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Acetylsalicylic acid is a [[weak acid]], and very little of it is [[Acid dissociation constant|ionized]] in the [[stomach]] after oral administration. Acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through the cell membrane in the [[acidic]] conditions of the stomach. The increased [[pH]] and larger surface area of the [[small intestine]] causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there, as more of it is ionised. Owing to the formation of concretions, aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, and [[blood plasma|plasma]] concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.&lt;ref name=&quot;RK Ferguson&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Death following self-poisoning with aspirin |journal=[[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]]|date=17 August 1970|first1=RK|last1=Ferguson|author2=Boutros, AR|volume=213|issue=7|pages=1186–8|pmid=5468267|doi=10.1001/jama.213.7.1186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FL Kaufman&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Darvon poisoning with delayed salicylism: a case report|journal=Pediatrics|date=April 1970|first1=FL|last1=Kaufman|author2=Dubansky, AS|volume=49|issue=4|pages=610–1 |pmid=5013423}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;G Levy&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM197208312870903 |title=Salicylate accumulation kinetics in man |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |date=31 August 1972 |first1=G |last1=Levy |author2=Tsuchiya, T |volume=287 |issue=9 |pages=430–2 |pmid=5044917 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 50–80% of salicylate in the blood is bound to [[albumin|albumin protein]], while the rest remains in the active, ionized state; protein binding is concentration-dependent. Saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity. The volume of distribution is 0.1–0.2 L/kg. Acidosis increases the volume of distribution because of enhancement of tissue penetration of salicylates.&lt;ref name=&quot;G Levy&quot;/&gt;

As much as 80% of therapeutic doses of salicylic acid is [[metabolism|metabolized]] in the [[liver]]. [[Conjugated system|Conjugation]] with [[glycine]] forms [[salicyluric acid]], and with [[glucuronic acid]] to form two different glucuronide esters. The conjugate with the acetyl group intact is referred to as the ''acyl glucuronide''; the deacetylated conjugate is the ''phenolic glucuronide''. These metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity. Small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated to [[gentisic acid]]. With large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first-order to zero-order, as [[metabolic pathway]]s become saturated and [[kidney|renal]] excretion becomes increasingly important.&lt;ref name=&quot;G Levy&quot;/&gt;

Salicylates are excreted mainly by the kidneys as salicyluric acid (75%), free salicylic acid (10%), salicylic phenol (10%), and acyl glucuronides (5%), [[gentisic acid]] (&lt; 1%), and [[2,3-Dihydroxybenzoic acid|2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid is a product of human aspirin metabolism |authors=Martin Grootveld, Barry Halliwell |journal=[[Biochemical Pharmacology (journal)|Biochemical Pharmacology]] |volume =37 |issue =2 |date=15 January 1988 |pages=271–280 |pmid=3342084 |doi=10.1016/0006-2952(88)90729-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When small doses (less than 250&amp;nbsp;mg in an adult) are ingested, all pathways proceed by first-order kinetics, with an elimination half-life of about 2.0 h to 4.5 h.&lt;ref name=&quot;O Hartwig&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Pharmacokinetic considerations of common analgesics and antipyretics |journal=[[American Journal of Medicine]] |date=14 November 1983|first=Otto H|last=Hartwig|volume=75|issue=5A|pages=30–7 |pmid=6606362 |doi=10.1016/0002-9343(83)90230-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AK Done&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Salicylate intoxication.

===Trademark===
Due to allowing the use of &quot;Aspirin&quot; for years by other manufacturing chemists, despite the trademark-infringing nature of the use, and its own failure to use the name for its own product when it began selling direct, Bayer lost its trademark in the United States in 1918, affirmed by court appeal in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Bayer Co. v.

[...] Yet, had it not been indifferent to the results of selling to the consumer, it could have protected itself just as well at the time when consumers began to buy directly as in 1915. Nothing would have been easier than to insist that the tablet makers should market the drug in small tin boxes bearing the plaintiff's name, or to take over the sale just as it did later. Instead of this, they allowed the manufacturing chemists to build up this part of the demand without regard to the trademark. Having made that bed, they must be content to lie in it.

== Veterinary medicine ==
Aspirin is sometimes used for pain relief or as an anticoagulant in veterinary medicine, primarily in dogs and sometimes horses, although newer medications with fewer side effects are generally used instead.

Both dogs and horses are susceptible to the gastrointestinal side effects associated with salicylates, but it is a convenient treatment for arthritis in older dogs, and has shown some promise in cases of [[laminitis]] in horses.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;ref name=&quot;CambridgeH&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors = Cambridge H, Lees P, Hooke RE, Russell CS |title=Antithrombotic actions of aspirin in the horse |journal=[[Equine Veterinary Journal]] |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=123–7 |year=1991 |pmid=1904347|doi=10.1111/j.2042-3306.1991.tb02736.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is no longer commonly used for cases of laminitis, as it could be counterproductive for treatment. Aspirin should be used in animals only under the direct supervision of a [[veterinarian]]; in particular, cats lack the [[glucuronide]] conjugates that aid in the excretion of aspirin, making it potentially toxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Lappin, Michael R |title=Feline internal medicine secrets |year=2001 |publisher=Hanley &amp; Belfus |location=Philadelphia |isbn=1-56053-461-3 |page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; No clinical signs of toxicosis occurred when cats were given 25&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of aspirin every 48 hours for 4 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/toxicology/toxicities_from_human_drugs/analgesics_toxicity.html |title=Analgesics (toxicity) |publisher=Merck |accessdate=3 March 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411095033/http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/toxicology/toxicities_from_human_drugs/analgesics_toxicity.html |archivedate=11 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
