'''Alexander III''' ({{lang-rus|Алекса́ндр III Алекса́ндрович|r=Aleksandr III Aleksandrovich}}; {{OldStyleDateNY|10 March|26 February}} 1845{{snd}}{{OldStyleDateNY|1 November|20 October}} 1894) was the [[Emperor of Russia#Emperors of Russia|Emperor]] of [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[King of Poland]], and [[Grand Duke of Finland]] from {{OldStyleDate|13 March |1881|1 March}} until his death on {{OldStyleDate|1 November|1894|20 October}}. He was highly [[conservative]] and reversed some of the liberal reforms of his father, [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]. During Alexander's reign Russia fought no major wars, for which he was styled &quot;'''The Peacemaker'''&quot; ({{lang-rus|Миротво́рец, ''Mirotvórets''|p=mʲɪrɐˈtvorʲɪt͡s}}).

==Early life==

===Disposition===
[[File:Tsarevitch Alexander later Alexander III 1865 by Sergei Levitsky.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Alexander III as [[Tsesarevich]], by [[Sergei Lvovich Levitsky]], 1865]]

Grand Duke Alexander Alexandrovich was born on 10 March 1845 at the [[Winter Palace]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russian Empire]], the second son and third child of [[Emperor of Russia#Emperors of Russia|Emperor]] [[Alexander II of Russia]] and his first wife [[Marie of Hesse]].

In disposition Alexander bore little resemblance to his soft-hearted, liberal father, and still less to his refined, philosophic, sentimental, chivalrous, yet cunning great-uncle, Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]], who could have been given the title of &quot;the first gentleman of [[Europe]]&quot;. Although an enthusiastic amateur musician and patron of the [[ballet]], Alexander was seen as lacking refinement and elegance. Indeed, he rather relished the idea of being of the same rough texture as some of his subjects. His straightforward, abrupt manner savoured sometimes of gruffness, while his direct, unadorned method of expressing himself harmonized well with his rough-hewn, immobile features and somewhat sluggish movements. His education was not such as to soften these peculiarities.{{sfn|Wallace|1911|pp=561-562}} More than six feet tall (about 1.9&amp;nbsp;m), he was also noted for his immense physical strength. A [[sebaceous cyst]] on the left side of his nose caused him to be mocked by some of his contemporaries, and he sat for photographs and portraits with the right side of his face most prominent.

An account from the memoirs of the artist [[Alexander Benois]] gives one impression of Alexander III:

&lt;blockquote&gt;After a performance of the ballet ''[[Tsar Kandavl or Le Roi Candaule|Tsar Kandavl]]'' at the [[Mariinsky Theatre]], I first caught sight of the Emperor. I was struck by the size of the man, and although cumbersome and heavy, he was still a mighty figure. There was indeed something of the [[muzhik]] ''[Russian peasant]'' about him. The look of his bright eyes made quite an impression on me. As he passed where I was standing, he raised his head for a second, and to this day I can remember what I felt as our eyes met. It was a look as cold as steel, in which there was something threatening, even frightening, and it struck me like a blow. The Tsar's gaze! The look of a man who stood above all others, but who carried a monstrous burden and who every minute had to fear for his life and the lives of those closest to him. In later years I came into contact with the Emperor on several occasions, and I felt not the slightest bit timid. In more ordinary cases Tsar Alexander III could be at once kind, simple, and even almost homely.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Education===
Though he was destined to be a strongly counter-reforming emperor, Alexander had little prospect of succeeding to the throne during the first two decades of his life, as he had an elder brother, [[Grand Duke Nicholas Alexandrovich of Russia|Nicholas]], who seemed of robust constitution. Even when Nicholas first displayed symptoms of delicate health, the notion that he might die young was never taken seriously, and he was betrothed to [[Dagmar of Denmark (Maria Feodorovna)|Princess Dagmar of Denmark]], daughter of [[King Christian IX of Denmark]] and [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen Louise of Denmark]], and whose siblings included [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|King Frederick VIII of Denmark]], [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra, Queen of the United Kingdom]] and [[King George I of Greece]]. Great solicitude was devoted to the education of Nicholas as [[tsesarevich]], whereas Alexander received only the training of an ordinary Grand Duke of that period. This included acquaintance with [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]], and [[military drill]].{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=562}}

===As Tsesarevich===
[[File:Alexander III and Maria Fedorovna's coronation by G.Becker (1888, Hermitage).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Grand painting by the artist [[Georges Becker]] of the coronation of Tsar Alexander III and [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Empress Maria Fyodorovna]], which took place on {{OldStyleDate|27 May|1883|15 May}} at the [[Cathedral of the Dormition|Uspensky Sobor]] of the [[Moscow Kremlin]]. On the left of the [[dais]] can be seen his young son and heir, [[Nicholas II of Russia|the Tsesarevich Nicholas]], and behind Nicholas can be seen a young [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke George]].]]
Alexander became [[Tsesarevich]] upon Nicholas's sudden death in 1865; it was then that he began to study the principles of law and administration under [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]], then a professor of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] at [[Moscow State University]] and later (from 1880) [[chief procurator]] of the [[Holy Synod]] of the Orthodox Church in Russia. Pobedonostsev instilled into the young man's mind the belief that zeal for [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] thought was an essential factor of Russian [[patriotism]] to be cultivated by every right-minded emperor. While he was [[heir apparent]] from 1865 to 1881 Alexander did not play a prominent part in public affairs, but allowed it to become known that he had ideas which did not coincide with the principles of the existing government.{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=562}}

On his deathbed the previous tsesarevich was said to have expressed the wish that his fiancée, Princess Dagmar of Denmark, should marry his successor.{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=562}} This wish was swiftly realized when on {{OldStyleDate|9 November|1866|28 October}} in the [[Grand Church of the Winter Palace]] in [[St. Petersburg]], Alexander wed Dagmar, who converted to Orthodox Christianity and took the name [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Maria Feodorovna]]. The union proved a happy one to the end; unlike his father's, there was no adultery in his marriage. The couple spent their wedding night at the Tsesarevich's private dacha known as &quot;My Property&quot;.

Later on the Tsesarevich became estranged from his father; this was due to their vastly differing political views, as well was his resentment towards Alexander II's long-standing relationship with [[Catherine Dolgorukov]] (with whom he had several illegitimate children) while his mother, the [[Marie Alexandrovna, Tsarina of Russia|Empress]], was suffering from chronic ill-health.&lt;ref&gt;Van Der Kiste, John ''The Romanovs: 1818–1959 ''(Sutton Publishing, 2003) p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; To the scandal of many at court, including the Tsesarevich himself, Alexander II married Catherine a mere month after Marie Alexandrovna's death in 1880.

==Reign==
On 1 March 1881 (O.S.) Alexander's father, [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], was assassinated by members of the [[terrorism|terrorist]] organization [[Narodnaya Volya]]. As a result, he ascended to the Russian imperial throne in [[Ninasi|Nennal]] on 13 March 1881. He and Maria Feodorovna were officially crowned and anointed at the [[Assumption Cathedral in Moscow]] on 27 May 1883.

===Domestic policies===
On the day of his assassination Alexander II had signed an [[ukaz]] setting up consultative commissions to advise the monarch. On ascending to the throne, however, Alexander III took [[Pobedonostsev]]'s advice and canceled the policy before its publication. He made it clear that his [[autocracy]] would not be limited.

[[File:Alexander-Maria.jpg|thumb|200px|Alexander and his wife [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Empress Maria Fyodorovna]] on holiday in [[Copenhagen]] in 1893.]]
[[File:Alexander III reception by Repin.jpg|thumb|300px|Alexander receiving rural district elders in the yard of [[Petrovsky Palace]] in Moscow, by [[Ilya Repin]].]]

All of Alexander III's internal reforms aimed to reverse the liberalization that had occurred in his father's reign. The new Emperor believed that remaining true to Russian [[Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality]] (the ideology introduced by his grandfather, emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]) would save Russia from revolutionary agitation. Alexander's political ideal was a nation composed of a single nationality, language, and religion, as well as one form of administration. He attempted to realize this by the institution of mandatory teaching of the [[Russian language]] throughout the empire, including to his [[Germans in Russia|German]], [[Poles|Polish]], and other non-Russian subjects (with the exception of the [[Finns]]), by the patronization of [[Eastern Orthodox]]y,  by the destruction of the remnants of German, Polish, and [[Sweden|Swedish]] institutions in the respective provinces, and by the weakening of [[Judaism]] through persecution of the [[Jew]]s. The latter policy was implemented in the &quot;[[May Laws]]&quot; of 1882, which banned Jews from inhabiting rural areas and [[shtetl]]s (even within the [[Pale of Settlement]]) and restricted the occupations in which they could engage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =This day, May 15, in Jewish history|url= http://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/cjnconnect/blogs/article_057a78b4-3f44-5375-a20d-a850a62b2194.html|publisher= Cleveland Jewish News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander weakened the power of the ''[[zemstvo]]'' (elective local administrative bodies resembling British [[Parish councils in England|parish council]]s) and placed the administration of peasant communes under the supervision of land-owning proprietors appointed by his government. These &quot;land captains&quot; (''zemskiye nachalniki'') were feared and resented throughout the Empire's peasant communities. These acts weakened the nobility and the peasantry and brought Imperial administration under the Emperor's personal control.

In such policies Alexander III had the encouragement of [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]], who retained control of the Church in Russia through his long tenure as Procurator of the Holy Synod (from 1880 to 1905) and who became tutor to Alexander's son and heir, Nicholas. (Pobedonostsev appears as &quot;Toporov&quot; in Tolstoy's novel ''Resurrection''.) Other conservative advisors included Count [[Dmitry Tolstoy|D. A. Tolstoy]] (minister of education, and later of internal affairs) and [[Ivan Durnovo|I. N. Durnovo]] (D. A. Tolstoy's successor in the latter post). [[Mikhail Katkov]] and other journalists supported the emperor in his autocracy.

Encouraged by its successful assassination of Alexander II, the [[Narodnaya Volya]] movement began planning the murder of Alexander III. The [[Okhrana]] uncovered the plot and five of the conspirators, including [[Alexander Ulyanov]], the older brother of [[Vladimir Lenin]], were captured and hanged on {{OldStyleDate|20 May|1887|8 May}}. On {{OldStyleDate|29 October|1888|17 October}} the Imperial train [[derailment|derailed]] in an [[Borki train disaster|accident]] at [[Borki, Kharkiv Oblast|Borki]]. At the moment of the crash, the imperial family was in the dining car. Its roof collapsed, and Alexander supposedly held its remains on his shoulders as the children fled outdoors. The onset of Alexander’s kidney failure was later attributed to the blunt trauma suffered in this incident.

The famine of 1891–1892 and the ensuing cholera epidemic permitted some liberal activity, as the Russian government could not cope with the crisis and had to allow zemstvos to help with relief (among others, [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] helped organize soup-kitchens, and [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] directed anti-cholera precautions in several villages).

[[File:Borki cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Borki Cathedral was one of many churches built all over the empire to commemorate the Tsar's &quot;miraculous&quot; survival in the train crash.]]

===Foreign policy===
In foreign affairs Alexander III was a man of peace, but not at any price, and held that the best means of averting war is to be well-prepared for it.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Though he was indignant at the conduct of German chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] towards Russia, he avoided an open rupture with [[German Empire|Germany]]&amp;mdash;even reviving the [[League of Three Emperors]] for a period of time{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=563}}&amp;mdash;and in 1887, signed the [[Reinsurance Treaty]] with the Germans. However, in 1890, the expiration of the treaty coincided with the dismissal of Bismarck by the new German emperor, [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] (for whom the Tsar had an immense dislike), and the unwillingness of Wilhelm II's government to renew the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Van Der Kiste, John ''The Romanovs: 1818–1959 ''(Sutton Publishing; 2003) p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; In response Alexander III then began cordial relations with France, eventually entering into an [[Franco-Russian Alliance|alliance]] with the French in 1892.

[[File:5 Roubles à l'effigie du Tsar d'Alexandre III, 1888.jpg|thumb|5-ruble coin of Alexander III, 1888]]

Despite chilly relations with Berlin, the Tsar nevertheless confined himself to keeping a large number of troops near the German frontier. With regard to Bulgaria he exercised similar self-control. The efforts of [[Alexander, Prince of Bulgaria|Prince Alexander]] and afterwards of [[Stefan Stambolov|Stambolov]] to destroy Russian influence in the principality roused his indignation, but he vetoed all proposals to intervene by force of arms.{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=563}}

In [[Central Asia]]n affairs he followed the traditional policy of gradually extending Russian domination without provoking conflict with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] (see [[Panjdeh Incident]]), and he never allowed the bellicose partisans of a forward policy to get out of hand. His reign cannot be regarded as an eventful period of [[History of Russia|Russian history]]; but under his hard rule the country made considerable progress.{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=563}}

Alexander and his wife regularly spent their summers at [[Langinkoski]] manor near [[Kotka]] on the [[Finland|Finnish]] coast, where their children were immersed in a Scandinavian lifestyle of relative modesty.

Alexander deprecated foreign influence, German influence in particular, thus the adoption of local national principles was off in all spheres of official activity, with a view to realizing his ideal of a Russia homogeneous in language, administration and religion. These ideas conflicted with those of his father, who had German sympathies despite being a patriot; Alexander II often used the German language in his private relations, occasionally ridiculed the [[Slavophiles]] and based his foreign policy on the Prussian alliance.{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=562}} [[File:Marble Palace (oriental frontage).jpg|thumb|Equestrian statue of Alexander III, by Prince [[Paolo Troubetzkoy]], shows the Emperor sitting heavily on the back of a ponderous horse]]

Some differences had first appeared during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], when Alexander II supported the cabinet of [[Berlin]] while the Tsesarevich made no effort to conceal his sympathies for the French. These sentiments would resurface during 1875-1879, when the [[Eastern Question]] excited Russian society. At first the Tsesarevich was more Slavophile than the government, but his [[phlegmatic]] nature restrained him from many exaggerations, and any popular illusions he may have imbibed were dispelled by personal observation in [[Bulgaria]], where he commanded the left wing of the invading army. Never consulted on political questions, Alexander confined himself to military duties and fulfilled them in a conscientious and unobtrusive manner. After many mistakes and disappointments, the army reached [[Constantinople]] and the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] was signed, but much that had been obtained by that important document had to be sacrificed at the [[Congress of Berlin]].{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=562}}

[[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] failed to do what was expected of him by the Russian emperor. In return for the Russian support which had enabled him to create the [[German Empire]], {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} it was thought that he would help Russia to solve the Eastern question in accordance with Russian interests, but to the surprise and indignation of the cabinet of Saint Petersburg he confined himself to acting the part of &quot;honest broker&quot; at the Congress, and shortly afterwards contracted an alliance with [[Austria-Hungary]] for the purpose of counteracting Russian designs in [[Eastern Europe]].{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=562}}

The Tsesarevich could refer to these results as confirmation of the views he had expressed during the Franco-Prussian War; he concluded that for Russia, the best thing was to recover as quickly as possible from her temporary exhaustion, and prepare for future contingencies by military and naval reorganization. In accordance with this conviction, he suggested that certain reforms should be introduced.{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=562}}

=== Family life ===
[[File:Tzar Alexander III and members of the Royal family.jpg|thumb|Left to Right: Emperor Alexander III, Prince George (later [[George V|George V of the United Kingdom]]), [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Marie Feodorovna]], [[Princess Maria of Greece and Denmark|Maria of Greece]], Tsesarevich Nicholas (Later Emperor [[Nicholas II of Russia]]). Probably taken on the imperial yacht near Denmark, {{Circa|c.}} 1893.]]
Following his father's assassination, Alexander III was advised that it would be difficult for him to be kept safe at the Winter Palace. As a result, Alexander relocated his family to the [[Gatchina Palace]], located twenty miles south of St. Petersburg, making it his primary residence. Under heavy guard he would make occasional visits into St. Petersburg, but even then he would stay in the [[Anichkov Palace]], as opposed to the Winter Palace.

In the 1860s Alexander fell madly in love with his mother's lady-in-waiting, Princess Maria Elimovna Meshcherskaya. Dismayed to learn that Prince Wittgenstein had proposed to her in spring 1866, he told his parents that he was prepared to give up his rights of succession in order to marry his beloved &quot;Dusenka&quot;. On 19 May 1866, Alexander II informed his son that Russia had come to an agreement with the parents of Princess Dagmar of Denmark, his fourth cousin. Before then, she had been the fiancée of his late elder brother Nicholas. At first Alexander refused to travel to Copenhagen, declaring that he did not love Dagmar and his desire to marry Maria. In response the enraged emperor ordered Alexander to go straight to Denmark and propose to Princess Dagmar. The Tsesarevich then realised that he was not a free man and that duty had to come first and foremost; the only thing left to do was to write in his diary &quot;Farewell, dear Dusenka.&quot; Maria was forced to leave Russia, accompanied by her aunt, Princess Chernyshova. Almost a year after her first appearance in Paris, [[Pavel Pavlovich Demidov, 2nd Prince of San Donato|Pavel Pavlovich Demidov, 2nd Prince di San Donato]], fell in love with her and the couple married in 1867. Maria would die giving birth to her son [[Elim Pavlovich Demidov, 3rd Prince of San Donato|Elim Pavlovich Demidov, 3rd Prince di San Donato]]. Alexander's reaction to the news of her death and the birth of her child is unknown.

Alexander soon grew fond of Dagmar and had six children by her, five of whom survived into adulthood: [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas]] (b. 1868), [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia|George]] (b. 1871), [[Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia|Xenia]] (b. 1875), [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Michael]] (b. 1878) and [[Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia|Olga]] (b. 1882). Of his five surviving children, he was closest to his youngest two.

Each summer his parents-in-law, [[King Christian IX of Denmark|King Christian IX]] and [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen Louise]], held family reunions at the Danish royal palaces of [[Fredensborg Palace|Fredensborg]] and [[Bernstorff Palace|Bernstorff]], bringing Alexander, Maria and their children to Denmark.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Van Der Kiste, John ''The Romanovs: 1818–1959 ''(Sutton Publishing, 2003), p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; His sister-in-law, the [[Queen Alexandra|Princess of Wales]], would come from Great Britain with some of her children, and his brother-in-law, [[King George I of Greece]], his wife, [[Queen Olga of Greece|Queen Olga]], who was a first cousin of Alexander and a Romanov Grand Duchess by birth, came with their children from Athens.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; In contrast to the strict security observed in Russia, Alexander and Maria revelled in the relative freedom that they enjoyed in Denmark, Alexander once commenting to the Prince and Princess of Wales near the end of a visit that he envied them being able to return to a happy home in England, while he was returning to his Russian prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Der Kiste, p. 152&quot;&gt;Van Der Kiste, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; In Denmark, he was able to enjoy joining his children in muddy ponds looking for tadpoles, sneaking into his father-in-law's orchard to steal apples, and playing pranks, such as turning a water hose on the visiting [[Oscar II of Sweden|King Oscar II of Sweden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Der Kiste, p. 152&quot;/&gt;

As Tsesarevich&amp;mdash;and then as Tsar&amp;mdash;Alexander had an extremely poor relationship with his brother [[Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Vladimir]]. This tension was reflected in the rivalry between Maria Feodorovna and Vladimir's wife, [[Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (Maria Pavlovna of Russia)|Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Der Kiste, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander had better relationships with his other brothers: [[Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia|Alexei]] (whom he made rear admiral and then a grand admiral of the Russian Navy), [[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia|Sergei]] (whom he made governor of Moscow) and [[Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia|Paul]].

Despite the antipathy that Alexander had towards his stepmother, [[Catherine Dolgorukov|Princess Catherine Dolgorukov]], he nevertheless allowed her to remain in the Winter Palace for some time after his father's assassination and to retain various keepsakes of him. These included Alexander II's blood-soaked uniform that he died wearing, and his reading glasses.&lt;ref&gt;
Van Der Kiste, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illness and death==
In 1894 Alexander III became ill with terminal kidney disease ([[nephritis]]). In the fall of that year, Maria Fyodorovna's sister-in-law, Queen Olga of Greece, offered her villa of [[Mon Repos, Corfu|Mon Repos]], on the island of [[Corfu]], in the hope that it might improve the Tsar's condition.&lt;ref&gt;King, Greg ''The Court of the Last Tsar: Pomp, Power and Pageantry in the Reign of Nicholas II ''(John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2006) p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the time that they reached [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]], they stayed at the Maly Palace in [[Livadia Palace|Livadia]], as Alexander was too weak to travel any further.&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing that the Tsar's days were numbered, various imperial relatives began to descend on Livadia. Even the famed clergyman, [[John of Kronstadt]], paid a visit and administered Communion to the Tsar.&lt;ref&gt;John Perry &amp; Constantine Pleshakov ''The Flight of the Romanovs: a Family Saga ''(Basic Books, 1999) p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 October, Alexander received Nicholas's fiancée, Princess Alix, who had come from her native Darmstadt to receive the Tsar's blessing.&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being exceedingly weak, Alexander insisted on receiving Alix in full dress uniform, an event that left him exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, his health began to deteriorate more rapidly. He eventually died in the arms of his wife at Maly Palace in Livadia on the afternoon of {{OldStyleDate|1 November|1894|20 October}} at the age of forty-nine, and was succeeded by his eldest son Tsesarevich Nicholas, who took the throne as [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]. After leaving Livadia on 6 November and traveling to St. Petersburg by way of Moscow, his remains were interred on 18 November at the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]].

==Issue==
[[File:1888. Семья императора Александра III.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Alexander III with his wife and their children]]

Alexander III had six children (five of whom survived to adulthood) of his marriage with [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Princess Dagmar of Denmark]], also known as Marie Feodorovna.

==Monuments==
[[File:The monument of Russian Emperor Alexander III.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial dedicated to the Russian Emperor Alexander III in Pullapää, [[Estonia]]]]
In 1909 a bronze [[equestrian statue]] of Alexander III sculpted by [[Paolo Troubetzkoy]] was placed in [[Znamenskaya Square]] in front of the [[Moskovsky Rail Terminal (Saint Petersburg)|Moscow Rail Terminal]] in [[St. Petersburg]]. Both the horse and rider were sculpted in massive form, leading to the nickname of &quot;hippopotamus&quot;. Troubetzkoy envisioned the statue as a [[caricature]], jesting that he wished &quot;to portray an animal atop another animal&quot;, and it was quite controversial at the time, with many, including the members of the Imperial Family, opposed to the design, but it was approved because of the [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Empress Dowager]] unexpectedly liking the monument. Following the Revolution of 1917 the statue remained in place as a symbol of tsarist autocracy until 1937 when it was placed in storage. In 1994 it was again put on public display, in front of the [[Marble Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Orlando|last=Figes|page=15|title=A People's Tragedy|ISBN=0-7126-7327-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another memorial is located in the city of [[Irkutsk]] at the [[Angara River|Angara]] embankment.
