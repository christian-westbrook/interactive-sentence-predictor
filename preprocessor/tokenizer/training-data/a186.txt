The country spans {{convert|28,748|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}} and had a total population of almost 3 million people {{As of|2016|lc=y}}. Albania is located in the southwestern part of the [[Balkan Peninsula]], bordered by [[Montenegro]] to the northwest, [[Kosovo]]{{efn|name=status}} to the northeast, the [[Republic of Macedonia]] to the east, and [[Greece]] to the south and southeast. The country has a coastline on the northern shore of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the west and the [[Ionian Sea]] to the southwest, forming the [[Albanian Riviera]]. Albania is less than {{convert|72|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from [[Italy]], across the [[Strait of Otranto]] which connects the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the [[Ionian Sea]]. Albania is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[constitutional republic]] with the capital in [[Tirana]], the country's largest city and main economic and commercial centre, followed by [[Durrës]]. The country's other major cities include [[Vlorë]], [[Sarandë]], [[Shkodër]], [[Berat]], [[Korçë]], [[Gjirokastër]] and [[Fier]].

During the [[Classical antiquity|classical times]], Albania was inhabited by various ancient [[Illyrians|Illyrian]], [[Thracians|Thracian]] and [[Chaonians|Greek]] tribes, as well as several Greek colonies established inside the Illyrian coast. In the third century BC, the region was annexed by [[Roman Empire|Rome]] and became part of the Roman provinces of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] and [[Moesia Superior]]. The unified [[Principality of Arbër]] emerged in 1190, established by [[archon]] [[Progon, Lord of Kruja|Progon]] in the [[Krujë]], within the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In the late twelfth century, [[Charles of Anjou]] conquered the Albanian territories from the Byzantines and established the medieval [[Kingdom of Albania (medieval)|Kingdom of Albania]], extending from [[Durrës]] along the coast to [[Butrint]] in the south. Falling in the mid-fifteenth century under [[Ottoman Albania|Ottoman dominion]], the modern nation state of Albania [[Declaration of independence of Albania|emerged]] in 1912 following the collapse of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Balkan Wars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/al.html |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |title=The World Factbook: Albania |accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern [[Kingdom of Albania (1928–39)|Kingdom of Albania]] was invaded by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] in 1939, which formed [[Albanian Kingdom (1939–43)|Greater Albania]], before becoming a [[Albanian Kingdom (1943–44)|Nazi German]] protectorate in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t7KNgpZRnM8C&amp;pg=PA181&amp;dq=Albania+nazi+protectorate&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SK4FUderL-rW2wX36ICwCg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Albania%20nazi%20protectorate&amp;f=false |title=Invoking Humanity: War, Law and Global Order |last=Zolo |first=D. |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |page=180 |publication-date=27 August 2002|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, a [[Socialist state|socialist]] [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|People's Republic]] emerged under the leadership of [[Enver Hoxha]] and the [[Party of Labour of Albania|Party of Labour]]. The country experienced widespread social and political transformations in the communist era, as well as isolation from much of the international community.

== Etymology ==
{{Main|Names of the Albanians and Albania|l1=Etymology of Albania}}

The term Albania is the [[Medieval Latin|medieval latin]] name of the country. It may be derived from the [[Illyrian tribe]] of [[Albani (Illyrian tribe)|Albani]] (''{{lang-sq|Albanët}}'') recorded by [[Ptolemy]], the geographer and astronomer from [[Alexandria]], who drafted a map in 150&amp;nbsp;AD, which shows the city of [[Albanopolis]] located northeast of the city of [[Durrës]].&lt;ref&gt;Madrugearu A, Gordon M. The wars of the [[Balkan Peninsula]]. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2007. p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Barrington|49 &amp; notes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term may have a continuation in the name of a medieval settlement called [[Principality of Arbanon|Albanon]] or Arbanon, although it is not certain that this was the same place.&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians by J. J. Wilkes, 1992, {{ISBN|978-0-631-19807-9}}, page 279,&quot;We cannot be certain that the Arbanon of Anna Comnena is the same as Albanopolis of the Albani, a place located on the map of Ptolemy (3.12)&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
In his history written in the 10th century, the [[byzantine]] historian [[Michael Attaliates]] was the first to refer to [[Albanoi]] as having taken part in a revolt against [[Constantinople]] in 1043 and to the Arbanitai as subjects of the Duke of [[Dyrrachium]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Elsei. ''The Albanian lexicon of Dion Von Kirkman. Earliest reference to the existence of the Albanian language'', pp. 113–122.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Albanians|Albanian]]s called their country (''{{lang|sq|Arbëri or Arbëni}}'') and referred to themselves as (''{{lang|sq|[[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]] or Arbëneshë}}'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinocacozza.it/ Pinocacozza.it {{sq icon}}] {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-arberesh.eu/|title=Radio-Arberesh.eu|author=Casanova|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowaday, [[Albanians]] call their country Shqipëri or Shqipëria. As early as the 17th century the placename (''{{lang-sq|Shqipëria}}'') and the ethnic demonym (''{{lang|sq|Shqiptarë}}'') gradually replaced (''{{lang|sq|Arbëria and Arbëresh}}''). The two terms are [[folk etymology|popularly]] interpreted as &quot;Land of the Eagles&quot; and &quot;Children of the Eagles&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kristo Frasheri. ''History of Albania (A Brief Overview)''. Tirana, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mirror.undp.org/albania/download/pdf/albanian.pdf|title=The Albanian Language |last=Lloshi|first=Xhevat|publisher=United Nations Development Programme|accessdate=9 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shpella e zeze - Pellumbas.jpg|thumb|left|Ancient cave in Pëllumbas near the capital city of [[Tirana]].]]

The first traces of human presence in Albania, dating to the [[Middle Paleolithic]] and [[Upper Paleolithic]] eras, were found in the village of Xarrë, near [[Sarandë]] and [[Mount Dajt]] near [[Tiranë]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Prendi&quot;&gt;F. Prendi, &quot;The Prehistory of Albania&quot;, ''The Cambridge Ancient History'', 2nd edn., vol. 3, part 1: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vXljf8JqmkoC&amp;pg=PA187 The Prehistory of the Balkans; and the Middle East and the Aegean World, Tenth to Eighth Centuries B.C.]'', ed. John Boardman et al. (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1982), 189–90.&lt;/ref&gt; The objects found in a cave near Xarrë include flint and jasper objects and fossilized animal bones, while those found at Mount Dajt comprise bone and stone tools similar to those of the [[Aurignacian culture]]. The Paleolithic finds of Albania show great similarities with objects of the same era found at Crvena Stijena in Montenegro and north-western Greece.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prendi&quot;/&gt;

Several [[Bronze Age]] artefacts from [[tumulus]] burials have been unearthed in central and southern Albania that show close connection with sites in south-western [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Lefkada]], Greece. Archaeologists have come to the conclusion that these regions were inhabited from the middle of the third millennium BC by [[Indo-European migrations|Indo-European]] people who spoke a [[Proto-Greek language]]. A part of this population later moved to [[Mycenae]] around 1600 BC and founded the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilisation]] there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hammond |first=N. G.

The [[Kingdom of Albania (medieval)|Kingdom of Albania]] ''(Mbretëria e Arbërisë)'' was established by [[Charles I of Naples|Charles of Anjou]] ''(Karli Anzhu)'' in the Albanian territory. In 1271, he conquered from the [[Despotate of Epirus]]. One year later in February 1272, he took the title of [[Kingdom of Albania (medieval)|King of Albania]]. The kingdom extended from the region of [[Dyrrhachium]] (modern [[Durrës]]), south along the coast to [[Butrint]]. After the creation of the kingdom, a catholic political structure was a basis for the papal plans of spreading Catholicism in the Balkans. This plan found also the support of [[Helen of Anjou]], a cousin of [[Charles I of Naples|Charles of Anjou]], who was at that time ruling territories in North Albania. Around 30 catholic churches and monasteries were built during her rule in North Albania and also in Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Regnum Albaniae, the Papal Curia, and the Western Visions of a Borderline Nobility|last = Etleva|first = Lala|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2008|pages = |url = http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2009/mphlae01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1331 to 1355, the [[Serbian Empire]] wrestled control over Albania. After the dissolution of the Serbian Empire, several [[Albanian principalities]] were created, and among the most powerful were the [[Balsha]], [[Thopia family|Thopia]], [[Kastrioti Principality|Kastrioti]], [[Muzaka family|Muzaka]] and [[Arianiti family|Arianiti]]. In the first half of the 14th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] invaded most of Albania. In 1444, the Albanian principalities were united under [[Skanderbeg|George Castrioti Skanderbeg]] ''(Gjergj Kastrioti Skënderbeu)'', who became the national hero of the Albanian medieval history.

At the dawn of the establishment of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in southeastern [[Europe]], the geopolitical landscape was marked by scattered kingdoms of small principalities. The Ottomans erected their garrisons throughout southern Albania in 1415 and occupied most of the country in 1431.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Licursi |first=Emiddio Pietro|title=Empire of Nations: The Consolidation of Albanian and Turkish National Identities in the Late Ottoman Empire, 1878–1913 |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/72122169/7/Pashko-Vasa|accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |origyear=|year=2011 |publisher= Columbia University |location= New York |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |doi_inactivedate= |bibcode= |id=|page=19 |pages= |nopp= |at= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= By 1415, after a chaotic interregnum, Sultan Mehmet I sent the military to erect the first Ottoman garrisons throughout southern Albania, establishing direct military authority in the region&amp;nbsp;... l jurisdiction over most of Albania&amp;nbsp;...|hdl=10022/AC:P:10297}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1443 a great and longstanding [[History of the Albanian-Turkish Wars|revolt]] broke out under the lead of the Albanian national hero [[Skanderbeg|George Castrioti Skanderbeg]] ''(Gjergj Kastrioti Skënderbeu)'', which lasted until 1479, many times defeating major [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] armies led by the sultans [[Murad II]] and [[Mehmed II]]. Skanderbeg united initially the Albanian princes, and later on established a centralized authority over most of the non-conquered territories, becoming the ruling ''Lord of Albania''. He also tried relentlessly but rather unsuccessfully to create a European coalition against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s. He thwarted every attempt by the Turks to regain Albania, which they envisioned as a springboard for the invasion of [[Italy]] and western [[Europe]]. His unequal fight against the mightiest power of the time, won the esteem of Europe as well as some support in the form of money and military aid from [[Naples]], [[Venice]], [[Ragusa, Sicily|Ragusa]] and the [[Papacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12472/Albania/42646/The-decline-of-Byzantium|title=Albania :: The decline of Byzantium |work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With the arrival of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s, [[Islam in Albania|Islam]] was introduced in the country as a third religion.

During the 15th century, when the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s were gaining a firm foothold in the region, Albanian towns were organised into four principal [[sanjaks]]. The government fostered trade by settling a sizeable Jewish colony of refugees fleeing persecution in [[Spain]] (at the end of the 15th century). The city of [[Vlorë]] saw passing through its ports imported merchandise from Europe such as velvets, cotton goods, mohairs, carpets, spices, and leather from [[Bursa]] and [[Constantinople]]. Some citizens of [[Vlorë]] even had business associates throughout [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=Arnawutlu/&gt;

[[Albanians|Albanian]]s could also be found throughout the empire in [[Iraq]], [[Egypt]], [[Algeria]] and across the [[Maghreb]], as vital military and administrative retainers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norris|first=H.

This was partly due to the [[Devşirme]] system. The process of Islamization was an incremental one, commencing from the arrival of the Ottomans in the 14th century (to this day, a minority of Albanians are Catholic or Orthodox Christians, though the vast majority became Muslim). [[Timar]] holders, the bedrock of early Ottoman control in southeast Europe, were not necessarily converts to Islam, and occasionally rebelled; the most famous of these rebels is [[Skanderbeg]] (his figure would rise up later on, in the 19th century, as a central component of the Albanian national identity). The most significant impact on the [[Albanians|Albanian]]s was the gradual Islamisation process of a large majority of the population, although it became widespread only in the 17th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;referenceworks.brillonline&quot;/&gt;

Mainly [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] converted in the 17th century, while the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Albanians followed suit mainly in the following century. Initially confined to the main city centres of [[Elbasan]] and [[Shkodër]], by this period the countryside was also embracing the new religion. The motives for conversion according to some scholars were diverse, depending on the context. The lack of source material does not help when investigating such issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;referenceworks.brillonline&quot;/&gt; Albania remained under Ottoman control as part of the [[Rumelia]] province until 1912, when [[independent Albania]] was [[Albanian Declaration of Independence|declared]].

The National Renaissance ''(Rilindja Kombëtare)'' began in the 1870s and lasted until 1912, when the [[Albanians|Albanian]]s declared their [[Declaration of independence of Albania|independence]]. The [[League of Prizren]] (League for the Defense of the Rights of the Albanian Nation) ''(Lidhja e Prizrenit)'' was formed on June 1878, in the old town of [[Prizren]], [[Kosovo Vilayet]].

[[File:Wedding of Ahmet Zogu 1938.jpg|thumb|left|Wedding of [[Zog I of Albania|Zog I]] with [[Geraldine of Albania]] in 1938.]]

The short-lived [[Principality of Albania|principality]] (1914–1925) was succeeded by the first [[Albanian Republic]] (1925–1928). In 1925 the four-member Regency was abolished and [[Zog I of Albania|Ahmed Zogu]] was elected president of the newly declared republic. [[Tirana]] was endorsed officially as the country's permanent capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Albanians: A Modern History|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IzI0uOZ2j6gC|publisher = I.B.Tauris|date = 1 January 1999|isbn = 978-1-86064-541-9|first = Miranda|last = Vickers|page = 118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zogu led an authoritarian and conservative regime, the primary aim of which was the maintenance of stability and order. Zogu was forced to adopt a policy of cooperation with Italy. A pact had been signed between Italy and Albania on 20 January 1925 whereby Italy gained a monopoly on shipping and trade concessions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vickers&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Albanians: A Modern History|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IzI0uOZ2j6gC|publisher = I.B.Tauris|date = 1 January 1999|isbn = 978-1-86064-541-9|first = Miranda|last = Vickers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Albanian republic was eventually replaced by another [[Kingdom of Albania (1928–39)|monarchy]] in 1928. In order to extend his direct control throughout the entire country, Zogu placed great emphasis on the construction of roads. Every male Albanian over the age of 16 years was legally bound to give ten days of free labor each year to the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vickers&quot;/&gt; King Zogu remained a conservative, but initiated reforms. For example, in an attempt at social modernization, the custom of adding one's region to one's name was dropped. Zogu also made donations of land to international organisations for the building of schools and hospitals. The armed forces were trained and supervised by Italian instructors. As a counterweight, Zogu kept British officers in the [[Gendarmerie]] despite strong Italian pressure to remove them. The kingdom was supported by the [[Italian Fascism|fascist regime in Italy]] and the two countries maintained close relations until Italy's sudden [[Italian invasion of Albania|invasion of the country]] in 1939. Albania was occupied by [[Italian Fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Albanian Kingdom (1943–1944)|then]] by [[Nazi Germany]] during World War II.

The party at first had little mass appeal, and even its youth organization netted few recruits.

After the capitulation of Italy in 1943, Nazi Germany occupied Albania too. The nationalist [[Balli Kombëtar|Balli Kombetar]], which had fought against Italy, formed a &quot;neutral&quot; government in Tirana, and side by side with the Germans fought against the communist-led [[National Liberation Movement (Albania)|National Liberation Movement of Albania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Morrock2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Morrock|first=Richard|title=The Psychology of Genocide and Violent Oppression: A Study of Mass Cruelty from Nazi Germany to Rwanda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CZtnAbKkOmIC&amp;pg=PA55|date=11 October 2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5628-4|page=55|quote=The nationalist Balli Kombetar, which had fought against Italy, made a deal with the German invaders, and formed a &quot;neutral&quot; government in Tirana which&amp;nbsp;...}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center for Relief to Civilian Populations (Geneva) reported that Albania was one of the most devastated countries in Europe. 60,000 houses were destroyed and about 10% of the population was left homeless. The communist partisans had regrouped and gained control of much of southern Albania in January 1944. However, they were subject to German attacks driving them out of certain areas. In the Congress of Përmet, the NLF formed an Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation to act as Albania's administration and legislature. By the last year in World War II Albania fell into a civil war-like state between the communists and nationalists. The communist partisans however defeated the last Balli Kombëtar forces in southern Albania by mid-summer 1944. Before the end of November, the main German troops had withdrawn from [[Tirana]], and the communists took control by attacking it. The partisans entirely liberated Albania from German occupation on 29 November 1944. A provisional government, which the communists had formed at&amp;nbsp;Berat&amp;nbsp;in October, administered Albania with Enver Hoxha as prime minister.

After the liberation of Albania from the [[Albanian resistance during World War II|Nazi occupation]], the country became a [[Communist state]]. Afterwards, the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|People's Republic of Albania]] ''(renamed &quot;People's Socialist Republic of Albania&quot; in 1976)'' was founded, which was led by [[Enver Hoxha]] and the [[Labour Party of Albania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Envery Hoxha|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Enver-Hoxha|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The socialist reconstruction of Albania was launched immediately after the annulling of the monarchy and the establishment of a [[People's Republic]]. In 1947, Albania's first railway line was completed, with the second one being completed eight months later. New land reform laws were passed granting ownership of the land to the workers and peasants who tilled it. Agriculture became [[Worker cooperative|cooperative]], and production increased significantly, leading to Albania's becoming agriculturally self-sufficient. By 1955, illiteracy was eliminated among Albania's adult population.&lt;ref&gt;''40 Years of Socialist Albania'', Dhimiter Picani&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freedom of religion in Albania|Religious freedoms]] were severely curtailed during the communist regime, with all forms of worship being outlawed. In August 1945, the ''Agrarian Reform Law'' meant that large swaths of property owned by religious groups (mostly Islamic [[waqfs]]) were nationalized, along with the estates of monasteries and dioceses. Many believers, along with the [[ulema]] and many [[priests]], were arrested and executed. In 1949, a new Decree on Religious Communities required that all their activities be sanctioned by the state alone.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress Country Studies, Albania: Hoxha's Antireligious Campaign&lt;/ref&gt;

After hundreds of mosques and dozens of Islamic libraries, containing priceless manuscripts, were destroyed, [[Enver Hoxha]] proclaimed Albania the &quot;World's first [[State atheism|atheist state]]&quot; in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Kombësia dhe feja në Shqipëri, 1920–1944 / Roberto Morocco dela Roka ; e përktheu nga origjinali Luan Omari.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsie p27&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Albania|last=Elsie|first=Robert|publisher=[[The Scarecrow Press]]|year=2010|isbn=978-0-8108-6188-6|edition=2nd|series=Historical Dictionaries of Europe, No. 75|location=Lanham, MD, and Plymouth|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=haFlGXIg8uoC&amp;pg=PA27 27]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The churches had not been spared either, and many were converted into cultural centers for young people. A 1967 law banned all &quot;fascist, religious, warmongerish, antisocialist activity and propaganda&quot;. Preaching religion carried a three to ten-year prison sentence. Nonetheless, many Albanians continued to practice their beliefs secretly. The Hoxha dictatorship's anti-religious policy attained its most fundamental legal and political expression a decade later: &quot;The state recognizes no religion,&quot; states Albania's 1976 constitution, &quot;and supports and carries out atheistic propaganda in order to implant a scientific materialistic world outlook in people.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsie p27&quot;/&gt; [[Enver Hoxha]]'s political successor, [[Ramiz Alia]] oversaw the dismemberment of the &quot;[[Hoxhaist]]&quot; state during the collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]] in the late 1980s.

[[File:Tirana Square 1988.jpg|thumb|left|In 1988, the first outsiders were allowed to walk into the [[Skanderbeg Square]], the main plaza in [[Tirana]].]]

After the [[Revolutions of 1989|revolution of 1989]], reforms were made by the communist government in 1990. Subsequently, the [[People's Republic of Albania|People's Republic]] was dissolved and the 4th [[Independent Albania|Albanian Republic]] was founded on 29 April 1991. The communists retained a stronghold in the [[Parliament of Albania|Parliament]], after popular support in the first [[multi-party elections]] in [[Albanian parliamentary election, 1991|1991]]. In March 1992, amid liberalization policies resulting in economic collapse and social unrest, a new coalition led by the new [[Democratic Party of Albania|Democratic Party]] took power after victory in the [[Albanian parliamentary election, 1992|parliamentary elections]] of 1992.

In the following years, much of the accumulated wealth of the country was invested in [[Ponzi scheme|Ponzi]] pyramid banking schemes, which were widely supported by the [[Government of Albania|government]]. The schemes swept up somewhere between one sixth and one third of the [[Demographics of Albania|Albanian population]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jarvis, Christopher|year=2000|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2000/03/jarvis.htm |title=The Rise and Fall of the Albanian Pyramid Schemes|journal=Finance and Development|volume= 37|issue=1|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bezemer, Dirk|year=2001|title=Post-socialist Financial Fragility: The Case of Albania|journal=Cambridge Journal of Economics|volume=25|pages= 1–25|doi=10.1093/cje/25.1.1|jstor=23599718|hdl=10419/85494|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the [[International Monetary Fund|International Monetary Fund (IMF)]] warnings in late 1996, [[President of Albania|President]] [[Sali Berisha]] defended the schemes as large investment firms, leading more people to redirect their remittances and sell their homes and cattle for cash to deposit in the schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Musaraj, Smoki|year= 2011|title=Tales from Albarado: The Materiality of Pyramid Schemes in Post-socialist Albania|journal=Cultural Anthropology|volume= 26|issue=1|pages=84–110|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1360.2010.01081.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The schemes began to collapse in late 1996, leading many of the investors to join initially peaceful protests against the government, requesting their money back. The protests turned violent in February 1997 as government forces responded with fire. In March, the Police and Republican Guard deserted, leaving their armories open. These were promptly emptied by militias and criminal gangs. The [[1997 rebellion in Albania|resulting crisis]] caused a wave of evacuations of foreign nationals and of refugees.&lt;ref&gt;For the most part, the [[Albanian diaspora|Albanian refugees]] emigrated to [[Albanians in Italy|Italy]], [[Albanian communities in Greece|Greece]], [[Albanians in Switzerland|Switzerland]], [[Albanians in Germany|Germany]], or North America.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis led [[Prime Minister of Albania|Prime Minister]] [[Aleksandër Meksi]] to resign on 11 March 1997, followed by [[President of Albania|President]] [[Sali Berisha]] in July in the wake of the June General Election. In April 1997, [[Operation Alba]], a [[United Nations|UN]] peacekeeping force led by [[Italy]], entered the country with two goals: to assist with the evacuation of expatriates and to secure the ground for international organizations. The main international organization involved was the [[Western European Union]]'s [[Albanian civil war of 1997#International intervention|Multinational Albanian Police element (MAPE)]], which worked with the government to restructure the [[Judicial system of Albania|judicial system]] and the [[Albanian Police]]. The [[Socialist Party of Albania|Socialist Party]] had won the previously mentioned [[Albanian parliamentary election, 1997|parliamentary elections in June 1997]], and a degree of political stabilization followed. In 1999, the country was affected by the [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Kosovo War]], which caused a great number of ethnic [[Kosovo Albanians|Albanian]]s from [[Kosovo]] to seek refuge in Albania, although most ultimately returned to Kosovo.

On 23 June 2013, the eighth [[Albanian parliamentary election, 2013|parliamentary elections]] took place, won by [[Edi Rama]] of the [[Socialist Party of Albania|Socialist Party]]. During his tenure as [[List of Prime Ministers of Albania|33rd]] [[Prime Minister of Albania|Prime Minister]], Albania has implemented numerous reforms focused on the [[Modernism|modernizing]] the [[Economy of Albania|economy]] and democratizing of [[State institution|state institutions]] like the [[Judiciary of Albania|judiciary]] and [[Law enforcement in Albania|law enforcement]].

After the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of the Eastern Bloc]], Albania started to develop closer ties with Western Europe. At the [[2008 Bucharest summit]], the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)]] invited Albania to join the alliance. In April 2014 Albania became a full member of [[NATO]].

According to the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen system]], Albania hosts five major climatic subtypes. These include [[Mediterranean climate|mediterranean]], [[Humid subtropical climate|subtropical]], [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]], [[Humid continental climate|continental]] and [[Subarctic climate|subarctic]]. With its coastline facing the [[Adriatic Sea]] and [[Ionian Sea]] in the west, Albania's highlands backed upon the elevated [[Balkan|Balkan landmass]], and the entire country lying at a latitude subject to a variety of weather patterns during the winter and summer seasons. The climate on the coasts is typically [[Mediterranean climate|mediterranean]], while in the highlands it is [[Continental climate|continental]]. In both the [[Western Lowlands|western lowlands]] and the inner highlands, the weather varies from north to south. The lowlands have mild winters, averaging about {{convert|7|°C|0|abbr=on}}, while summer temperatures average {{convert|24|°C|0|abbr=on}}. In the southern lowlands, temperatures average about {{convert|5|C-change|0|abbr=on}} higher throughout the year. The difference is greater than {{convert|5|C-change|0|abbr=on}} during the summer and somewhat less during the winter.

Inland conditions vary depending on [[elevation]], but the higher areas above {{convert|1524|m|abbr=off}} in the [[Northern Mountain Range, Albania|northern]] and [[Central Mountain Range, Albania|central highlands]] are rather cold and frequently snowy in winter; here cold conditions with snow may linger into spring. The temperatures are affected more by differences in elevation than by latitude or any other factor. Average summer temperatures are lower than in the coastal areas and much lower at higher elevations, but daily fluctuations are greater.[[File:Maja e Thatë (2406 m) in the Albanian Alps.jpg|thumb|right|[[Subarctic climate]] on [[Albanian Alps]] {{legend|#007E7D}}]] Average [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is heavy, a result of the convergence of the prevailing airflow from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the continental air mass.Because they usually meet at the point where the terrain rises, the heaviest rain falls in the [[Central Mountain Range, Albania|central highlands]]. When the continental air mass is weak, Mediterranean winds drop their moisture farther inland. When there is a dominant continental air mass, cold air spills onto the lowland areas, which occurs most frequently in the winter.

Lowland rainfall averages from {{convert|1000|mm|in|1|sp=us}} to more than {{convert|1500|mm|in|1|sp=us}} annually, with the higher levels in the north. Nearly 95% of the rain falls in the winter. Rainfall in the northern highlands is heavier. Adequate records are not available, and estimates vary widely, but annual averages are probably about {{convert|1800|mm|in|1|sp=us}} and are as high as {{convert|2550|mm|in|1|sp=us}}. However, the western [[Albanian Alps]] are among the wettest areas in [[Europe]], receiving some {{convert|3100|mm|1|abbr=on}} of rain annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qendrim.forumotion.net/gjeografia-f61/tiparet-e-pergjithshme-te-klimes-t3725.htm |title=Tiparet e pergjithshme te klimes |publisher=Qendrim.forumotion.net |date=20 December 2009 |accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seasonal variation is not quite as great in the coastal area. The central highlands receive less precipitation than the intermediate northern highlands. Terrain differences cause wide local variations, but the seasonal distribution is the most consistent of any area. In 2009, an expedition from the [[University of Colorado]] discovered four small [[glacier]]s inside the Albanian Alps. The glaciers are at the relatively low level of {{convert|2000|m|ft}}, almost unique for such a southerly latitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://instaar.metapress.com/content/273213h3t4370272/ |title=Twenty-first Century Glaciers and Climate in the Prokletije Mountains, Albania Journal Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research Publisher Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, University of Colorado ISSN 1523-0430 (Print) 1938–4246 (Online) Issue Volume 41, Number 4 / November 2009 DOI 10.1657/1938-4246-41.4.455 Pages 455–459 Online Date: 30 November 2009|publisher=Instaar.metapress.com |date=30 November 2009 |accessdate=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politics in Albania operate under a framework laid out in the [[Constitution of Albania]]. First in 1913, Albania was constituted as a [[monarchy]], briefly a [[republic]] in 1920, then into a [[Democratic Monarchy|democratic monarchy]] in 1928. Succeeding, it became a [[socialist republic]], until the restoration of capitalism and democracy, after the [[collapse of communism in Albania|collapse of communism]]. Nowadays, Albania is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[constitutional republic]] in which the [[President of Albania|President]] serves as the [[head of state]] and the [[Prime Minister of Albania|Prime Minister]] as the [[head of government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Albania 1998 (rev. 2008)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Albania_2008?lang=en|website=Constitute|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The President is the [[head of state]], [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Albanian Armed Forces|military]] and the representative of the unity of the [[Albanians|Albanian]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KUSHTETUTA E REPUBLIKËS SË SHQIPËRISË|url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/sq/al/al057sq.pdf|website=wipo.int|page=Article 86.1|language=Albanian|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President is [[Election|elected]] to a five-year [[Term of office|term]] by the [[Parliament of Albania|Parliament]] by a majority of three-fifths of all its members. The President has the power to guarantee observation of the [[Constitution of Albania|Constitution]] and all laws, exercise the duties of the Parliament when it is not in session, and appoints the Prime Minister. Ministers are also nominated by the President on the basis of the Prime Minister's recommendation. The [[executive power]] is exercised by the Prime Minister and the [[Council of Ministers of Albania|Council of Ministers]] which make up the government. The Parliament must give final approval of the composition of the Cabinet. The Prime Minister is responsible for carrying out both foreign and domestic policies, directs and controls the activities of the ministries and other state organs.

[[File:Tirana - Albanian National Assembly (by Pudelek).jpg|thumb|right|The façade of the [[Parliament of Albania]] in [[Tirana]].]]

The Parliament is the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Representative democracy|representative body]] of the citizens of Albania and is [[Legislative elections in Albania|elected]] by people to a four-year [[Term of office|term]] on the basis of direct, universal, periodic and equal [[suffrage]] by [[secret ballot]]. There are 140 deputies in the Parliament, which are elected through a [[party-list proportional representation]] system. The [[Chairman of the Parliament of Albania|Chairperson]] has two deputies and chairs the Parliament. There are 15 permanent committees. The Parliament has the power to decide the direction of domestic and foreign policy; approve or amend the constitution; declare war on another state; ratify or annul international treaties; elect the [[President of Albania|President]], the [[Supreme Court of Albania|Supreme Court]], and the Attorney General and their deputies; and control the activity of state radio and television, state news agency and other official information media.

The [[Judiciary of Albania|judicial system]] of Albania is a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system divided between courts with regular civil and criminal jurisdiction and administrative courts. It is codified and based on the [[Napoleonic Code|French law]]. Major institutions of the branch include the [[Supreme Court of Albania|Supreme Court]], [[Constitutional Court of Albania|Constitutional Court]], [[Appeals courts of Albania|Court of Appeal]], and the [[Administrative Courts in Albania|Administrative Court]]. Law enforcement in the country is primarily the responsibility of the [[Albanian Police]]. It is the main and largest state law enforcement agency in the country. It carries nearly all general police duties thath includes criminal investigation, patrol activity, traffic policing and border control.

Albania has a network of 40 [[List of diplomatic missions in Albania|foreign embassies]] and 46 [[Diplomatic missions in Albania|diplomatic missions]] abroad.

Albania has been a member of the [[United Nations]] since December 1955. Three years later in 1958, it became member of [[UNESCO]]. Albania took on the membership of the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] from 2005 to 2007 and for the second time in 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECOSOC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs (Albania)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]|title=Albania and the United Nations 60 Years of Partnership|url=http://www.punetejashtme.gov.al/files/userfiles/press_brochure_minfor_(2).pdf|website=punetejashtme.gov.al|page=9|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to that, Albania served as vice president of the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|ECOSOC]] in 2006 and 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECOSOC&quot;/&gt; In 2014, it also joined the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] from 2015 to 2017 and was elected vice president in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs (Albania)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]|title=Albania and the United Nations 60 Years of Partnership|url=http://www.punetejashtme.gov.al/files/userfiles/press_brochure_minfor_(2).pdf|website=punetejashtme.gov.al|page=13|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albania was among the first [[eastern Europe]]an countries to join the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)]]. Major Albanian politicians considered admission to NATO as a top priority for the country. Since 1992, it has been extensively engaged with NATO, and has maintained its position as a stability factor and a strong ally of the [[United States]] and [[European Union]] in the troubled and divided region of the Balkans.

Besides, Albania is a full member of numerous international organizations, namely the [[United Nations]], [[Council of Europe]], [[International Organization for Migration]], [[World Health Organization]], [[Union for the Mediterranean]], [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]], [[International Monetary Fund]], [[World Trade Organization]] and [[La Francophonie]].

== Administrative divisions ==
{{Main articles|Counties of Albania|Municipalities of Albania|l1=Counties}}

With a total area of {{convert|28748|km2|0|abbr=off}}, Albania is divided into twelve [[Administrative divisions of Albania|administrative]] counties (''{{lang-sq|Qarqe}}''). The counties are further subdivided into 61 [[Municipalities of Albania|municipalities]] (''{{lang|sq|Bashkia}}''). In addition, the counties were further subdivided in 36 districts (''{{lang|sq|Rrethe}}''), which became defunct in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;terref&quot;&gt;[http://www.reformaterritoriale.al/en/roadmap/history A Brief History of the Administrative-territorial Organization in Albania] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524170836/http://www.reformaterritoriale.al/en/roadmap/history |date=24 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The counties were created on 31 July 2000 to replace the thirty-six former [[Districts of Albania|district]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of the Administrative-territorial Organization in Albania|url=http://www.reformaterritoriale.al/en/reform/history|website=reformaterritoriale.al|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government introduced a new administrative division to be implemented in 2015, whereby municipalities were reduced to 61, while rural ones called (''{{lang|sq|Komuna}}'') are abolished. The defunct municipalities are known as Neighborhoods or Villages (''{{lang|sq|Lagje or Fshat}}'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.top-channel.tv/lajme/artikull.php?id=292404|title=Ndarja administrative, njësitë vendore në lagje dhe fshatra}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shekulli.com.al/web/p.php?id=38109&amp;kat=88|title=Ndarja e re, mbeten 28 bashki, shkrihen komunat –  Shekulli Online|publisher=|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are overall 2980 villages or communities in the entire country, formerly known as localities (''{{lang|sq|lokalitete}}'').

[[File:Toptani Shopping Mall Tirana 2016.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tirana]] is the economic hub of the country. It is home to major domestic and foreign companies operating in the country.]]

The transition from a socialist [[Planned economy|planned economy]] to a capitalist [[mixed economy]] has been largely successful.&lt;ref name=&quot;worlddiplomacy&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worlddiplomacy.org/Countries/Albania/InfoAlb.html | title=Albania | publisher=World Diplomacy | accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albania has a [[Developing country|developing]] [[mixed economy]] that is classed as a [[List of countries by GNI (nominal, Atlas method) per capita#Upper-middle-income group|upper-middle income economy]] by the [[World Bank]]. With 14.7% in 2016, Albania has the 4th lowest [[List of countries by unemployment rate|unemployment rate]] in the [[Balkans]]. Albania's largest trading partners are Italy, Greece, China, Spain, Kosovo and the United States. The [[Albanian lek|lek]] (ALL) is Albania's currency and is [[Fixed exchange rate|pegged]] at approximately 132,51 lek per euro.

Both, [[Tirana]] and [[Durrës]] are the economic heart of Albania.

Albania's proximity to the [[Ionian Sea]] and the [[Adriatic Sea]] give the underdeveloped fishing industry great potential. The [[World Bank]] and [[European Community]] economists report that, Albania's fishing industry has good potential to generate export earnings because prices in the nearby Greek and Italian markets are many times higher than those in the Albanian market. The fish available off the coasts of Albania are carp, trout, sea bream, mussels, and crustaceans.

The service industry represents the fastest growing sector of the Albanian economy. A significant part of Albania's national income derives from [[tourism]]. In 2016, it directly accounted for 8.4 percent of [[GDP]], though including indirect contributions pushes the proportion to 26 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[World Travel &amp; Tourism Council]]|title=Travel &amp; Tourism: Economic Impact 2017: Albania|url=https://www.wttc.org/…/econo…/countries-2017/albania2017.pdf|website=wttc.org|location=London|page=12|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Albania welcomed around 4.74&amp;nbsp;million visitors, mostly from Southern Europe and several countries from the [[European Union]] and also the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arrivals of foreign citizens by Lëvizjet e shtetasve shqiptarë dhe të huaj and Month|url=http://databaza.instat.gov.al/…/Tr…/table/tableViewLayout2/…|website=databaza.instat.gov.al|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase of foreign visitors has been dramatic.

The bulk of the tourist industry is concentrated along the [[Adriatic]] and [[Ionian Sea]] in the west of the country. However, the [[Albanian Riviera]] in the southwest has the most scenic and pristine beaches, and is often called the pearl of the Albanian coast. Its coastline has a considerable length of {{convert|446|km|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sustainable Development of Sea-Corridors and Coastal Waters: The TEN ECOPORT project in South East Europe|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319113852|page=85|edition=Chrysostomos Stylios, Tania Floqi, Jordan Marinski, Leonardo Damiani|url=https://books.google.de/books…}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coast has a particular character because it is rich in varieties of virgin beaches, capes, coves, covered bays, lagoons, small gravel beaches, sea caves and many landforms.

[[File:Terminal jashte.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza|Tirana International Airport]] is the 10th [[List of the busiest airports in the Balkans|busiest airport]] in the Balkans, handling over 2 million passengers per year.]]

Following the collapse of the [[fall of communism in Albania|communist regime]] in Albania, the transportation has undergone significant changes in the past two decades, vastly modernizing the country's infrastructure. Improvements to the road infrastructure, urban transport, and air travel have all led to a vast improvement in transportation.

Currently there are three main motorways in Albania: the [[A1 motorway (Albania)|A1]], [[A2 motorway (Albania)|A2]], and [[A3 motorway (Albania)|A3]]. The [[A1 motorway (Albania)|A1 motorway]] connects the port city of [[Durrës]] on the [[Adriatic Sea]], to [[Pristina]], the capital of [[Kosovo]]. Prospectively, the motorway will link with [[Pan-European Corridor X]] near [[Niš]] in Serbia. The project was the largest and most expensive infrastructure road project ever undertaken in the country. Two additional highways are currently under construction. The [[A3 motorway (Albania)|A3 motorway]] is going to connect the capital city [[Tirana]] with [[Pan-European corridors|Pan-European Corridor VIII]], linking Albania with [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Bulgaria]] to the east. The North-South motorway consists of [[National Road 1 (Albania)|SH1]] and [[National Road 2 (Albania)|SH2]] and makes up the Albanian portion of the [[Adriatic–Ionian motorway]], a larger regional highway connecting [[Croatia]] with [[Greece]] along the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] and [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]] coasts. When all three corridors are completed, Albania will have an estimated 759&amp;nbsp;kilometers of highway linking it with all of its neighboring countries.

The busiest and largest [[seaport]] in Albania is the [[Port of Durrës]]. {{As of|2014}}, the port ranks as one of the largest passenger ports on the [[Adriatic Sea]], with annual passenger volume of approximately 1.5 million. Other seaports include [[Port of Vlorë|Vlorë]], [[Port of Sarandë|Sarandë]], and [[Port of Shëngjin|Shëngjin]]. The ports serve an extensive system of ferries connecting numerous islands and coastal cities in addition to ferry lines to several cities in Croatia, Greece, and Italy.

[[File:Panorama of Durres Port.jpg|thumb|right|340px|The highly advantageous geographical location of [[Durrës]] makes [[Port of Durrës|its port]] the busiest in Albania and among the largest in the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] and [[Ionian Sea]]s.]]

The only [[international airport]] in the country is the [[Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza]]. It is the only port of entry for air travelers to the country. The airport offers international connections to many [[Europe|European cities]]. In 2016, the [[Government of Albania]] reached an agreement with [[Tirana International Airport]] to end its monopoly on flights, paving the way for the opening of an [[Kukës International Airport Shaikh Zayed|airport]] at [[Kukës]] in the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mejdini|first1=Fatjona|title=Albanians Get to Fly from Second Airport|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/albania-to-open-flights-from-kukesi-airport-04-01-2016|website=Balkan Insight|date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The railways in Albania are administered by the national railway company [[Hekurudha Shqiptare]]. The railway system was extensively promoted by the [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] communist regime of dictator [[Enver Hoxha]], during which time the use of private transport was effectively prohibited. Since the collapse of the communist regime, there has been a considerable increase in car ownership and bus usage. A new railway line from the capital [[Tirana]] via [[Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza|Tirana International Airport]] to the port city [[Durrës]] is currently planned. The location of this railway, connecting the most populated urban areas in Albania, makes it an important economic development project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rabeta|first1=Lorenc|title=Trenat e rinj Tiranë-Durrës-Rinas me 222 pasagjerë, 112 të ulur|url=http://shqiptarja.com/news.php?IDNotizia=396302|website=dailynews.al|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening will take place in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hekurudha Tiranë-Rinas-Durrës, Haxhinasto: Projekti përfundon në 2019|url=http://www.top-channel.tv/lajme/artikull.php?id=329857|website=top-channel.tv|language=Albanian|date=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1990, after the [[Fall of communism in Albania|fall of Communism in Albania]], the country was one of the world's most isolated and controlled countries, and installation and maintenance of a modern system of international and domestic telecommunications was precluded. Callers previously needed operator assistance even to make domestic long-distance calls.
Internet in Albania is fast and inexpensive in comparison to the rest of Europe. For example, an ISP known as ABcom, offers a 30mbit download package for 306.999 lekë ($2.39579 USD) per month.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abcom.al/index.php?action=readmore&amp;cid=4&amp;id=2&amp;gjuha=1&lt;/ref&gt; In the mobile network industry, providers such as [[Vodafone Albania|Vodafone]], [[Telekom Albania|Telekom]], [[Albanian Mobile Communications]] and [[Eagle Mobile]] provide both [[3G]] and [[4G]] data plans. From 1993 human resources in sciences and technology have drastically decreased. Various surveys show that during 1991–2005, approximately 50% of the professors and research scientists of the universities and science institutions in the country have emigrated.&lt;ref name=&quot;dfid&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfid.gov.uk/R4D/SearchResearchDatabase.asp?OutputID=177440|title=Research for Development|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2009 the government approved the &quot;National Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation in Albania&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsdc.gov.al/dsdc/pub/national_strategy_of_science_technology_and_innovation_final_draft_381_1.pdf |title=Strategy of Science, Technology and Innovation 2009–2015 |format=PDF |accessdate=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; covering the period 2009–15. It aims to triple public spending on research and development (R&amp;D) to 0.6% of GDP and augment the share of gross domestic expenditure on R&amp;D from foreign sources, including via the [[European Union]]'s Framework Programmes for Research, to the point where it covers 40% of research spending, among others.

{{Main|Education in Albania}}

[[File:Tirana, palazzo dell%27università 02.JPG|thumb|right|The [[University of Tirana]] is the largest and highest ranking university in the country.]]

Following the [[fall of communism in Albania]] in 1991, a reorganization plan was announced that would extend the compulsory education program from eight to ten years. The following year, major [[Albanian civil war of 1997|economic and political crisis]] in Albania, and the ensuing breakdown of public order, plunged the school system into chaos. Widespread vandalism and extreme shortages of textbooks and supplies had a devastating effect on school operations, prompting Italy and other countries to provide material assistance. In the late 1990, many schools were rebuilt or reconstructed, to improve learning conditions. Most of the improvements have happened in the larger cities of the country especially in [[Tirana]], [[Durrës]] and [[Shkodër]].

All educational programmes in Albania are regulated by the [[Ministry of Education (Albania)|Ministry of Education]] and administered by local municipalities. Education is mostly supported by the state and is composed of three stages, primary education (arsimi fillorë), secondary education (arsimi i mesëm), and tertiary education (arsimi universitarë). The academic year is very similar to the one in the [[United States]], with classes starting in September or October and ending in June or July. [[Albanian language|Albanian]] is the primary language of instruction in all [[state school|public school]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Epnuffic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Albanian education system described and compared with the Dutch system|url=https://www.epnuffic.nl/en/publications/find-a-publication/education-system-albania.pdf|website=epnuffic.nl|language=English|format=PDF|date=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[primary education]] is obligatory from grade one to nine. Students must pass the graduation exams at the end of the 9th grade in order to continue their education. After the primary school, the general education is provided at the [[Secondary education|secondary]] schools. Students get prepared for the [[Matura]] examination, allowing them to obtain their matura diploma, which grants admission to [[higher education]]. Although, Albania follows the [[Bologna model]] in accordance with the 2007 Law on Higher Education. These institutions can be public or private, and may offer one, two or three levels of higher education depending on the institution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Epnuffic&quot;/&gt;

The [[school life expectancy]] of Albania is 16 years, ranking 25th in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCHOOL LIFE EXPECTANCY|url=http://world.bymap.org/SchoolLifeExpectancy.html|website=world.bymap.org|language=English|date=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of countries by literacy rate|Literacy rate]] in Albania is 99.2% for males and 98.3% for females, having an overall of 98.7%.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;/&gt;

According to the [[World Health Organization]], Albania had the world's 55th [[World Health Organization ranking of health systems in 2000|best healthcare performance]] in 2000.

According to the [[Institute of Statistics (Albania)|Institute of Statistics (INSTAT)]] Census of 2011, the total population of Albania was approximately 2,821,977 with a low [[Fertility rate]] of 1.49 children born per woman.&lt;ref&gt;Albania: People, CIA World Factbook, 2012.

The [[Fall of communism in Albania|fall of the Communist regime]] in 1990, Albania was accompanied with massive migration. External migration was prohibited outright in Communist Albania while internal migration was quite limited, hence this was a new phenomenon. Between 1991 and 2004, roughly 900,000 people have migrated out of Albania, about 600,000 of them settling in [[Albanians in greece|Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=239 Albania: Looking Beyond Borders]&quot;. Migration Policy Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Migration greatly affected Albania's internal population distribution. Population decreased mainly in the North and South of the country while it increased in [[Tirana]] and [[Durrës]] center districts.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} According to the [[Institute of Statistics (Albania)|Institute of Statistics (INSTAT)]] as of 1 January 2015, the population of Albania is 2,893,005.&lt;ref name=&quot;Statistics&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Republic of Albania Institute of Statistics |title=Population of Albania 1 January 2016 |url=http://www.instat.gov.al/al/themes/popullsia/publications/books/2016/popullsia-e-shqipërisë,-1-janar-2016.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues of ethnicity are a delicate topic and subject to debate. Contrary to official statistics that show an over 97 per cent Albanian majority in the country, minority groups (such as [[Greeks in Albania|Greeks]], [[Macedonians in Albania|Macedonians]], [[Montenegrins in Albania|Montenegrins]], [[Roma in Albania|Roma]] and [[Aromanians in Albania|Aromanians]]) have frequently disputed the official numbers, asserting a higher percentage of the country's population. According to the disputed 2011 census, ethnic affiliation was as follows: [[Albanians]] 2,312,356 (82.6% of the total), [[Greeks in Albania|Greeks]] 24,243 (0.9%), [[Macedonians of Albania|Macedonians]] 5,512 (0.2%), [[Montenegrins of Albania|Montenegrins]] 366 (0.01%), [[Aromanians]] 8,266 (0.30%), [[Romani people|Romani]] 8,301 (0.3%), [[Balkan Egyptians]] 3,368 (0.1%), other ethnicities 2,644 (0.1%), no declared ethnicity 390,938 (14.0%), and not relevant 44,144 (1.6%).&lt;ref name=&quot;Population and Housing Census 2011&quot;/&gt; On the quality of the specific data the Advisory Committee on the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]] stated that &quot;the results of the census should be viewed with the utmost caution and calls on the authorities not to rely exclusively on the data on nationality collected during the census in determining its policy on the protection of national minorities.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Third Opinion on Albania adopted on 23 November 2011|url=https://rm.coe.int/168008c633|publisher= Advisory Committee on the Framework for the Protection of National Minorities|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albania recognizes almost three national minorities, [[Greeks]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] and [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], and two cultural minorities: [[Aromanians]] and [[Romani people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,COUNTRYPROF,ALB,,4954cdfe1a,0.html |title=World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples&amp;nbsp;– Albania : Overview |publisher=Unhcr.org |date=11 May 2005 |accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Albanian minorities are [[Bulgarians]], [[Gorani people|Gorani]], [[Serbs]], [[Egyptians (Balkans)|Balkan Egyptians]], [[Bosniaks]] and [[Jew]]s.

Macedonian and some Greek minority groups have sharply criticized Article 20 of the Census law, according to which a $1,000 fine will be imposed on anyone who will declare an ethnicity other than what is stated on his or her birth certificate.

[[Albanian language|Albanian]] is the official language of the Republic of Albania. Its standard spoken and written form is revised and merged from the two main dialects, [[Gheg]] and [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]], though it is notably based more on the Tosk dialect. The [[Shkumbin]] river is the rough dividing line between the two dialects. Also a [[Greeks in Albania#Language|dialect of Greek]] that preserves features now lost in standard [[modern Greek]] is spoken in areas inhabited by the [[Greek minority in Albania|Greek minority]]. Other languages spoken by ethnic minorities in Albania include [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Gora dialect|Gorani]], and [[Romani language|Roma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=albania |title=Languages of Albania |accessdate=31 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123044546/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=Albania |archivedate=23 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonian is official in the Pustec Municipality in East Albania.

Albania is one of the most ancient countries of [[Christianity in Albania|Christianity]]. There are thought to have been about seventy Christian families in the port town of [[Durrës]] as early as the time of the Apostles. The Archbishopric of Durrës was purportedly founded by the apostle Paul while preaching in Illyria and Epirus.[http://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/10-3_242.pdf]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reformation.edu/albania/pages/early-christianity-albania.htm|title=Early Christianity – Albania – Reformation Christian Ministries – Albania  &amp; Kosovo|author=|date=|work=reformation.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Albanians first appeared in the historical record in [[Byzantine]] sources of the late 11th century. At this point, they were already fully Christianized. [[Islam]] came for the first time in the 9th century to the region which is known as Albania today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Jørgen Nielsen |author2=Samim Akgönül |author3=Ahmet Alibašić |author4=Egdunas Racius |title=Yearbook of Muslims in Europe|chapter=Albania|page=23|volume=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ia5AAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA351&amp;lpg=PA351&amp;dq=yearbook+islam+europa+albania&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NfP5NcIwYX&amp;sig=VvUvHqlH8VrkDQyN-CUgs0UweoA&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFgv7GkbzLAhWCBSwKHXbmABAQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=albania&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 March 2016|publisher=Brill|year=2013|location=Leiden, Boston, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later emerged as the majority religion during the centuries of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, though a significant Christian minority remained. After independence (1912) from the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later Communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom. In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy, and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s, under the state policy of obliterating all organized religion from Albanian territories.

The Communist regime that took control of Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely [[anti-religious|banned religion]] to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first [[atheist state]]. Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992. Albania joined the [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] in 1992, following the fall of the communist government, but did not attend the 2014 conference due a dispute regarding the fact that its parliament never ratified the country's membership.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mejdini&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gazeta-shqip.com/lajme/2014/02/17/shqiperia-refuzon-organizaten-islamike-jo-pjese-e-aktivitetit-ne-teheran/|title=Shqipëria refuzon Organizatën Islamike, jo pjesë e aktivitetit në Teheran|last=Mejdini|first=Fatjona|date=17 February 2014|publisher=Shqip|language=Albanian|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albanian Muslim populations (mainly secular and of the [[Sunni]] branch) are found throughout the country whereas [[Albanian Orthodox Church|Albanian Orthodox Christians]] as well as [[Bektashi]]s are concentrated in the south and Roman Catholics are found in the north of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;International Religious Freedom Report 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90160.htm |title=Albania: International Religious Freedom Report 2007 |publisher=State.gov |date=14 September 2007 |accessdate=27 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828091818/http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90160.htm |archivedate=28 August 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded Albanian Protestant was Said Toptani, who traveled around Europe, and in 1853 returned to Tirana and preached Protestantism. He was arrested and imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities in 1864. Mainline evangelical Protestants date back to the work of Congregational and later Methodist missionaries and the work of the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] in the 19th century. The Evangelical Alliance, which is known as VUSh, was founded in 1892. Today VUSh has about 160 member congregations from different Protestant denominations. VUSh organizes marches in Tirana including one against blood feuds in 2010. Bibles are provided by the Interconfessional Bible Society of Albania. The first full Albanian Bible to be printed was the Filipaj translation printed in 1990.

Due to its long history, Albania is home to many valuable cultural and historical landmarks. From antiquity to the modern period, major cities in the country have evolved from within the castle to include dwellings, religious, and commercial structures, with constant redesigning of town squares and evolution of building techniques.

Albania is host to three [[UNESCO]] [[List of World Heritage Sites in Albania|World Heritage Sites]], including the ancient remains of [[Butrint]] in the south of [[Sarandë]], the medieval [[Historic Centres of Berat and Gjirokastër]], and [[Gashi River]] and [[Rrajcë]], which is part of the [[Shebenik-Jabllanice National Park]] under the [[Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[UNESCO]]|title=Butrint|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/570|website=whc.unesco.org|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[UNESCO]]|title=Historic Centres of Berat and Gjirokastra|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/569|website=whc.unesco.org|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[UNESCO]]|title=Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1133|website=whc.unesco.org|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the [[Natural and Cultural Heritage of the Ohrid Region (Albania)|natural and cultural heritage]] of Ohrid, the royal [[Royal Tombs of Selca e Poshtme|Illyrian tombs]] of Selca e Poshtme, the remains of [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]], the ancient [[Durrës Amphitheatre|Amphitheatre]] of [[Durrës]] and the [[Fortress of Bashtovë]] has been included on the tentative list.

Many ancient architectural treasures from the [[Illyrians]] such as [[Byllis]], [[Amantia]], [[Phoenice]] and [[Rozafa Castle|Shkodër]] can be found in Albania. Due to the long period of rule of the [[Byzantine Empire]], Albania is home to many Byzantine churches, castles, and monasteries. Albania also host many surviving monuments from the five centuries of Ottoman rule. In the 19th century, Albanian medieval towns underwent urban transformations by Austro-Hungarian and Italian architects, giving them the appearance of European cities. During the [[Peoples Republic of Albania|communism]], many socialist-styled complexes, wide roads, and factories were constructed, while town squares were redesigned and a number of historic buildings demolished.

{{Main|Music of Albania|Traditional Albanian clothing|l1=Music|l2=Traditional clothing of Albania}}

[[File:Les Danseurs Albanais by Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps (c. 1835).jpg|thumb|right|The ''Albanian dancers'' by [[Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps|Alexandre Decamps]] wearing [[Fustanella]]s, the national costume of Albania.]]

The [[Albanian music|folk music]] of Albania falls into two major groups, such as the northern [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]]s and southern [[Labëria|Lab]]s and [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]]s. The northern and southern traditions are contrasted by the rugged and heroic tone of the north and the relaxed form of the south. The [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]]s are known for a distinctive variety of sung epic poetry. Many of the songs are about the ancient history of the [[Albanians]] but also the national hero [[Skanderbeg]], who led the struggle against the Ottomans, and the constant Albanian themes of honour, hospitality, treachery and revenge. [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]] music is soft and gentle, and [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] in nature. The southern corner of Albania is also known for funeral laments with a chorus and one to two soloists with overlapping, mournful voices. Its instrumental music includes the sedate kaba, an ensemble-driven by a [[clarinet]] or [[violin]] alongside accordions and [[lahuta]]. The kaba is an improvised and melancholic style with melodies that Kim Burton describes as &quot;both fresh and ancient&quot;, &quot;ornamented with swoops, glides and growls of an almost vocal quality&quot;, exemplifying the &quot;combination of passion with restraint that is the hallmark of Albanian culture&quot;.

[[File:Lahuta.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A northern [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]] Albanian wearing the triq as he carries the [[lahuta]]]]

These disparate styles are unified by the intensity that both performers and listeners give to their music as a medium for patriotic expression and as a vehicle carrying the narrative of [[oral history]], as well as certain characteristics like the use of rhythms such as 3/8, 5/8 and 10/8.&lt;ref&gt;Arbatsky, Yuri, cited in Koco with the footnote ''Translated and published by Filip Fishta in Shkolla Kombëtare (The National School; No.1, May 1939), 19, and quoted from his Preface to [[Pjetër Dungu]]'s Lyra Shqiptare (see note 2).''&lt;/ref&gt; The first compilation of Albanian folk music was made by two [[Himara|Himariot]] song artists [[Neço Muko|Neço Muka]] and Koço Çakali in 1929 and 1931 in [[Paris]] during their interpretations with the Albanian song diva Tefta Tashko Koço. Several gramophone compilations were recorded in those years by this genial trio of Albanian artists which eventually led to the recognition of the Himariot Isopolyphonic Music as an [[List of World Heritage Sites in Albania|UNESCO World Heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shekulli.com.al/m/post.php?id=362126#sthash.CGPYx8MA.dpbs|title=Kujtimet për Koço Çakalin, themeluesin e këngës himariote|publisher=|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some conservative old men and women mainly from the high Northern as well as Southern Lands and wear traditional clothing in their daily lives. The clothing was made mainly of products from the local agriculture and livestock such as leather, wool, linen, hemp fiber and silk. Today, the Albanian traditional textiles are still embroidered in very claborate ancient patterns. Among the most important parts of clothing includes the [[Qeleshe|Plis]], [[Albanian hat]], Qylafë, [[Fustanella]], [[Xhubleta]], [[Xhamadan]], [[Brez (clothing)|Brez]], [[Çorape]], [[Opinga]] and others.

The language is considered an [[Language isolate|isolate]] within the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]. The only other languages that are the sole surviving member of a branch of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] are Armenian and Greek.

(Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see [[Thraco-Illyrian]].)

The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the [[Albanian language]] in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the northern of Albania, but also of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] in the south. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition, when cleric [[Gjon Buzuku]] brought into the Albanian language the [[Catholic liturgy]], trying to do for the Albanian language, what [[Martin Luther]] did for the [[German language]]. [[Meshari]] (''The Missal'') written by [[Gjon Buzuku]] was published in 1555 and is considered as one of the first literary work of written Albanian during the Middle Ages. The refined level of the language and the stabilised orthography must be the result of an earlier tradition of written Albanian, a tradition that is not well understood. However, there is some fragmented evidence, pre-dating Buzuku, which indicates that Albanian was written from at least the 14th century.
The earliest evidence dates from 1332&amp;nbsp;AD with a Latin report from the French Dominican Guillelmus Adae, [[Archbishop]] of [[Antivari]], who wrote that Albanians used Latin letters in their books although their language was quite different from Latin. Other significant examples include: a [[Formula e pagëzimit|baptism formula]] (''Unte paghesont premenit Atit et Birit et spertit senit'') from 1462, written in Albanian within a Latin text by the Bishop of [[Durrës]], [[Pal Engjëlli]]; a glossary of Albanian words of 1497 by Arnold von Harff, a German who had travelled through Albania, and a 15th-century fragment of the Bible from the [[Gospel of Matthew]], also in Albanian, but written in Greek letters.

Albanian writings from these centuries must not have been religious texts only, but historical chronicles too. They are mentioned by the humanist [[Marin Barleti]], who in his book [[Siege of Shkodra (1478)#The Book|Siege of Shkodër]] (''Rrethimi i Shkodrës'') from 1504, confirms that he leafed through such chronicles written in the language of the people (''in vernacula lingua'') as well as his famous biography of [[Skanderbeg]] [[Marin Barleti|Historia de vita et gestis Scanderbegi Epirotarum principis]] (''History of Skanderbeg'') from 1508. The ''History of Skanderbeg'' is still the foundation of Skanderbeg studies and is considered an Albanian cultural treasure, vital to the formation of Albanian national self-consciousness.

During the 16th and the 17th centuries, the [[catechism]] (''E mbësuame krishterë'') (Christian Teachings) from 1592 written by [[Lekë Matrënga]], (''Doktrina e krishterë'') (The Christian Doctrine) from 1618 and (''Rituale romanum'') 1621 by [[Pjetër Budi]], the first writer of original Albanian [[prose]] and poetry, an [[Remorse|apology]] for George Castriot (1636) by [[Frang Bardhi]], who also published a dictionary and [[folklore]] creations, the theological-philosophical treaty ''[[Cuneus Prophetarum]]'' (The Band of Prophets) (1685) by [[Pjetër Bogdani]], the most universal personality of Albanian [[Middle Ages]], were published in [[Albanian language|Albanian]]. The most famous Albanian writer in the 20th and 21th century is probably [[Ismail Kadare]]. He has been mentioned as a possible recipient of the [[Nobel Prize]] in Literature several times.

The [[visual art]]s tradition of Albania has been shaped by the many cultures, which have flourished on its territory. Once the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]s, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s ruled over Albania for nearly five centuries, which greatly affected the country's artwork and artistic forms. After Albania's joining with the Ottoman Empire in 1478, Ottoman influenced art forms such as mosaics and mural paintings became prevalent, and no real artistic change occurred until the [[Albanian Declaration of Independence|independence]] in 1912.

Following mosaics and murals from antiquity and the middle mges, the first paintings were icons Byzantine Orthodox tradition. Albanian earliest icons date from the late thirteenth century and generally estimated that their artistic peak reached in the eighteenth century. Among the most prominent representatives of the Albanian iconographic art were [[Onufri]] and [[David Selenica]]. The museums of [[Berat]], [[Korçë]] and [[Tirana]] houses good collections remaining icons. By the end of the Ottoman period, the painting was limited mostly to folk art and ornate mosques.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.albanianart.net index_al&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Robert Elsie: Arti Shqiptar|url = http://www.albanianart.net/index_al.html|website = www.albanianart.net|accessdate = 22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paintings and sculpture arose in the first half of the twentieth century and reached a modest peak in the 1930s and 1940s, when the first organized art exhibitions at national level.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.albanianart.net index_al&quot;/&gt; Contemporary Albanian artwork captures the struggle of everyday Albanians, however new artists are utilizing different artistic styles to convey this message. Albanian artists continue to move art forward, while their art still remains distinctively Albanian in content. Though among Albanian artist post-modernism was fairly recently introduced, there is a number of artists and works known internationally. Among the most prominent Albanian post-modernist are considered [[Anri Sala]], [[Sislej Xhafa]], and [[Helidon Gjergji]].

The Cuisine of Albania&amp;nbsp;– as with most [[Mediterranean]] and [[Balkans|Balkan]] nations&amp;nbsp;– is strongly influenced by its long history. At different times, the territory which is now Albania has been claimed or occupied by [[Ancient Greece]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], Byzantine and the [[Ottoman Turk]]s and each group has left its mark on Albanian cuisine.

The main meal of [[Albanians]] is the midday meal, which is usually accompanied by a [[salad]] of fresh vegetables such as tomatoes, [[cucumber]]s, green [[bell pepper|peppers]] and [[olive]]s with [[olive oil]], vinegar and salt. It also includes a main dish of vegetables and meat. Though it is used in several dishes, pumpkins are more commonly displayed and traditionally given as gifts throughout Albania, especially in the region of Berat. Seafood specialties are also common in the coastal cities of [[Durrës]], [[Sarandë]] and [[Vlorë]]. In high elevation localities, smoked meat and pickled preserves are common.

The history of [[Cinema of Albania|Cinema in Albania]] dates back to 1911 and 1912 with the first showings of foreign films and few documentaries in the pre-war and inter-war period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aqshf.gov.al/ Albania National Film Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; The first public showing to occur in Albania was a little-known title, ''Paddy the Reliable'', a comical story. The publication of foreign films began in the cities of [[Shkodër]] and [[Korçë]].

The first Albanian films were mostly [[documentaries]]; the first was about the [[Monastir Congress]] that sanctioned the [[Albanian alphabet]] in 1908. During communism, the Albanian Film Institute that later became known as [[Kinostudio Shqipëria e Re]] was founded with Soviet assistance, focusing mostly on propaganda of wartime struggles.

After 1945, the [[communist state|communist government]] founded the [[Albanian National Center of Cinematography|Kinostudio Shqipëria e Re]] in 1952. This was followed by the first Albanian [[epic film]], ''[[The Great Warrior Skanderbeg|Skënderbeu]]'', a cooperation with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] artists chronicling the life and fight of the Albanian national hero [[Gjergj Kastriot Skanderbeg|Skanderbeg]]. The film was awarded from the [[Cannes Film Festival]].

Notable [[List of Albanian film directors|Albanian film directors]] include [[Andamion Murataj]], [[Besim Sahatçiu]], [[Xhanfize Keko]], [[Dhimitër Anagnosti]], [[Kujtim Çashku]], [[Luljeta Hoxha]], [[Saim Kokona]], [[Saimir Kumbaro]], [[Kristaq Mitro]], [[Leon Qafzezi]] and [[Gjergj Xhuvani]]. Famous actors in Albania include [[Nik Xhelilaj]], [[Klement Tinaj]], [[Masiela Lusha]], [[Blerim Destani]], [[Aleksandër Moisiu]], [[Tinka Kurti]], [[Pjetër Malota]], [[Sandër Prosi]] and [[Margarita Xhepa]].

By 1990, about 200 movies had been produced, and Albania had over 450 theaters. With the economic transition after the collapse of communism in the 1990s, the Kinostudio was broken up and privatised. A new [[Albanian National Center of Cinematography|National Center of Cinematography]] was established, while cities built modern cinema theatres showing mostly American movies.

The [[Tirana International Film Festival]] was established in 2003 and has become the premier and largest film festival in the country as well as in the Balkans. [[Durrës]] hosts the [[International Film Summerfest of Durrës]], the second largest international film festival in the country which takes place every year in late August or early September in [[Durrës Amphitheatre]].

There are internationally renowned actors in the Albanian diaspora, such as the [[Albanian Americans|Albanian-Americans]] [[Eliza Dushku]], [[Jim Belushi|Jim]] and [[John Belushi]], [[Kosovo Albanians|Kosovo-Albanians]] [[Bekim Fehmiu]] and [[Arta Dobroshi]] and [[Albanians in Turkey|Turkish-Albanian]] [[Barish Arduch|Barish Arduç]].
