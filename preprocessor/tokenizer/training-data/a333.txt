'''Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis''' ('''ADEM'''), or '''acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis''', is a rare [[autoimmune]] disease marked by a sudden, widespread attack of inflammation in the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]]. As well as causing the brain and spinal cord to become inflamed, ADEM also attacks the nerves of the central nervous system and damages their myelin insulation, which, as a result, destroys the [[white matter]]. It is often triggered after the patient has received a [[virus (biology)|viral]] [[infection]] or, perhaps exceedingly rarely specific non-routine [[vaccinations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Dale RC |title=Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis |journal=Semin Pediatr Infect Dis |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=90–5 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12881796 |doi=10.1053/spid.2003.127225 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Garg RK |title=Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis |journal=Postgrad Med J |volume=79 |issue=927 |pages=11–7 |date=January 2003 |pmid=12566545 |doi= 10.1136/pmj.79.927.11|url=http://pmj.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12566545 |pmc=1742586}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Jones CT |title=Childhood autoimmune neurologic diseases of the central nervous system |journal=Neurol Clin |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=745–64 |date=November 2003 |pmid=14743647 |doi= 10.1016/S0733-8619(03)00007-0|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Huynh W, Cordato DJ, Kehdi E, Masters LT, Dedousis C |title=Post-vaccination encephalomyelitis: literature review and illustrative case |journal=J Clin Neurosci |volume=15 |issue=12 |pages=:1315–1322 |date=Dec 2008 |pmid=18976924 |doi=10.1016/j.jocn.2008.05.002 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Rust RS |title=Multiple sclerosis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and related conditions |journal=Semin Pediatr Neurol |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=66–90 |date=June 2000 |pmid=10914409 |doi= 10.1053/pb.2000.6693|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Poser and Brinar 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Poser CM, Brinar VV |title=Disseminated encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis: two different diseases - a critical review |journal=Acta Neurol.

ADEM's symptoms resemble the symptoms of [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS), so the disease itself is sorted into the classification of the [[multiple sclerosis borderline]] diseases. However, ADEM has several features that distinguish it from MS.&lt;ref&gt;Lauren B. Krupp et al.

ADEM consists of a single flare-up whereas MS is marked with several flare-ups (or relapses), over a long period of time. Relapses following ADEM are reported in up to a quarter of patients, but the majority of these 'multiphasic' presentations following ADEM likely represent MS.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koelman|first=Diederik L.

ADEM produces multiple [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] [[lesion]]s in the brain and [[spinal cord]], particularly in the [[white matter]].

==Signs and symptoms==
ADEM has an abrupt onset and a monophasic course. Symptoms usually begin 1–3 weeks after infection. Major symptoms include [[fever]], [[headache]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[confusion]], [[Blindness|vision impairment]], drowsiness, [[non-epileptic seizure|seizure]]s and [[coma]]. Although initially the symptoms are usually mild, they worsen rapidly over the course of hours to days, with the average time to maximum severity being about four and a half days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tenembaum et al. 2002&quot; /&gt; Additional symptoms include hemiparesis, paraparesis, and cranial nerve palsies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Allmendinger A, Krauthamer A, Spektor V | year = 2009 | title = Case of the month | url = http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/case-studies/content/article/113619/1493546 | journal = Diagnostic Imaging | volume = 31 | issue = 12| page = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
A preceding antigenic challenge can be identified in approximately two-thirds of people.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Viral infections thought to induce ADEM include [[Orthomyxoviridae|influenza virus]], [[enterovirus]], [[measles]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher |first=DL |last2=Defres |first2=S |last3=Solomon |first3=T|title=Measles-induced encephalitis|journal=QJM|year=2015|volume=108|issue=3 |pmid=24865261|doi=10.1093/qjmed/hcu113 |pages=177–182|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mumps]], [[rubella]], [[varicella zoster]], [[Epstein Barr virus]], [[cytomegalovirus]], [[herpes simplex virus]], [[hepatitis A]], and [[coxsackievirus]]; while the bacterial infections include [[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]], [[Borrelia burgdorferi]], [[Leptospira]], and [[Streptococcus#Beta-Hemolytic Streptococci|beta-hemolytic Streptococci]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tenembaum et al. 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Tenembaum S, Chitnis T, Ness J, Hahn JS |title=Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis |journal=Neurology |volume=68 |issue=16 Suppl 2 |pages=S23–36 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17438235 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000259404.51352.7f |url=|others=International Pediatric MS Study Group }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only vaccine proven to induce ADEM is the Semple form of the [[rabies]] vaccine, but [[hepatitis B]], [[pertussis]], [[diphtheria]], measles, mumps, rubella, [[pneumococcus]], [[varicella]], influenza, [[Japanese encephalitis]], and [[polio]] vaccines have all been implicated.

==Diagnosis==

Currently, the commonly accepted international standard for the [[clinical case definition]] is the one published by the [[International Pediatric MS Study Group]], revision 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tenembaum S, Chitnis T, Ness J, Hahn JS | year = 2007 | title = Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis | url = | journal = Neurology | volume = 68 | issue = 16 suppl 2 | pages = S23–S36 | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000259404.51352.7f | pmid=17438235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
No controlled clinical trials have been conducted on ADEM treatment, but aggressive treatment aimed at rapidly reducing inflammation of the CNS is standard. The widely accepted [[first-line treatment]] is high doses of intravenous [[corticosteroid]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Shahar et al. 2002&quot; /&gt; such as [[methylprednisolone]] or [[dexamethasone]], followed by 3–6 weeks of gradually lower oral doses of [[prednisolone]]. Patients treated with methylprednisolone have shown better outcomes than those treated with dexamethasone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tenembaum et al. 2002&quot; /&gt; Oral tapers of less than three weeks duration show a higher chance of relapsing,&lt;ref name=&quot;Anlar B, Basaran C, Kose G, et al. 2003 194–9&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dale RC, de Sousa C, Chong WK, Cox TC, Harding B, Neville BG 2000 2407–22&quot; /&gt; and tend to show poorer outcomes.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} Other anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies have been reported to show beneficial effect, such as [[plasmapheresis]], high doses of intravenous [[immunoglobulin]] (IVIg),&lt;ref name=&quot;Shahar et al. 2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shahar E, Andraus J, Savitzki D, Pilar G, Zelnik N |title=Outcome of severe encephalomyelitis in children: effect of high-dose methylprednisolone and immunoglobulins |journal=J.

In a study of 16 children with ADEM, 10 recovered completely after high-dose methylprednisolone, one severe case that failed to respond to steroids recovered completely after IV Ig; the five most severe cases -with ADAM and severe [[peripheral neuropathy]]- were treated with combined high-dose methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin, two remained paraplegic, one had motor and cognitive handicaps, and two recovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shahar et al. 2002&quot; /&gt; A recent review of IVIg treatment of ADEM (of which the previous study formed the bulk of the cases) found that 70% of children showed complete recovery after treatment with IVIg, or IVIg plus corticosteroids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Feasby T, Banwell B, Benstead T |title=Guidelines on the use of intravenous immune globulin for neurologic conditions |journal=Transfus Med Rev |volume=21 |issue=2 Suppl 1 |pages=S57–107 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17397768 |doi=10.1016/j.tmrv.2007.01.002 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of IVIg treatment in adults with ADEM showed that IVIg seems more effective in treating sensory and motor disturbances, while steroids seem more effective in treating impairments of cognition, consciousness and rigor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ravaglia S, Piccolo G, Ceroni M, et al. 2007 1518–23&quot; /&gt; This same study found one subject, a 71-year-old man who had not responded to steroids, that responded to an IVIg treatment 58 days after disease onset.

==Prognosis==
Full recovery is seen in  50 to 70% of cases, ranging to 70 to 90% recovery with some minor residual disability (typically assessed using measures such as [[Modified Rankin Scale|mRS]] or [[Expanded Disability Status Scale|EDSS]]), average time to recover is one to six months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Menge et al. 2007&quot; /&gt; The mortality rate may be as high as 5%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Menge et al. 2007&quot; /&gt; Poorer outcomes are associated with unresponsiveness to steroid therapy, unusually severe neurological symptoms, or sudden onset. Children tend to have more favorable outcomes than adults, and cases presenting without fevers tend to have poorer outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lin CH, Jeng JS, Hsieh ST, Yip PK, Wu RM |title=Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis: a follow-up study in Taiwan |journal=J.

===Motor deficits===
Residual motor deficits are estimated to remain in about 8 to 30% of cases, the range in severity from mild clumsiness to [[ataxia]] and [[hemiparesis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tenembaum et al. 2007&quot; /&gt;

===Neurocognitive===
Patients with demyelinating illnesses, such as MS, have shown cognitive deficits even when there is minimal physical disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Foong J, Rozewicz L, Quaghebeur G |title=Executive function in multiple sclerosis. The role of frontal lobe pathology |journal=Brain |volume=120 |issue= 1|pages=15–26 |date=January 1997 |pmid=9055794 |doi= 10.1093/brain/120.1.15|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9055794|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that similar effects are seen after ADEM, but that the deficits are less severe than those seen in MS. A study of six children with ADEM (mean age at presentation 7.7 years) were tested for a range of neurocognitive tests after an average of 3.5 years of recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hahn CD, Miles BS, MacGregor DL, Blaser SI, Banwell BL, Hetherington CR |title=Neurocognitive outcome after acute disseminated encephalomyelitis |journal=Pediatr.

Group means for each cognitive domain were all within one standard deviation of age norms, demonstrating that, as a group, they were normal. These deficits were less severe than those seen in similar aged children with a diagnosis of MS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Banwell BL, Anderson PE |title=The cognitive burden of multiple sclerosis in children |journal=Neurology |volume=64 |issue=5 |pages=891–4 |date=March 2005 |pmid=15753431 |doi=10.1212/01.WNL.0000152896.35341.51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study compared nineteen children with a history of ADEM, of which 10 were five years of age or younger at the time (average age 3.8 years old, tested an average of 3.9 years later) and nine were older (mean age 7.7y at time of ADEM, tested an average of 2.2 years later) to nineteen matched controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jacobs RK, Anderson VA, Neale JL, Shield LK, Kornberg AJ |title=Neuropsychological outcome after acute disseminated encephalomyelitis: impact of age at illness onset |journal=Pediatr.

Again, all groups means were within one standard deviation of the controls, meaning that while effects were statistically reliable, the children were as a whole, still within the normal range. There were also more behavioural problems in the early onset group, although there is some suggestion that this may be due, at least in part, to the stress of hospitalization at a young age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Douglas JW |title=Early hospital admissions and later disturbances of behaviour and learning |journal=Dev Med Child Neurol |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=456–80 |date=August 1975 |pmid=1158052 |doi= 10.1111/j.1469-8749.1975.tb03497.x|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Daviss WB, Racusin R, Fleischer A, Mooney D, Ford JD, McHugo GJ |title=Acute stress disorder symptomatology during hospitalization for pediatric injury |journal=J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=569–75 |date=May 2000 |pmid=10802974 |doi= 10.1097/00004583-200005000-00010|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0890-8567&amp;volume=39&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multiple sclerosis==
While ADEM and MS both involve autoimmune demyelination, they differ in many clinical, genetic, imaging, and histopathological aspects.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wingerchuk DM, Lucchinetti CF |title=Comparative immunopathogenesis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, neuromyelitis optica, and multiple sclerosis |journal=Curr.

Typically, ADEM appears in children following an antigenic challenge and remains monophasic. Nevertheless, ADEM does occur in adults,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; and can also be clinically multiphasic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Krupp LB, Banwell B, Tenembaum S, ((International Pediatric MS Study Group)) | year = 2007 | title = Consensus definitions proposed for pediatric multiple sclerosis and related disorders | url = | journal = Neurology | volume = 68 | issue = Suppl 2| pages = S7–S12 |pmid=17438241 | doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000259422.44235.a8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems for differential diagnosis increase due to the lack of agreement for a definition of multiple sclerosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20129937&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lassmann H | year = | title = Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 133 | issue = Pt 2| pages = 317–319 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awp342 | pmid=20129937 | date=Feb 2010| doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt; If MS were defined just by the separation in time and space of the demyelinating lesions as McDonald did,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11456302&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McDonald WI, Compston A, Edan G |title=Recommended diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis: guidelines from the International Panel on the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis|url=|journal=[[Ann.

Therefore, some authors propose to establish the separation line in the shape of the lesions around the veins, being therefore &quot;perivenous vs. confluent demyelination&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20129937&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Young&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Young NP, etal | year = 2010 | title = Perivenous demyelination: association with clinically defined acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and comparison with pathologically confirmed multiple sclerosis | url = http://www.medscape.com/medline/abstract/20129932 | journal = Brain | volume = 133 | issue = 2| pages = 333–48 | doi=10.1093/brain/awp321| doi-access = free | pmid=20129932 | pmc=2822631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pathology of ADEM is very similar to that of MS with some differences. The pathological hallmark of ADEM is perivenular inflammation with limited &quot;sleeves of demyelination&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Young NP | date = Feb 2008 | title = Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis: Current Understanding and Controversies.

Plaques in the white matter in MS are sharply delineated, while the [[glial scar]] in ADEM is smooth. Axons are better preserved in ADEM lesions. Inflammation in ADEM is widely disseminated and ill-defined, and finally, lesions are strictly perivenous, while in MS they are disposed around veins, but not so sharply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lu Z, Zhang B, Qiu W, Kang Z, Shen L | year = 2011 | title = Comparative Brain Stem Lesions on MRI of Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis, Neuromyelitis Optica, and Multiple Sclerosis | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 8| page = e22766 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0022766 |display-authors=etal| doi-access = free | pmid=21853047 | pmc=3154259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the co-occurrence of perivenous and confluent demyelination in some individuals suggests pathogenic overlap between acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis and misclassification even with biopsy&lt;ref name=&quot;Young&quot; /&gt; or even postmortem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Guenther AD, Munoz DG | year = 2013 | title = Plaque-like demyelination in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - an autopsy case report | url = | journal = Clinical Neuropathology | volume = 32 | issue = 6| pages = 486–491 | doi = 10.5414/NP300634 | pmid = 23863345 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Treatment of ADEM and [[Neuromyelitis optica]] with long-term immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive drugs --&gt; ADEM in adults can progress to MS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwarz S, Mohr A, Knauth M, Wildemann B, Storch-Hagenlocher B | year = 2001 | title = Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis: A follow-up study of 40 adult patients | doi = 10.1212/WNL.56.10.1313 | journal = Neurology | volume = 56 | issue = 10| pages = 1313–1318 | pmid=11376180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis==

When the patient suffers more than one demyelinating episode of ADEM, the disease is then called '''recurrent disseminated encephalomyelitis''' or '''multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis'''&lt;ref name=&quot;Dale RC, de Sousa C, Chong WK, Cox TC, Harding B, Neville BG 2000 2407–22&quot; /&gt; (MDEM).

It has been found that anti-[[Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein|MOG]] auto-antibodies are related to this kind of ADEM&lt;ref&gt;M. Baumann, E.M. Hennes, K. Schanda, M. Karenfort, B.

Another variant of ADEM in adults has been described, also related to anti-MOG auto-antibodies, has been named '''fulminant disseminated encephalomyelitis''', and it has been reported to be clinically ADEM, but showing MS-like lesions on autopsy.&lt;ref name=&quot;DiPauli&quot;/&gt; It has been classified inside the [[anti-MOG associated inflammatory demyelinating diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Baumann M |display-authors=etal | year = 2016 | title = Children with multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis and antibodies to the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG): Extending the spectrum of MOG antibody positive diseases | url = | journal = Mult Scler | volume =  | issue = | page =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis==

Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHL, or AHLE), also known as acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE), acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis (AHEM), acute necrotizing hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (ANHLE), Weston-Hurst syndrome, or Hurst's disease, is a hyperacute and frequently fatal form of ADEM.
