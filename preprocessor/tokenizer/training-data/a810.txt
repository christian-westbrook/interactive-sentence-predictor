{{wiktionary|Alphons|Alfonso}}

'''Alphons''' (Latinized ''Alphonsus, Adelphonsus, Adefonsus'') is a male given name recorded from the 8th century ([[Alfonso I of Asturias]], r. 739-757) in the Christian successor states of the [[Visigothic kingdom]] in the [[Iberian peninsula]]. In the later medieval period it became a standard name in the [[Monarchy of Spain|Hispanic]] and [[kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] royal families.

It is derived from a [[Gothic name]], or a conflation of several Gothic names; from ''*Aþalfuns'', composed of the elements ''[[aþal]]'' &quot;noble&quot; and ''funs'' &quot;eager, brave, ready&quot;, and perhaps influenced by names such as ''*Alafuns'', ''*Adefuns'' and ''*[[Ildefonsus|Hildefuns]]''.
It is recorded as ''Adefonsus'' in the 9th and 10th century,&lt;ref&gt;in the genitive, ''Adefonsi'':&lt;/ref&gt;
and as ''Adelfonsus'', ''Adelphonsus'' in the 10th to 11th. The reduced form ''Alfonso'' is recorded in the late 9th century, and the Portuguese form ''Afonso'' from the early 11th.&lt;ref&gt;José Pedro Machado, ''Dicionário Onomástico Etimológico da Língua Portuguesa''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;E. Förstemann, ''Altdeutsches Namenbuch'' (1856:133, 145).&lt;/ref&gt;

Variants of the name include: ''Alfonso'' (Spanish and Italian), ''Alfons'' (Dutch, German, Catalan, Polish and Scandinavian), ''Afonso'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]),  ''[[Alphonse (given name)|Alphonse]]'', ''Alfonse'' (Italian, French and English), etc.
