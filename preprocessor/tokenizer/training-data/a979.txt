An '''autosome''' is a [[chromosome]] that is not an [[allosome]] (a sex chromosome).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Griffiths | first=Anthony J. F. | title=An Introduction to genetic analysis | year=1999 | publisher=W.H. Freeman | location=New York  | isbn=0-7167-3771-X | pages= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=autosome&amp;rid=iga.section.222}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The members of an autosome pair in a [[diploid]] cell have the same morphology unlike those in allosome pairs which may have different structure. The [[DNA]] in autosomes is collectively known as '''atDNA''' or '''auDNA'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isogg.org/wiki/Autosomal_DNA&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[human]]s have a [[diploid]] [[human genome|genome]] that usually contains 22 pairs of autosomes and one [[allosome]] pair (46 chromosomes total). The autosome pairs are labeled with numbers (1–22 in humans) roughly in order of their sizes in base pairs, while allosomes are labelled with their letters.&lt;ref&gt;http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=autosome&lt;/ref&gt;  By contrast, the allosome pair consists of two [[X chromosome]]s in females or one X and one [[Y chromosome]] in males. (Unusual combinations of [[XYY syndrome|XYY]], [[Klinefelter syndrome|XXY]], [[Triple X syndrome|XXX]], [[XXXX syndrome|XXXX]], [[XXXXX syndrome|XXXXX]] or [[XXYY syndrome|XXYY]], among [[Aneuploidy|other allosome combinations]], are known to occur and usually cause developmental abnormalities.)

Autosomes still contain sexual determination genes even though they are not sex chromosomes. For example, the [[SRY]] gene on the Y chromosome encodes the transcription factor [[Testis determining factor|TDF]] and is vital for male sex determination during development. TDF functions by activating the [[SOX9]] gene on [[Chromosome 17 (human)|chromosome 17]], so mutations of the [[SOX9]] gene can cause humans with a Y chromosome to develop as females.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Jamie W., et al. &quot;Campomelic dysplasia and autosomal sex reversal caused by mutations in an SRY-related gene.&quot; ''Nature'' 372.6506 (1994): 525–529.&lt;/ref&gt;

All human autosomes have been identified and mapped by extracting the chromosomes from a cell arrested in [[metaphase]] or [[prometaphase]] and then staining them with some sort of dye (most commonly, [[Giemsa stain|Giemsa]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chromosome mapping Facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Chromosome mapping|url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Chromosome_mapping.aspx|website = www.encyclopedia.com|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; These chromosomes are typically viewed as [[karyogram]]s for easy comparison. Clinical geneticists can compare the karyogram of an individual to a reference karyogram to discover the cytogenetic basis of certain [[phenotype]]s. For example, the karyogram of someone with [[Patau syndrome|Patau Syndrome]] would show that they possess three copies of [[Chromosome 13 (human)|chromosome 13]]. Karyograms and staining techniques can only detect large-scale disruptions to chromosomes—chromosomal aberrations smaller than a few million base pairs generally cannot be seen on a karyogram.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum RL, McInnes RR, Willard HF, Hamosh A, Thompson MW.

== Autosomal genetic disorders ==
[[File:Autosomal recessive inheritance.gif|thumb|An illustration of the inheritance pattern and phenotypic effects of an autosomal recessive gene.]]
Autosomal genetic disorders can arise due to a number of causes, some of the most common being [[nondisjunction]] in parental germ cells or [[Mendelian inheritance]] of deleterious alleles from parents. Autosomal genetic disorders which exhibit Mendelian inheritance can be inherited either in an [[autosomal dominant]] or recessive fashion.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; These disorders manifest in and are passed on by either sex with equal frequency.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = human genetic disease|url = http://www.britannica.com/science/human-genetic-disease|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gregor Mendel and Single-Gene Disorders {{!}} Learn Science at Scitable|url = http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/mendelian-genetics-patterns-of-inheritance-and-single-966|website = www.nature.com|accessdate = 2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Autosomal dominant disorders are often present in both parent and child, as the child needs to inherit only one copy of the deleterious [[allele]] to manifest the disease. Autosomal recessive diseases, however, require two copies of the deleterious allele for the disease to manifest. Because it is possible to possess one copy of a deleterious allele without presenting a disease phenotype, two phenotypically normal parents can have a child with the disease if both parents are carriers (also known as [[heterozygote]]s) for the condition.

Autosomal [[aneuploidy]] can also result in disease conditions. Aneuploidy of autosomes is not well tolerated and usually results in miscarriage of the developing fetus. Fetuses with aneuploidy of gene-rich chromosomes—such as [[Chromosome 1 (human)|chromosome 1]]—never survive to term,&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Autosomal Aneuploidy|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1385/1-59259-833-1%3A133|publisher = Humana Press|date = 2005-01-01|isbn = 978-1-58829-300-8|pages = 133–164|first = Jin-Chen C.|last = Wang|editor-first = Steven L.|editor-last = Gersen|editor-first2 = Martha B. Keagle|editor-last2 = MEd}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fetuses with aneuploidy of gene-poor chromosomes—such as [[Chromosome 21 (human)|chromosome 21]]— are still miscarried over 23% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Maternal age-specific fetal loss rates in Down syndrome pregnancies|journal = Prenatal Diagnosis|date = 2006-06-01|issn = 0197-3851|pmid = 16634111|pages = 499–504|volume = 26|issue = 6|doi = 10.1002/pd.1443|first = George M.|last = Savva|first2 = Joan K.|last2 = Morris|first3 = David E.|last3 = Mutton|first4 = Eva|last4 = Alberman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possessing a single copy of an autosome (known as a monosomy) is nearly always incompatible with life, though very rarely some monosomies can survive past birth. Having three copies of an autosome (known as a trisomy) is far more compatible with life, however. A common example is [[Down syndrome]], which is caused by possessing three copies of [[Chromosome 21 (human)|chromosome 21]] instead of the usual two.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

Partial aneuploidy can also occur as a result of [[Chromosomal translocation|unbalanced translocations]] during meiosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Translocation - Glossary Entry|url = http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=translocation|website = Genetics Home Reference|date = 2015-11-02|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deletions of part of a chromosome cause partial monosomies, while duplications can cause partial trisomies. If the duplication or deletion is large enough, it can be discovered by analyzing a karyogram of the individual. Autosomal translocations can be responsible for a number of diseases, ranging from [[cancer]] to [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Modeling the molecular consequences of unbalanced translocations in cancer: lessons from acute lymphoblastic leukemia|journal = Cell Cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)|date = 2009-07-15|issn = 1551-4005|pmid = 19556891|pages = 2175–2184|volume = 8|issue = 14|first = Jonathan C.|last = Strefford|first2 = Qian|last2 = An|first3 = Christine J.|last3 = Harrison|doi=10.4161/cc.8.14.9103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Chromosome 1;11 Translocation Provides the Best Evidence Supporting Genetic Etiology for Schizophrenia and Bipolar Affective Disorders|url = http://www.genetics.org/content/160/4/1745|journal = Genetics|date = 2002-04-01|issn = 0016-6731|pmc = 1462039|pmid = 11973326|pages = 1745–1747|volume = 160|issue = 4|first = Amar J.
