In [[mathematics]], a [[binary relation]] ''R'' on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' is '''anti-symmetric''' if there is no pair of distinct elements of ''X'' each of which is related by ''R'' to the other. More formally, ''R'' is anti-symmetric precisely if for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''X''
:if ''R(a,b)'' and ''R(b,a)'', then ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b'',
or, equivalently,
:if ''R(a,b)'' with ''a''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''b'', then ''R(b,a)'' must not hold.

As a simple example, the [[divisibility]] order on the [[natural number]]s is an anti-symmetric relation. In this context, anti-symmetry means that the only way each of two numbers can be divisible by the other is if the two are, in fact, the same number; equivalently, if ''n'' and ''m'' are distinct and ''n'' is a factor of ''m'', then ''m'' cannot be a factor of ''n''.

In [[mathematical notation]], this is:

:&lt;math&gt;\forall a, b \in X,\ (aRb \and bRa) \; \Rightarrow \; a = b&lt;/math&gt;

or, equivalently,

&lt;!-- this is the same formula as above, but due to the addition of the negation, it is more clear where the term anti-symmetric comes from --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall a, b \in X,\ (aRb \and a \ne b \Rightarrow \lnot  bRa) .&lt;/math&gt;

The usual [[order relation]] ≤ on the [[real number]]s is anti-symmetric: if for two real numbers ''x'' and ''y'' both [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]] ''x''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''y'' and ''y''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''x'' hold then ''x'' and ''y'' must be equal. Similarly,  the [[subset order]] ⊆ on the subsets of any given set is anti-symmetric: given two sets ''A'' and ''B'', if every [[Element (mathematics)|element]] in ''A'' also is in ''B'' and every element in ''B'' is also in ''A'', then ''A'' and ''B'' must contain all the same elements and therefore be equal:
:&lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B \and B \subseteq A \Rightarrow A = B&lt;/math&gt;

[[partial order|Partial]] and [[total order]]s are anti-symmetric by definition. A relation can be both [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] and anti-symmetric (e.g., [[equality (mathematics)|the equality relation]]), and there are relations which are neither symmetric nor anti-symmetric (e.g., the &quot;preys on&quot; relation on biological [[species]]).

Anti-symmetry is different from [[Asymmetric relation|asymmetry]], which requires both anti-symmetry and [[reflexive relation|irreflexivity]].

==Examples==
The relation &quot;''x'' is even, ''y'' is odd&quot; between a pair (''x'', ''y'') of [[integer]]s is anti-symmetric:

Every [[asymmetric relation]] is also an anti-symmetric relation.
