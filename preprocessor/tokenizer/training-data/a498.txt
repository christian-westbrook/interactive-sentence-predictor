The meaning of the word '''American''' in the English language varies according to the historical, geographical, and political context in which it is used. ''American'' is derived from ''America'', a term originally denoting all of the [[New World]] (also called ''the [[Americas]]''). In some expressions, it retains this Pan-American sense, but its usage has evolved over time and, for various historical reasons, the word came to denote people or things specifically from the [[United States of America]].

In modern English, ''[[Americans]]'' generally refers to persons or things related to the United States of America; among native English speakers this usage is almost universal, with any other use of the term requiring specification.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Kenneth G.|title=The Columbia Guide to Standard American English|year=1993|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-06989-8|pages=27–28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L2ChiO2yEZ0C&amp;pg=PA27}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20080316032628/http://www.bartleby.com/68/37/337.html View at Bartleby]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this usage is seen by some as a semantic &quot;misappropriation&quot; by those who argue that &quot;American&quot; [[Linguistic prescription|should be widened]] in English [[semantic change|to also include]] people or things from anywhere in the American continents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mencken&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | first = H.

The word can be used as either an [[adjective]] or a [[noun]] (viz. a [[demonym]]). In adjectival use, it means &quot;of or relating to the United States&quot;; for example, &quot;[[Elvis Presley]] was an American singer&quot; or &quot;the man prefers [[American English]]&quot;. In its noun form, the word generally means a [[demographics of the US|resident]] or [[United States nationality law|citizen]] of the US, or occasionally [[American ethnicity|someone whose ethnic identity is simply &quot;American&quot;]]. The noun is rarely used in [[American English]] to refer to people not connected to the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;/&gt; When used with a [[Grammatical modifier|grammatical qualifier]], the adjective ''American'' can mean &quot;of or relating to the Americas&quot;, as in [[Latin America]]n or [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American]]. Less frequently, the adjective can take this meaning without a qualifier, as in &quot;[[Spanish dialects and varieties|American Spanish]] dialects and pronunciation differ by country&quot;, or the name of the [[Organization of American States]]. A third use of the term pertains specifically to the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]], for instance, &quot;In the 16th century, many Americans died from imported diseases during the European conquest&quot;.

Compound constructions such as &quot;[[African Americans]]&quot; likewise refer exclusively to people in or from the United States of America, as does the [[prefix]] &quot;[[:wiktionary:Americo-|Americo-]]&quot;. For instance, the [[Americo-Liberians]] and their language [[Merico language|Merico]] derive their name from the fact that they are [[African-American settlement in Africa|descended from African American settlers]], i.e. former slaves in the United States of America.

They generally have other terms specific to U.S. nationals, such as the German ''{{lang|de|US-Amerikaner}}'',&lt;ref name=&quot;de-dict&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/cgi-bin/wort_www.exe?site=1&amp;Wort=US-Amerikaner|title=US-Amerikaner|encyclopedia=Wortschatz|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; French ''{{lang|fr|étatsunien}}'',&lt;ref name=&quot;french-etatsunien&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://correcteurs.blog.lemonde.fr/2007/07/06/etats-uniens-ou-americains-that-is-the-question/|title=Etats-Uniens ou Américains, that is the question|newspaper=[[Le Monde]]|date=July 6, 2007|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese {{nihongo||米国人|beikokujin}},&lt;ref name=&quot;jap-dict-detail&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webdico.com:8080/kanji/quicks?dbname=kokug&amp;sword=American&amp;stype=1|title=American|work=Online English-Japanese Pictorial Dictionary|publisher=Free Light Software}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic ''{{transl|ar|amrīkānī}}'' ({{rtl-lang|ar|أمريكاني}} as opposed to ''{{transl|ar|amrīkī}}'' {{rtl-lang|ar|أمريكي}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arabic-English translation for &quot;أَمْريكيّ&quot;|url=http://en.bab.la/dictionary/arabic-english/%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A|website=Bab.la Dictionary|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in source|date=March 2017}} and Italian ''{{lang|it|statunitense}}''.&lt;ref name=&quot;dict-it&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/iten/statunitense|title=statunitense|work=WordReference English-Italiano Dictionary|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These specific terms may be less common than the term ''American''.&lt;ref name=&quot;french-etatsunien&quot;/&gt;

In French, ''{{lang|fr|états-unien}}'', ''{{lang|fr|étas-unien}}'' or ''{{lang|fr|étasunien}}'', from ''{{lang|fr|États-Unis d'Amérique}}'' (&quot;United States of America&quot;), is a rarely used word that distinguishes U.S. things and persons from the adjective ''{{lang|fr|américain}}'', which denotes persons and things from the United States, but may also refer to &quot;the Americas&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;french-etatsunien&quot;/&gt;

Likewise, German's use of ''{{lang|de|U.S.-amerikanisch}}'' and ''{{lang|de|U.S.-Amerikaner}}''&lt;ref name=&quot;de-dict&quot;/&gt; observe said cultural distinction, solely denoting U.S. things and people. Note that these are &quot;politically correct&quot; terms and that in normal parlance, the adjective &quot;American&quot; and its direct cognates are usually used if the context renders the nationality of the person clear.

This differentiation is prevalent in German-speaking countries, as indicated by the [[style manual]] of the ''[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]'' (one of the leading German-language newspapers in Switzerland) which dismisses the term ''{{lang|de|U.S.-amerikanisch}}'' as both ′unnecessary′ and ′artificial′ and recommends replacing it with ''amerikanisch''.&lt;ref&gt;''Vademecum. Der sprachlich-technische Leitfaden der «Neuen Zürcher Zeitung»'', 13th edition. Verlag Neue Zürcher Zeitung, Zürich 2013, p. 102, s. v. ''US-amerikanisch''.&lt;/ref&gt; The respective guidelines of the foreign ministries of Austria, Germany and Switzerland all prescribe ''Amerikaner'' and ''amerikanisch'' in reference to the United States for official usage, making no mention of ''{{lang|de|U.S.-Amerikaner}}'' or ''{{lang|de|U.S.-amerikanisch}}''.&lt;ref&gt;Eidgenössisches Departement für auswärtige Angelegenheiten: [http://www.eda.admin.ch/etc/medialib/downloads/edazen/topics/intla/cintla.Par.0011.File.tmp/lt_080506_statenames_de.pdf „Liste der Staatenbezeichnungen“]; Bundesministerium für europäische und internationale Angelegenheiten: [http://www.bmeia.gv.at/fileadmin/user_upload/oracle/staatennamen_de.pdf „Liste der Staatennamen und deren Ableitungen in den vom Bundesministerium für europäische und internationale Angelegenheiten verwendeten Formen“]; Auswärtiges Amt: [http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/cae/servlet/contentblob/332368/publicationFile/3097/Staatennamen.pdf „Verzeichnis der Staatennamen für den amtlichen Gebrauch in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland“]&lt;/ref&gt;

Portuguese has ''{{lang|pt|americano}}'', denoting both a person or thing from the Americas and a U.S. national.&lt;ref name=&quot;pt-americano&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Dicionário Priberam da Língua Portuguesa|url=http://www.priberam.pt/dlpo/default.aspx?pal=americano|title=americano|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; For referring specifically to a U.S. national and things, some words used are ''{{lang|pt|estadunidense}}'' (also spelled ''{{lang|pt|estado-unidense}}'', &quot;United States person&quot;), from ''{{lang|pt|Estados Unidos da América}}'', and ''{{lang|pt|ianque}}'' (&quot;Yankee&quot;)—both usages exist in Brazil, but are uncommon in Portugal—but the term most often used, and the only one in Portugal, is ''{{lang|pt|norte-americano}}'', even though it could, as with its Spanish equivalent, apply to Canadians, Mexicans, etc. as well.

In Spanish, ''{{lang|es|americano}}'' denotes geographic and cultural origin in the New World, as well as (infrequently) a U.S. citizen;&lt;ref name=&quot;rae-americano&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=[[Diccionario de la lengua española]]|title=americano|url=http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltGUIBusUsual?TIPO_HTML=2&amp;TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=americano|publisher=Real Academia Española|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Pequeño Larousse Ilustrado 1992 edition, look up word Americano: Contains the Observation: Debe evitarse el empleo de americano con el sentido de norteamericano o de los Estados Unidos|trans_title=Usage of the word with the meaning of U.S. citizen or the United States must be avoided | url = |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The first two definitions in ''[[Diccionario de la lengua española]]'' (the [[Linguistic prescription#Authority|official dictionary]] in Spanish) define ''{{lang|es|americano}}'' as &quot;Native of America&quot; [''{{lang|es|Natural de América}}''] and &quot;Pertaining or relating to this part of the world&quot; [''{{lang|es|Perteneciente o relativo a esta parte del mundo}}''], where ''{{lang|es|América}}'' refers to the continent.{{refn|{{cite encyclopedia|title=América|encyclopedia=WordReference English-Spanish Dictionary|url=http://www.wordreference.com/es/en/translation.asp?spen=Am%C3%A9rica}}}} The fourth definition of ''{{lang|es|americano}}'' is defined as &quot;United States person&quot; [''{{lang|es|estadounidense}}''].}} the more common term is ''{{lang|es|estadounidense}}'' (&quot;United States person&quot;), which derives from ''{{lang|es|Estados Unidos de América}}'' (&quot;United States of America&quot;). The Spanish term ''{{lang|es|norteamericano}}'' (&quot;North American&quot;) is frequently used to refer things and persons from the United States, but this term can also denote people and things from Canada and Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;rae-estadosunidos&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Diccionario panhispánico de dudas|url=http://buscon.rae.es/dpd/?key=norteamericano&amp;origen=REDPD|title=norteamericano|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Spanish-speakers, North America generally doesn't include Central America or the Caribbean.

In other languages, however, there is no possibility for confusion. For example, the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] word for &quot;U.S. national&quot; is ''{{transl|zh|měiguórén}}'' ({{zh|t=美國人|s=美国人}})&lt;ref name=&quot;zh-dict-us-natural&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/zhen/%E7%BE%8E%E5%9B%BD%E4%BA%BA|title=美国人|work=WordReference English-Chinese Dictionary|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|''{{transl|zh|Měiguórén}}'' is the [[Standard Mandarin]] pronunciation.}} is derived from a word for the United States, ''{{transl|zh|měiguó}}'', where ''{{transl|zh|měi}}'' is an abbreviation for ''Yàměilìjiā'' (&quot;America&quot;) and ''{{transl|zh|guó}}'' is &quot;country&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;zh-dict-us&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/enzh/United%20States|title=United States|work=WordReference English-Chinese Dictionary|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;zh-dict-america&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/enzh/America|title=America|work=WordReference English-Chinese Dictionary|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;zh-dict-country&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/enzh/country|title=country|work=WordReference English-Chinese Dictionary|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name for the American continents is ''{{transl|zh|měizhōu}}'', from ''{{transl|zh|měi}}'' plus ''{{transl|zh|zhōu}}'' (&quot;continent&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;zh-dict-continent&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/enzh/continent|title=continent|work=WordReference English-Chinese Dictionary|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a ''{{transl|zh|měi'''zhōu'''rén}}'' is an American in the continent sense, and a ''{{transl|zh|měi'''guó'''rén}}'' is an American in the U.S. sense.{{efn|Chinese: ''{{transl|zh|měiguó}}'' (&quot;United States&quot;) is written as {{lang|zh|美国}}, ''{{transl|zh|měizhōu}}'' (&quot;America the continent&quot;) is written as {{lang|zh|美洲}}, ''{{transl|zh|guó}}'' (&quot;country&quot;) is written as {{lang|zh|国}}, and ''{{transl|zh|zhōu}}'' (&quot;continent&quot;) is written as {{lang|zh|洲}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;zh-dict-us&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;zh-dict-america&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;zh-dict-country&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;zh-dict-continent&quot;/&gt;}}

Conversely, in [[Czech language|Czech]], there is no possibility for disambiguation. ''[[:wiktionary:Američan|Američan]]'' (m.) and ''[[:wiktionary:Američanka|američanka]]'' (f.) can refer to persons from the United States or from the continents of the Americas, and there is no specific word capable of distinguishing the two meanings. For this reason, the latter meaning is very rarely used, and word ''američan(ka)'' is used almost exclusively to refer to persons from the United States. The usage is exactly parallel to the English word.

[[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] also use unambiguous terms, with Korean having ''{{transl|ko|Migug}}'' ({{lang|ko|미국(인)}}) for the country versus ''{{transl|ko|Amerika}}'' ({{lang|ko|아메리카}}) for the continents,&lt;ref name=&quot;ko-dict-america&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/enko/america|title=america|work=WordReference English-Korean Dictionary|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Vietnamese having ''{{lang|vi|Hoa Kỳ}}'' for the country versus ''{{lang|vi|Châu Mỹ}}'' for the continents.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} [[Japanese language|Japanese]] has such terms as well (''{{transl|ja|beikoku(jin)}}'' [{{lang|ja|米国(人)}} versus ''{{transl|ja|beishū(jin)}}'' [{{lang|ja|米洲人}}]), but they are found more in newspaper headlines than in speech, where ''{{transl|ja|amerikajin}}'' predominates.{{efn|name=ja-american}}{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In [[Swahili language|Swahili]], ''{{lang|sw|Marekani}}'' means specifically the United States, and ''{{lang|sw|Mwamarekani}}'' is a U.S. national, whereas the international form ''{{lang|sw|Amerika}}'' refers to the continents, and ''{{lang|sw|Mwaamerika}}'' would be an inhabitants thereof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sw.bab.la/kamusi/kiingereza-kiswahili/united-states|title=United States|publisher=Wasilana &amp; Amana|work=bab.la}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sw.bab.la/kamusi/kiswahili-kiingereza/amerika|title=amerika|publisher=Wasilana &amp; Amana|work=bab.la}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sw.bab.la/kamusi/kiingereza-kiswahili/american|title=American|publisher=Wasilana &amp; Amana|work=bab.la}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|In Swahili, adding the prefix ''mwa-'' to a word indicates a person (''wa-'' would indicate people).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masai-mara.com/mmsw2.htm|title=Introduction to Swahili|author=Youngman, Jeremy|work=Masai Mara}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Likewise, the [[Esperanto]] word ''{{lang|eo|Ameriko}}'' refers to the continents. For the country there is the term ''{{lang|eo|Usono}}''. Thus, a citizen of the United States is an ''{{lang|eo|usonano}}'', whereas an ''{{lang|eo|amerikano}}'' is an inhabitant of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esperanto.mobi/en/dictionary-esperanto-english/Ameriko|title=Ameriko|work=Esperanto–English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esperanto.mobi/en/dictionary-esperanto-english/Usono|title=Usono|work=Esperanto–English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esperanto.mobi/en/dictionary-esperanto-english/usonano|title=usonano|work=Esperanto–English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{link language|eo}} {{cite web|url=http://reta-vortaro.de/revo/art/amerik.html|title=Reta Vortaro|trans_title=Internet Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] the term amerikai (American) refers to a person or a thing from the [[United States]].

==History==
[[File:Portrait of Amerigo Vespucci.jpg|thumb|200px|''America'' is named after Italian explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-04-24-america-turns-500_N.htm?csp=34 |title=Cartographer Put 'America' on the Map 500 years Ago |work=USA Today |location =Washington, D.C. |date=April 24, 2007 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=November 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The name ''America'' was coined by [[Martin Waldseemüller]]  from ''Americus Vespucius'', the Latinized version of the name of [[Amerigo Vespucci]] (1454–1512), the Italian explorer who mapped South America's east coast and the [[Caribbean]] Sea in the early 16th century. Later, Vespucci's published letters were the basis of [[Waldseemüller map|Waldseemüller's 1507 map]], which is the first usage of ''America''. The adjective ''American'' subsequently denoted the New World.

16th-century European usage of ''American'' denoted the native inhabitants of the New World.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;&gt;{{subscription required}} {{cite encyclopedia|url=http://dictionary.oed.com.dax.lib.unf.edu/cgi/entry/50007152?query_type=word&amp;queryword=American&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=870u-gw0naW-7329&amp;hilite=50007152|title=American|encyclopedia=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|accessdate=November 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded use of this term in English is in [[Thomas Hacket]]'s 1568 translation of [[André Thévet]]'s book ''[[France Antarctique]]''; Thévet himself had referred to the natives as ''Ameriques''.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;/&gt; In the following century, the term was extended to European settlers and their descendants in the Americas. The earliest recorded use of &quot;English-American&quot; dates to 1648, in [[Thomas Gage (clergyman)|Thomas Gage]]'s ''The English-American his travail by sea and land: or, a new survey of the West India's''.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;/&gt;

In English, ''American'' was used especially for people in the [[British America]].  [[Samuel Johnson]], the leading English lexicographer, wrote in 1775, before the United States declared independence: &quot;That the Americans are able to bear taxation is indubitable.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;/&gt; The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence of July 1776]] refers to &quot;[the] unanimous Declaration of the thirteen United States of America&quot; adopted by the &quot;Representatives of the United States of America&quot; on July 4, 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_zoom_2.html|title=Declaration of Independence|publisher=National Archives|date=July 4, 1776}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official name of the country was reaffirmed on November 15, 1777, when the [[Second Continental Congress]] adopted the [[Articles of Confederation]], the first of which says, &quot;The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America'&quot;. The Articles further state:
{{quote|In Witness whereof we have hereunto set our hands in Congress. Done at Philadelphia in the State of Pennsylvania the ninth day of July in the Year of our Lord One Thousand Seven Hundred and Seventy-Eight, and in the Third Year of the independence of America.}}
[[File:Bowen America.png|thumb|300px|left|British map of the Americas in 1744.]]
Sam Haselby, a history professor in Lebanon and Egypt, claims it was British officials who first called the colonists &quot;Americans&quot;. When the drafters of the ''Declaration'' — [[Thomas Jefferson]] from Virginia, for example, or [[John Adams]] from Massachusetts — talked about &quot;my country&quot;, they meant Virginia or Massachusetts, respectively. This situation was changed by the Revolution and the impulse toward nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon S. Wood|Wood, Gordon S.]] (2015), [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2015/jul/09/different-story-what-shaped-america/ &quot;A Different Story of What Shaped America&quot;], ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', July 9 issue.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson, newly elected president in May 1801 wrote, &quot;I am sure the measures I mean to pursue are such as would in their nature be approved by every American who can emerge from preconceived prejudices; as for those who cannot, we must take care of them as of the sick in our hospitals. The medicine of time and fact may cure some of them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter TJ to Theodore Foster, May 1801, in Paul Leicester Ford ed., ''The Works of Thomas Jefferson'' (1905) 8:50.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' (1787–88), [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]] used the adjective ''American'' with two different meanings: one political and one geographic; &quot;the American republic&quot; in [[Federalist No. 51]] and in [[Federalist No. 70]],&lt;ref name=federalist51&gt;{{cite book|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Federalist/51|chapter=The Structure of the Government Must Furnish the Proper Checks and Balances Between the Different Departments|title=The Federalist|number=51|author=Madison, James}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=federalist70&gt;{{cite book|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers/No._70|author=Hamilton, Alexander|chapter=The Executive Department Further Considered|title=The Federalist|number=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in [[Federalist No. 24]], Hamilton used ''American'' to denote the lands beyond the U.S.'s political borders.&lt;ref name=federalist24&gt;{{cite book | first = Alexander | last = Hamilton | title = The Federalist Papers | number = 24 | url = http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Federalist/24l | chapter = The Powers Necessary to the Common Defense Further Considered}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early official U.S. documents show inconsistent usage; the [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|1778 Treaty of Alliance]] with [[France]] used &quot;the United States of North America&quot; in the first sentence, then &quot;the said United States&quot; afterwards; &quot;the United States of America&quot; and &quot;the United States of North America&quot; derive from &quot;the United Colonies of America&quot; and &quot;the United Colonies of North America&quot;. The Treaty of Peace and Amity of September 5, 1795, between the United States and the [[Barbary States]] contains the usages &quot;the United States of North America&quot;, &quot;citizens of the United States&quot;, and &quot;American Citizens&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/bar1795t.asp | title = The Barbary Treaties: Treaty of Peace and Amity}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{synthesis inline|date=October 2013}}

[[File:Washington's Farewell Address.jpg|thumb|''[[Washington's Farewell Address]]'' (1796)]]
U.S. President [[George Washington]], in his [[Washington's Farewell Address|1796 ''Farewell Address'']], declaimed that &quot;The name of American, which belongs to you in your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of patriotism more than any appellation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:Washington's Farewell Address]]&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist Virginia L. Arbery notes that, in his ''Farewell Address'':&lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;...Washington invites his fellow citizens to view themselves now as Americans who, out of their love for the truth of liberty, have replaced their maiden names (Virginians, South Carolinians, New Yorkers, etc.) with that of “American”. Get rid of, he urges, “any appellation derived from local discriminations.” By defining himself as an American rather than as a Virginian, Washington set the national standard for all citizens. &quot;Over and over, Washington said that America must be something set apart. As he put it to [[Patrick Henry]], 'In a word, I want an ''American'' character, that the powers of Europe may be convinced we act for ''ourselves'' and not for ''others''.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Arbery, Virginia L. (1999), &quot;Washington's Farewell Address and the Form of the American Regime&quot;; In: Gary L. Gregg II and Matthew Spalding, ''Patriot Sage: George Washington and the American Political Tradition'', pp. 204, 206.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;As the historian [[Garry Wills]] has noted: &quot;This was a theme dear to Washington. He wrote to [[Timothy Pickering]] that the nation 'must never forget that we are Americans; the remembrance of which will convince us we ought not to be French or English'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Garry Wills|Wills, Garry]] (1984), ''Cincinnatus: George Washington and the Enlightenment'', pp. 92-93.&lt;/ref&gt; Washington's countrymen subsequently embraced his exhortation with notable enthusiasm.

This semantic divergence among North American [[English-speaking world|anglophones]], however, remained largely unknown in the Spanish-American colonies. In 1801, the document titled ''Letter to American Spaniards''—published in French (1799), in Spanish (1801), and in English (1808)—might have influenced [[Venezuela]]'s [[Venezuelan Declaration of Independence|Act of Independence]] and its 1811 constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.histal.umontreal.ca/espanol/documentos/la%20carta%20dirigida%20a%20los%20espanoles%20americanos.htm | title = La &quot;Carta dirigida a los españoles americanos&quot;, una carta que recorrió muchos caminos..|trans_title=The &quot;Letter directed to Spanish Americans&quot;, a letter that traversed many paths...|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127135222/http://www.histal.umontreal.ca/espanol/documentos/la%20carta%20dirigida%20a%20los%20espanoles%20americanos.htm|archivedate=January 27, 2010|author=Bastin, Georges L.

The [[Latter-day Saints]]' [[Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)|Articles of Faith]] refer to the American continents as where they are to build Zion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/a_of_f/1/10#10|title=Articles of Faith 1:10|author=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints|quote=We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion (the New Jerusalem) will be built upon the American continent...}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Common short forms and abbreviations are the ''United States'', the ''U.S.'', the ''U.S.A.'', and ''America''; colloquial versions include the ''U.S. of A.'' and ''the States''. The term ''[[Columbia (name)|Columbia]]'' (from the Columbus surname) was a popular name for the U.S. and for the entire geographic Americas; its usage is present today in the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]'s name. Moreover, the womanly personification of Columbia appears in some official documents, including editions of the U.S. dollar.

==Usage at the United Nations==
Use of the term ''American'' for U.S. nationals is common at the [[United Nations]],{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} and financial markets in the United States are referred to as &quot;American financial markets&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs/2009/090326_GA.doc.htm|title=Financial Reform Recommendations to General Assembly|date=March 26, 2009|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[American Samoa]]'' is a recognized territorial name at the United Nations.&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/ittmig2002/locations/016.htm|title=American Samoa|publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division|accessdate=August 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural views==

===Spain and Hispanic America===
The use of ''American'' as a national [[demonym]] for U.S. nationals is challenged, primarily by Hispanic Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mencken&quot;/&gt; Spanish speakers in Spain and Latin America use the term ''{{lang|es|estadounidense}}'' to refer to people and things from the United States (from ''{{lang|es|Estados Unidos}}''), while ''{{lang|es|americano}}'' refers to the [[the Americas|continents]] as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;rae-americano&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rae-estadounidense&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Diccionario de la lengua española|title=estadounidense|url=http://lema.rae.es/drae/?val=estadounidense|publisher=Real Academia Española|quote=[Translated:] 1. adj. Native of the United States of America|language=es}} [Original:] &quot;1. adj. Natural de los Estados Unidos de América.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''{{lang|es|gringo}}'' is also accepted in many parts of Latin America to refer to a person or something from the United States,&lt;ref name=&quot;rae-gringo&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Diccionario de la lengua española|title=gringo|url=http://dle.rae.es/?id=JY0Q3cz|publisher=Real Academia Española|quote=[Translated:] 3. adj.

Bol., Chile, Col., Cuba, Ec., El Salv., Hond., Nic., Par., Perú, Ur. y Ven. estadounidense.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; however this term may be ambiguous in certain parts.  Up to and including the 1992 edition, the ''{{lang|es|Diccionario de la lengua española}}'', published by the [[Real Academia Española]], did not include the United States definition in the entry for ''{{lang|es|americano}}''; this was added in the 2001 edition.&lt;ref name=&quot;rae-americano&quot;/&gt;{{efn|name=rae-americano-note}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|publisher=Real Academia Española |encyclopedia=Diccionario usual |year=1992 |edition=21st |page=89 |title=americano |url=http://buscon.rae.es/ntlle/SrvltGUILoginNtlle |language=es |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501220632/http://buscon.rae.es/ntlle/SrvltGUILoginNtlle |archivedate=2006-05-01 }} To access, click the magnifying glass in the upper left-hand corner.

Then click &quot;Buscar&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The Real Academia Española advised against using ''{{lang|es|americanos}}'' exclusively for U.S. nationals:&lt;ref name=&quot;rae-estadosunidos&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lema.rae.es/dpd/srv/search?id=4EWtRO1VZD6v7sHSpo|title=Estados Unidos|publisher=Real Academia Española|accessdate=2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|[Translated] It is common, and thus acceptable, to use ''{{lang|es|norteamericano}}'' as a synonym of ''{{lang|es|estadounidense}}'', even though strictly speaking, the term ''norteamericano'' can equally be used to refer to the inhabitants of any country in North America, it normally applies to the inhabitants of the United States. But ''americano'' should not be used to refer exclusively to the inhabitants of the United States, an abusive usage which can be explained by the fact that in the United States, they frequently abbreviate the name of the country to &quot;America&quot; (in English, with no accent).{{efn|name=rae-americano-note|[Untranslated] {{lang|es|Está muy generalizado, y resulta aceptable, el uso de norteamericano como sinónimo de estadounidense, ya que, aunque en rigor el término norteamericano podría usarse igualmente en alusión a los habitantes de cualquiera de los países de América del Norte o Norteamérica, se aplica corrientemente a los habitantes de los Estados Unidos.  Pero debe evitarse el empleo de americano para referirse exclusivamente a los habitantes de los Estados Unidos, uso abusivo que se explica por el hecho de que los estadounidenses utilizan a menudo el nombre abreviado América (en inglés, sin tilde) para referirse a su país.}} }} }}

===Canada===
Modern Canadians typically refer to people from the United States as ''Americans'', though they seldom refer to the United States as ''America''; they use the terms ''the United States'', ''the U.S.'', or (informally) ''the States'' instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxfcdn&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Fee, Margery|author2=McAlpine, J.|year=1997|title=Oxford Guide to Canadian English Usage|isbn=0-19-541619-8|location=Toronto|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadians rarely apply the term ''American'' to themselves – some Canadians resent either being referred to as Americans because of mistaken assumptions that they are U.S. citizens or others' inability, particularly of those overseas, to distinguish [[Canadian English|Canadian]] from [[American English|American]] [[Accent (dialect)|accents]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oxfcdn&quot;/&gt; Some Canadians have protested the use of ''American'' as a national demonym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Ford|first=Miriam Allen|date=April 1927|title=On the difficulty of indicating nativity in the United States|journal=American Speech|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; People of U.S. ethnic origin in Canada are categorized as &quot;Other North American origins&quot; by [[Statistics Canada]] for purposes of [[census]] counts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/demo26a-eng.htm|title=Population by selected ethnic origins, by province and territory (2006 Census)|publisher=Statistics Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portugal and Brazil===
Generally, ''{{lang|pt|americano}}'' denotes &quot;U.S. citizen&quot; in [[Portugal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pt-americano&quot;/&gt; Usage of ''{{lang|pt|americano}}'' to exclusively denote people and things of the U.S. is discouraged by the [[Academia das Ciências de Lisboa|Lisbon Academy of Sciences]], because the specific word ''{{lang|pt|estado-unidense}}'' (also ''{{lang|pt|estadunidense}}'') clearly denotes a person from the United States. The term currently used by the Portuguese press is ''{{lang|pt|norte-americano}}''.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In [[Brazil]], the term ''{{lang|pt|americano}}'' is used to address both that which pertains to both American continents and, in current speech, that which pertains to the U.S.; the particular meaning is deduced from context. Alternatively, the term ''{{lang|pt|norte-americano}}'' (&quot;North American&quot;) is also used in more informal contexts, while ''{{lang|pt|estadunidense}}'' (of the U.S.) is the preferred form in academia. Use of the three terms is common in schools, government, and media. The term ''{{lang|pt|América}}'' is used almost exclusively for the continents, and the U.S. is called ''{{lang|pt|Estados Unidos}}'' (&quot;United States&quot;) or ''{{lang|pt|Estados Unidos da América}}'' (&quot;United States of America&quot;), often abbreviated ''{{lang|pt|EUA}}''.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The Getting Through Customs website advises business travelers not to use &quot;in America&quot; as a U.S. reference when conducting business in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morrison |first=Terri |authorlink= |title=Doing business abroad – Brazil |work= |publisher= |date= |url=http://www.getcustoms.com/2004GTC/Articles/oag_11.html |doi= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205081049/http://www.getcustoms.com/2004GTC/Articles/oag_11.html |archivedate=2007-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other contexts==
&quot;American&quot; in the 1994 ''[[AP Stylebook|Associated Press Stylebook]]'' was defined as, &quot;An acceptable description for a resident of the United States. It also may be applied to any resident or citizen of nations in North or South America.&quot; Elsewhere, the ''AP Stylebook'' indicates that &quot;United States&quot; must &quot;be spelled out when used as a noun. Use U.S. (no space) only as an adjective.&quot;{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The entry for &quot;America&quot; in ''[[The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage]]'' from 1999 reads:
{{quote|[the] terms &quot;America&quot;, &quot;American(s)&quot; and &quot;Americas&quot; refer not only to the United States, but to all of North America and South America. They may be used in any of their senses, including references to just the United States, if the context is clear. The countries of the Western Hemisphere are collectively 'the Americas'.}}

Media releases from the [[Pope]] and [[Holy See]] frequently use &quot;America&quot; to refer to the United States, and &quot;American&quot; to denote something or someone from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/homilies/1965/documents/hf_p-vi_hom_19651004_yankee-stadium_en.html|title=Homily of the Holy Father Paul VI|location=Yankee Stadium, New York|date=October 4, 1965|authorlink=Pope Paul VI|author=Pope Paul VI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International law===
{{synthesis|date=October 2013}}
At least one international law uses ''U.S. citizen'' in defining a citizen of the United States rather than ''American citizen''; for example, the English version of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] includes:
{{quote|Only air carriers that are &quot;citizens of the United States&quot; may operate aircraft in domestic air service (cabotage) and may provide international scheduled and non-scheduled air service as U.S. air carriers...
Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, a &quot;citizen of the United States&quot; means:
:(a) an individual who is a U.S. citizen;
:(b) a partnership in which each member is a U.S. citizen; or
:(c) a U.S. corporation of which the president and at least two-thirds of the board of directors and other managing officers are U.S. citizens, and at least 75 percent of the voting interest in the corporation is owned or controlled by U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sice.oas.org/trade/nafta/anx1usa.asp | work = North American Free Trade Agreement|title=Annex I: Reservations for Existing Measures and Liberalization Commitments (Chapters 11, 12, and 14) |date= October 7, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many international treaties use the terms ''American'' and ''American citizen'':
* 1796 – The treaty between the United States and the [[Dey]] of the Regency of [[Algiers]] on March 7, 1796, protected &quot;American citizens&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/georgewashington/collection/pres_1796mar7.html|title= Treaty between US and the Dey and Regency of Algiers, March 7, 1796|work=Gilder Lehrman Collection Documents|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1806 – The [[Louisiana Purchase Treaty]] between [[France]] and United States referred to &quot;American citizens&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/resources/archives/one/louispur.htm |title=The Louisiana Purchase Treaty|work=Archives of The West|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1825 – The treaty between the United States and the [[Cheyenne]] tribe refers to &quot;American citizen&quot;s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpeople.us/FP-Html-Treaties/TreatyWithTheCheyenneTribe1825.html|title=Treaty with The Cheyenne Tribe|date=July 6, 1825}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1848 – The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] between [[Mexico]] and the U.S. uses &quot;American Government&quot; to refer to the United States, and &quot;American tribunals&quot; to refer to U.S. courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laprensa-sandiego.org/archieve/september21/treaty.htm|title=The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo|work=La Prensa}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1858 – The [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States-Japan)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] between the United States and [[Japan]] protected &quot;American citizens&quot; and also used &quot;American&quot; in other contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://core.ecu.edu/hist/tuckerjo/harris.html|title=The Treaty of Amity and Commerce Between the United States and Japan, 1858 (The Harris Treaty)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1898 – The [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] ending the [[Spanish–American War]], known in Spanish as the ''{{lang|es|Guerra Hispano–Estadounidense}}'' (&quot;Spain–United States War&quot;) uses &quot;American&quot; in reference to United States troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/sp1898.asp|title=Treaty of Peace Between the United States and Spain; December 10, 1898}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1966 – The [[Treaty of Amity and Economic Relations (Thailand–United States)|United States–Thailand Treaty of Amity]] protects &quot;Americans&quot; and &quot;American corporations&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bia.co.th/006.html|title=The United States–Thailand Treaty of Amity|work=Thailand Business and Legal Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. commercial regulation===
Products that are labeled, advertised, and marketed in the U.S. as &quot;[[Made in USA label|Made in the USA]]&quot; must be, as set by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), &quot;all or virtually all made in the U.S.&quot; The FTC, to prevent deception of customers and unfair competition, considers an unqualified claim of &quot;American Made&quot; to expressly claim exclusive manufacture in the U.S: &quot;The [[FTC Act]] gives the Commission the power to bring law enforcement actions against false or misleading claims that a product is of U.S. origin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/madeusa.htm|title=Complying with the Made In the USA Standard|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216200917/http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/madeusa.htm|archivedate=February 16, 2006|publisher=Federal Trade Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
{{Main article|Names for United States citizens}}
There are a number of alternatives to the [[demonym]] ''American'' as a citizen of the United States that do not simultaneously mean any inhabitant of the Americas. One uncommon alternative is ''[[Usonian]]'', which usually describes a certain style of residential [[architecture]] designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. Other alternatives have also surfaced, but most have fallen into disuse and obscurity. ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'s Dictionary of English Usage'' says:
{{quote|The list contains (in approximate historical order from 1789 to 1939) such terms as Columbian, Columbard, Fredonian, Frede, Unisian, United Statesian, Colonican, Appalacian, Usian, Washingtonian, Usonian, Uessian, U-S-ian, Uesican, United Stater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage|page=88|publisher=Merriam-Webster|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Nevertheless, no alternative to ''American'' is common.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;
