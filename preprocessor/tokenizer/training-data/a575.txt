'''Anbar''' ({{lang-ar|الأنبار|links=no}}) was a town in [[Iraq]], at lat. 33 deg.  22' N., long. 43 deg.  49' E, on the east bank of the [[Euphrates]], just south of the Nahr 'Isa, or Sakhlawieh [[canal]], the northernmost of the canals connecting that river with the [[Tigris]].{{sfn|Peters|1911}}

== History ==
Anbar was originally called '''Pērōz-Šāpūr''' or '''Pērōz-Šābuhr''' (from {{lang-pal|𐭯𐭥𐭩𐭥𐭦𐭱𐭧𐭯𐭥𐭧𐭥𐭩}}, meaning &quot;Victorious Shapur&quot;; in {{lang-xpr|𐭐𐭓𐭂𐭅𐭆𐭔𐭇𐭐𐭅𐭇𐭓}} ''prgwzšhypwhr''; in {{lang-arc|פירוז שבור}}), and became known as '''Perisapora''' or '''Pirisabora''' to the Greeks and Romans. The city was founded {{circa|350}} by the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian Persian]] king [[Shapur II]], and located in the Sassanid province of [[Asōristān]]. Perisapora was sacked and burned by Emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] in April 363, during [[Julian's Persian War|his invasion]] of the [[Sasanian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Bowersock, ''Julian the Apostate'', (Harvard University Press, 1978), 112.&lt;/ref&gt;  The town became a refuge for the Arab, Christian and Jewish colonies of that region.{{sfn|Peters|1911}} According to medieval Arabic sources, most of the inhabitants of the town migrated north to found the city of [[Hdatta]] south of [[Mosul]].&lt;ref name=EOI&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Lewis | first = Bernard | authorlink = Bernard Lewis | editor = Hertzfeld, E | encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia of Islam | isbn = 9789004081185 | title = Ḥadīt̲a  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=d9JSXwAACAAJ | accessdate = 12 October 2012 | edition = Second | year = 1986 | publisher = BRILL | volume = 3 | pages = 29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anbar was adjacent or identical to the [[History of the Jews in Iraq#Babylonia as the center of Judaism|Babylonian Jewish]] center of [[Nehardea]] ({{lang-arc|נהרדעא}}), and lies a short distance from the present-day town of [[Fallujah]], formerly the [[History of the Jews in Iraq#Babylonia as the center of Judaism|Babylonian Jewish]] center of [[Pumbedita]] ({{lang-arc|פומבדיתא}}).

The name of the town was then changed to ''Anbar'' ([[Middle Persian]] word for &quot;[[granaries]]&quot;). [[As-Saffah|Abu al-Abbas as-Saffah]], the founder of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], made it his capital, and such it remained until the founding of [[Baghdad]] in 762.
It continued to be a place of much importance throughout the Abbasid period.{{sfn|Peters|1911}}

== Ecclesiastical history ==
Anbar used to host an [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] community from the fifth century: the town was the seat of a bishopric of the [[Church of the East]]. The names of fourteen of its bishops of the period 486–1074 are known, three of whom became&lt;ref&gt;Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=86weAemI-e4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 1171-1174&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chaldean Patriarch of Babylon]].

No longer a residential bishopric, having faded.

=== Titular see ===
Anbar is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]] of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]],&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 832&lt;/ref&gt; established as [[titular bishop]]ric in 1980.

It has had the following incumbents, generally of the lowest (episcopal) rank, ''with a single archiepiscopal (intermediate) exception, the first :
* ''Titular Archbishop [[Stéphane Katchou]] (1980.10.03 – 1981.11.10), as [[Coadjutor Archeparch]] of [[Bassorah of the Chaldeans]] (Iraq) (1980.10.03 – 1981.11.10); later succeeded as Archeparch (Archbishop) of Bassorah of the Chaldeans (1981.11.10 – 1983.11.29), finally [[Archbishop-Bishop]] of [[Zaku of the Chaldeans]] (Iraq) (1983.11.29 – death 1987.11.08)
* Titular Bishop [[Ibrahim Namo Ibrahim]] (1982.01.11 – 1985.08.03), as [[Apostolic Exarch]] of [[United States of America of the Chaldeans]] (USA) (1982.01.11 – 1985.08.03); later restyled and promoted first Eparch (Bishop) of [[Saint Thomas the Apostle of Detroit of the Chaldeans]] (USA, the same) (1985.08.03 – 2014.05.03)
* Titular Bishop Shlemon Warduni (2001.01.12 – ...), [[Bishop of Curia]] of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]]

== Today ==
It is now entirely deserted, occupied only by mounds of ruins, whose great number indicate the city's former importance.{{sfn|Peters|1911}}
