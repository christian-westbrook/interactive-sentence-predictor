'''Alfonso IV''', called '''the Kind''' (also ''the Gentle'' or ''the Nice'', {{lang-ca|Alfons el Benigne}}) (2 November 1299 – 24 January 1336) was the [[King of Aragon]]&lt;ref&gt;O'Callaghan,  Joseph F.,''A History of Medieval Spain'', (Cornell University Press, 1975), 408.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Count of Barcelona]]&lt;ref&gt;''Medieval Iberia: an encyclopedia'', Ed. E. Michael Gerli, Samuel G. Armistead, (Routledge, 2003), 95.&lt;/ref&gt; (as Alfonso III) from 1327 to his death. He was born in [[Naples]], the second son of [[James II of Aragon|James II]] and [[Blanche of Anjou]]. His reign saw the incorporation of the [[County of Urgell]], [[Duchy of Athens]], and [[Duchy of Neopatria]] into the [[Crown of Aragon]].

During the reign of his father, he was the procurator general of the Crown. He married [[Teresa d'Entença y Cabrera]], heiress of [[Urgell]], in 1314 in the Cathedral of [[Lerida]]. He is reputed to have been so liberal in the expenses during the wedding, that the local counsels imposed restrictions on how much he could spend. In 1323–1324, he undertook the [[Aragonese conquest of Sardinia|conquest of Sardinia]]. He became heir after his older brother [[James of Aragon (monk)|James]] renounced his rights to become a monk. In 1329, he began a long war with the [[Republic of Genoa]]. The city of [[Sassari]] surrendered in 1323, but rebelled three more times and was contested by Genoa.

After being widowed in 1327, Alfonso married in February 1329 [[Eleanor of Castile (1307-1359)|Eleanor of Castile]] (1308–1359), who was betrothed to his brother James, who had refused to consummate the marriage. She was the sister of [[Alfonso XI of Castile]]. Because of some favoritism he showed towards his second wife, the last years of his life, he had to contend with the son of his first marriage, the future [[Peter IV of Aragon|Peter IV]].
