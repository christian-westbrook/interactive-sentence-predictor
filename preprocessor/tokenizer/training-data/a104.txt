'''Afroasiatic''' ('''Afro-Asiatic'''), also known as '''Afrasian''' and traditionally as '''Hamito-Semitic''' ('''Chamito-Semitic'''),&lt;ref name=&quot;Nanjira&quot;&gt;Daniel Don Nanjira, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LZuxGsXVPoMC&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false African Foreign Policy and Diplomacy: From Antiquity to the 21st Century]'', (ABC-CLIO: 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; is a large [[language family]] of several hundred related languages and dialects. It comprises about 300 or so living languages and dialects, according to the 2009 [[Ethnologue]] estimate.&lt;ref name=&quot;ethnologue.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=52-16 Ethnologue family tree for Afroasiatic languages]&lt;/ref&gt; It includes languages spoken predominantly in [[Western Asia|West Asia]], [[North Africa]], the [[Horn of Africa]], and parts of the [[Sahel]].

Afroasiatic languages have over 350 million native speakers, the fourth largest number of any language family (after [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] and [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics/family Summary by language family]&lt;/ref&gt; The phylum has six branches: [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Chadic languages|Chadic]], [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]], [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], [[Omotic languages|Omotic]] and [[Semitic languages|Semitic]].

By far the most widely spoken Afroasiatic language is [[Arabic]]. It is also the most widely spoken language within the Semitic branch, and includes [[Modern Standard Arabic]] and spoken [[Varieties of Arabic|colloquial varieties]]. Arabic has around 290 million native speakers, who are concentrated primarily in West Asia, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, and Malta.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ara&lt;/ref&gt;

Other widely spoken Afroasiatic languages include:&lt;!-- individual languages - descending order number of speakers --&gt;
* [[Hausa language|Hausa]] (Chadic branch), the dominant language of northern [[Nigeria]] and southern [[Niger]], spoken as a first language by 35 million people and used as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' by another 20 million across West Africa and the [[Sahel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ethnologue-hau&quot;&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=hau Ethnologue - Hausa]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Central Atlas Tamazight]] (Berber branch), spoken in [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Libya]], [[Tunisia]], northern [[Mali]], northern Niger, and [[Egypt]] by around 25 to 35 million people.
* [[Oromo language|Oromo]] (Cushitic branch), spoken in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Kenya]] by around 33 million people total.
* [[Amharic]] (Semitic branch), spoken in Ethiopia, with over 25 million native speakers in addition to millions of other Ethiopians speaking it as a second language.
* [[Somali language|Somali]] (Cushitic branch), spoken by 15 million people in [[Somalia]], [[Djibouti]], eastern [[Ethiopia]], and northeastern [[Kenya]].

In addition to languages spoken today, Afroasiatic includes several important ancient languages, such as [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]], [[Akkadian]], [[Biblical Hebrew]], and [[Old Aramaic language|Old Aramaic]]. It is uncertain when or where the original homeland of the Afroasiatic family existed. Proposed locations include North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Eastern Sahara, and the Levant.

==Etymology==
During the early 1800s, linguists grouped the [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] and [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] languages within a &quot;Hamitic&quot; phylum, in acknowledgement of these languages' genetic relation with each other and with those in the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] phylum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruhlen&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Merritt|first1=Ruhlen|title=A Guide to the World's Languages: Classification|date=1991|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=0804718946|pages=76 &amp; 87|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=mYwmDE3f6wUC&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms &quot;Hamitic&quot; and &quot;Semitic&quot; were etymologically derived from the [[Book of Genesis]], which describes various Biblical tribes descended from [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]] and [[Shem]], two sons of [[Noah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gregersen|first1=Edgar A.|title=Language in Africa: An Introductory Survey|date=1977|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0677043805|page=116|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=w4lytWv1JKAC&amp;pg=PA116#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1860s, the main constituent elements within the broader Afroasiatic family had been worked out.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruhlen&quot;/&gt;

The scholar [[Friedrich Müller (linguist)|Friedrich Müller]] introduced the name &quot;Hamito-Semitic&quot; for the entire family in his ''Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft'' (1876).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lipiński&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Lipiński|first=Edward|title=Semitic Languages: Outline of a Comparative Grammar|year=2001|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=90-429-0815-7|pages=21–22|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=IiXVqyEkPKcC&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maurice Delafosse]] (1914) later coined the term &quot;Afroasiatic&quot; (often now spelled &quot;Afro-Asiatic&quot;). However, it did not come into general use until [[Joseph Greenberg]] (1950) formally proposed its adoption. In doing so, Greenberg sought to emphasize the fact that Afroasiatic spanned the continents of both Africa and Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lipiński&quot; /&gt;

Individual scholars have also called the family &quot;Erythraean&quot; (Tucker 1966) and &quot;Lisramic&quot; (Hodge 1972). In lieu of &quot;Hamito-Semitic&quot;, the Russian linguist [[Igor Diakonoff]] later suggested the term &quot;Afrasian&quot;, meaning &quot;half African, half Asiatic&quot;, in reference to the geographic distribution of the family's constituent languages.&lt;ref name=NEB&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Encyclopædia Britannica, Volume 8; Volume 22|year=1998|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|isbn=0-85229-633-9|pages=722|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=6-lMAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;Hamito-Semitic&quot; remains in use in the academic traditions of some European countries.

==Distribution and branches==
[[File:Interrelations between branches of Afro-Asiatic.svg|thumb|300px|Interrelations between branches of Afroasiatic (Lipiński 2001).]]
[[File:afroasiatic.svg|thumb|right|300px|Some linguists' proposals for grouping within Afroasiatic.]]
The Afroasiatic language family is usually considered to include the following branches:
* [[Berber languages|Berber]]
* [[Chadic languages|Chadic]]
* [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]]
* [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]
* [[Omotic languages|Omotic]]
* [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]

Although there is general agreement on these six families, there are some points of disagreement among [[linguistics|linguists]] who study Afroasiatic. In particular:
* The [[Omotic]] language branch is the most controversial member of Afroasiatic, because the grammatical formatives that most linguists have given greatest weight in classifying languages in the family &quot;are either absent or distinctly wobbly&quot; (Hayward 1995). Greenberg (1963) and others considered it a subgroup of Cushitic, whereas others have raised doubts about it being part of Afroasiatic at all (e.g. Theil 2006).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sands2009&quot;&gt;Sands, Bonny (2009). &quot;Africa’s Linguistic Diversity&quot;. Language and Linguistics Compass 3/2 (2009): 559–580, 10.1111/j.1749-818x.2008.00124.x&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Afroasiatic identity of [[Ongota language|Ongota]] is also broadly questioned, as is its position within Afroasiatic among those who accept it, due to the &quot;mixed&quot; appearance of the language and a paucity of research and data. [[Harold C. Fleming|Harold Fleming]] (2006) proposes that Ongota constitutes a separate branch of Afroasiatic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/pcgi/a.cgi?ausgabe=index&amp;T=1235007315045{haupt_harrassowitz=http://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/title_3277.ahtml?T=1235007315045} Harrassowitz Verlag - The Harrassowitz Publishing House&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Bonny Sands (2009) believes the most convincing proposal is by Savà and Tosco (2003), namely that Ongota is an East Cushitic language with a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] [[substratum]]. In other words, it would appear that the Ongota people once spoke a Nilo-Saharan language but then shifted to speaking a Cushitic language but retained some characteristics of their earlier Nilo-Saharan language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sands2009&quot;/&gt;
* [[Beja language|Beja]] is sometimes listed as a separate branch of Afroasiatic but is more often included in the Cushitic branch, which has a high degree of internal diversity.
* Whether the various branches of Cushitic actually form a language family is sometimes questioned, but not their inclusion in Afroasiatic itself.
* There is no consensus on the interrelationships of the five non-Omotic branches of Afroasiatic (see [[# Subgrouping|§ Subgrouping]] below). This situation is not unusual, even among long-established language families: there are also many disagreements concerning the internal classification of the [[Indo-European languages]], for instance.
* [[Meroitic language|Meroitic]] has been proposed as an unclassified Afroasiatic language, because it shares the [[phonotactics]] characteristic of the family, but there is not enough evidence to secure a classification.

==Classification history==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Berber people]] --&gt;
In the 9th century, the Hebrew grammarian [[Judah ibn Kuraish|Judah ibn Quraysh]] of [[Tiaret]] in [[Algeria]] was the first to link two branches of Afroasiatic together; he perceived a relationship between Berber and Semitic. He knew of Semitic through his study of Arabic, Hebrew, and [[Aramaic]].

In the course of the 19th century, Europeans also began suggesting such relationships. In 1844, [[Theodor Benfey]] suggested a language family consisting of Semitic, Berber, and Cushitic (calling the latter &quot;Ethiopic&quot;). In the same year, T.N. Newman suggested a relationship between Semitic and Hausa, but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty.

[[Friedrich Müller (linguist)|Friedrich Müller]] named the traditional Hamito-Semitic family in 1876 in his ''Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft'' (&quot;Outline of Linguistics&quot;), and defined it as consisting of a Semitic group plus a &quot;Hamitic&quot; group containing Egyptian, Berber, and Cushitic; he excluded the Chadic group. It was the [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] [[Karl Richard Lepsius]] (1810&amp;ndash;1884) who restricted Hamitic to the non-Semitic languages in Africa, which are characterized by a grammatical [[Grammatical gender|gender system]]. This &quot;Hamitic language group&quot; was proposed to unite various, mainly North-African, languages, including the Ancient [[Egyptian language]], the [[Berber languages]], the [[Cushitic languages]], the [[Beja language]], and the [[Chadic languages]]. Unlike Müller, Lepsius considered that [[Hausa language|Hausa]] and [[Nama language|Nama]] were part of the Hamitic group. These classifications relied in part on non-linguistic anthropological and racial arguments. Both authors used the skin-color, mode of subsistence, and other characteristics of native speakers as part of their arguments that particular languages should be grouped together.&lt;ref name = &quot;mer&quot;&gt;Merritt Ruhlen, ''A Guide to the World's Languages: Classification'', Stanford University Press, 1991, pp. 80–1&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Africa ethnic groups 1996.jpg|thumb|Distribution of the Afroasiatic/Hamito-Semitic languages in Africa ([[Library of Congress]]).]]
In 1912, [[Carl Meinhof]] published ''Die Sprachen der Hamiten'' (&quot;The Languages of the Hamites&quot;), in which he expanded Lepsius's model, adding the [[Fula language|Fula]], [[Maasai language|Maasai]], [[Bari language|Bari]], [[Nandi languages|Nandi]], [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] and [[Hadza language|Hadza]] languages to the Hamitic group. Meinhof's model was widely supported into the 1940s.&lt;ref name = &quot;mer&quot;/&gt; Meinhof's system of classification of the Hamitic languages was based on a belief that &quot;speakers of Hamitic became largely coterminous with cattle herding peoples with essentially Caucasian origins, intrinsically different from and superior to the 'Negroes of Africa'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Shillington, ''Encyclopedia of African History'', CRC Press, 2005, p.797&lt;/ref&gt; But, in the case of the so-called [[Nilo-Hamitic languages]] (a concept he introduced), it was based on the typological feature of gender and a &quot;fallacious theory of [[mixed language|language mixture]].&quot; Meinhof did this although earlier work by scholars such as Lepsius and Johnston had substantiated that the languages which he would later dub &quot;Nilo-Hamitic&quot; were in fact Nilotic languages, with numerous similarities in vocabulary to other Nilotic languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruhlen109&quot;&gt;Merritt Ruhlen, ''A Guide to the World's Languages'', (Stanford University Press: 1991), p.109&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leo Reinisch]] (1909) had already proposed linking Cushitic and Chadic, while urging their more distant affinity with Egyptian and Semitic. However, his suggestion found little acceptance. [[Marcel Cohen]] (1924) rejected the idea of a distinct &quot;Hamitic&quot; subgroup, and included [[Hausa language|Hausa]] (a Chadic language) in his comparative Hamito-Semitic vocabulary. Finally, [[Joseph Greenberg]]'s 1950 work led to the widespread rejection of &quot;Hamitic&quot; as a language category by linguists. Greenberg refuted Meinhof's linguistic theories, and rejected the use of racial and social evidence. In dismissing the notion of a separate &quot;Nilo-Hamitic&quot; language category in particular, Greenberg was &quot;returning to a view widely held a half century earlier.&quot; He consequently rejoined Meinhof's so-called Nilo-Hamitic languages with their appropriate Nilotic siblings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruhlen&quot;/&gt; He also added (and sub-classified) the Chadic languages, and proposed the new name Afroasiatic for the family. Almost all scholars have accepted this classification as the new and continued consensus.

Greenberg's model was fully developed in his book ''[[The Languages of Africa]]'' (1963), in which he reassigned most of Meinhof's additions to Hamitic to other language families, notably [[Nilo-Saharan]]. Following [[Isaac Schapera]] and rejecting Meinhof, he classified the [[Hottentot language]] as a member of the Central [[Khoisan languages]]. To Khoisan he also added the Tanzanian [[Hadza language|Hadza]] and [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]], though this view remains controversial since some scholars consider these languages to be [[Language isolate|linguistic isolates]].&lt;ref&gt;Sands, Bonny E. (1998) 'Eastern and Southern African Khoisan: evaluating claims of distant linguistic relationships.' Quellen zur Khoisan-Forschung 14. Köln: Köppe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruhlen, p.117&quot;&gt;Ruhlen, p.117&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Greenberg's model remains the basis for modern classifications of languages spoken in Africa, and the Hamitic category (and its extension to Nilo-Hamitic) has no part in this.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruhlen, p.117&quot;/&gt;

Since the three traditional branches of the Hamitic languages (Berber, Cushitic and Egyptian) have not been shown to form an exclusive ([[Monophyly|monophyletic]]) phylogenetic unit of their own, separate from other Afroasiatic languages, linguists no longer use the term in this sense. Each of these branches is instead now regarded as an independent subgroup of the larger Afroasiatic family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Welmers&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Everett Welmers|first1=William|title=African Language Structures|date=1974|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520022106|page=16|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=hCxpK-CkdgYC&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, [[Harold C. Fleming|Harold Fleming]] proposed that what had previously been known as Western Cushitic is an independent branch of Afroasiatic, suggesting for it the new name [[Omotic languages|Omotic]]. This proposal and name have met with widespread acceptance.

Several scholars, including Harold Fleming and [[Robert Hetzron]], have since questioned the traditional inclusion of Beja in Cushitic.

''[[Glottolog]]'' does not accept that the inclusion or even unity of Omotic has been established, nor that of Ongota or the unclassified Kujarge. It therefore splits off the following groups as small families: [[South Omotic languages|South Omotic]], [[Mao languages|Mao]], [[Dizoid languages|Dizoid]], [[Gonga–Gimojan languages|Gonga–Gimojan]] (North Omotic apart from the preceding), [[Ongota language|Ongota]], [[Kujarge language|Kujarge]].

Little agreement exists on the [[subgrouping (linguistics)|subgrouping]] of the five or six branches of Afroasiatic: Semitic, Egyptian, Berber, Chadic, Cushitic, and Omotic. However, [[Christopher Ehret]] (1979), Harold Fleming (1981), and Joseph Greenberg (1981) all agree that the Omotic branch split from the rest first.

Otherwise:
* [[Paul Newman (linguist)|Paul Newman]] (1980) groups Berber with Chadic and Egyptian with Semitic, while questioning the inclusion of Omotic in Afroasiatic. Rolf Theil (2006) concurs with the exclusion of Omotic, but does not otherwise address the structure of the family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/iln/LING2110/v07/THEIL%20Is%20Omotic%20Afroasiatic.pdf Is Omotic Afroasiatic? (In Norwegian)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Harold Fleming (1981) divides non-Omotic Afroasiatic, or &quot;Erythraean&quot;, into three groups, Cushitic, Semitic, and Chadic-Berber-Egyptian. He later added Semitic and Beja to Chadic-Berber-Egyptian and tentatively proposed [[Ongota language|Ongota]] as a new third branch of Erythraean. He thus divided Afroasiatic into two major branches, Omotic and Erythraean, with Erythraean consisting of three sub-branches, Cushitic, Chadic-Berber-Egyptian-Semitic-Beja, and Ongota.
* Like Harold Fleming, [[Christopher Ehret]] (1995: 490) divides Afroasiatic into two branches, Omotic and Erythrean. He divides Omotic into two branches, North Omotic and South Omotic. He divides Erythrean into Cushitic, comprising Beja, Agaw, and East-South Cushitic, and North Erythrean, comprising Chadic and &quot;Boreafrasian.&quot; According to his classification, Boreafrasian consists of Egyptian, Berber, and Semitic.
* [[Vladimir Orel]] and Olga Stolbova (1995) group Berber with Semitic and Chadic with Egyptian. They split up Cushitic into five or more independent branches of Afroasiatic, viewing Cushitic as a [[Sprachbund]] rather than a [[language family]].
* [[Igor M. Diakonoff]] (1996) subdivides Afroasiatic in two, grouping Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic together as East-West Afrasian (ESA), and Chadic with Egyptian as North-South Afrasian (NSA). He excludes Omotic from Afroasiatic.
* [[Lionel Bender (linguist)|Lionel Bender]] (1997) groups Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic together as &quot;Macro-Cushitic&quot;. He regards Chadic and Omotic as the branches of Afroasiatic most remote from the others.
* Alexander Militarev (2000), on the basis of [[lexicostatistics]], groups Berber with Chadic and both more distantly with Semitic, as against Cushitic and Omotic. He places Ongota in South Omotic.

==Position among the world's languages==
Afroasiatic is one of the four major [[Languages of Africa|language families]] spoken in Africa identified by Joseph Greenberg in his book ''[[The Languages of Africa]]'' (1963). It is one of the few whose speech area is transcontinental, with languages from Afroasiatic's Semitic branch also spoken in the Middle East and Europe.

There are no generally accepted relations between Afroasiatic and any other language family. However, several proposals grouping Afroasiatic with one or more other language families have been made. The best-known of these are the following:
* [[Hermann Möller]] (1906) argued for a relation between [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and the [[Indo-European languages]]. This proposal was accepted by a few linguists (e.g. [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] and [[Louis Hjelmslev]]). (For a fuller account, see [[Indo-Semitic languages]].) However, the theory has little currency today, although most linguists do not deny the existence of grammatical similarities between both families (such as grammatical gender, noun-adjective agreement, three-way number distinction, and vowel alternation as a means of derivation).
* Apparently influenced by Möller (a colleague of his at the [[University of Copenhagen]]), [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] included Hamito-Semitic (the term replaced by Afroasiatic) in his proposed Nostratic macro-family (cf. Pedersen 1931:336–338), also included the Indo-European, [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Altaic languages|Altaic]], [[Yukaghir languages]], and [[Dravidian Languages]]. This inclusion was retained by subsequent Nostraticists, starting with [[Vladislav Illich-Svitych]] and [[Aharon Dolgopolsky]].
* [[Joseph Greenberg]] (2000–2002) did not reject a relationship of Afroasiatic to these other languages, but he considered it more distantly related to them than they were to each other, grouping instead these other languages in a separate macro-family, which he called [[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]], and to which he added [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotian]], [[Nivkh language|Gilyak]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Japonic languages|Japanese-Ryukyuan]], [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut]], and [[Ainu languages|Ainu]].
* Most recently, [[Sergei Anatolyevich Starostin|Sergei Starostin]]'s school has accepted Eurasiatic as a subgroup of Nostratic, with Afroasiatic, Dravidian and Kartvelian in Nostratic outside of Eurasiatic. The even larger Borean super-family contains Nostratic as well as [[Dené–Caucasian languages|Dené-Caucasian]] and [[Austric languages|Austric]].

==Date of Afroasiatic==
[[File:Assyriansample.ogg|thumb|right|180px|Speech sample in the Semitic [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Neo-Aramaic]] language, a descendant of [[Old Aramaic]].]]
The earliest written evidence of an Afroasiatic language is an [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] inscription dated to c. 3400 BC (5,400 years ago).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/9903/newsbriefs/egypt.html Earliest Egyptian Glyphs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Symbols on [[Gerzeh culture|Gerzean]] (Naqada II) pottery resembling [[Egyptian hieroglyphs#History and evolution|Egyptian hieroglyphs]] date back to c. 4000 BC, suggesting an earlier possible dating. This gives us a minimum date for the age of Afroasiatic. However, Ancient Egyptian is highly divergent from [[Proto-Afroasiatic language|Proto-Afroasiatic]] (Trombetti 1905: 1–2), and considerable time must have elapsed in between them. Estimates of the date at which the Proto-Afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely. They fall within a range between approximately 7,500 BC (9,500 years ago), and approximately 16,000 BC (18,000 years ago). According to [[Igor M. Diakonoff]] (1988: 33n), Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken [[circa|c.]] 10,000 BC. Christopher Ehret (2002: 35–36) asserts that Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c. 11,000 BC at the latest, and possibly as early as c. 16,000 BC. These dates are older than those associated with other [[proto-language]]s.

==Afroasiatic Urheimat==
{{main|Afroasiatic Urheimat}}
[[File:Expansion of Afroasiatic.svg|thumb|upright|Map showing one of the proposed Afroasiatic Urheimat.]]
The term Afroasiatic Urheimat (''Urheimat'' meaning &quot;original homeland&quot; in German) refers to the hypothetical place where [[Proto-Afroasiatic language]] speakers lived in a single linguistic community, or complex of communities, before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages. Afroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in [[Western Asia|West Asia]], [[North Africa]], the [[Horn of Africa]], and parts of the [[Sahel]]. Their distribution seems to have been influenced by the [[Sahara pump theory|Sahara pump]] operating over the last 10,000 years.

There is no agreement when or where the original homeland of this language family existed. Proposed locations include North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Eastern Sahara,&lt;ref name=blench2006&gt;Blench R (2006) Archaeology, Language, and the African Past, Rowman Altamira, {{ISBN|0-7591-0466-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7591-0466-2}}, https://books.google.com/books?id=esFy3Po57A8C&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ehret2004&gt;Ehret C, Keita SOY, Newman P (2004) The Origins of Afroasiatic a response to Diamond and Bellwood (2003) in the Letters of SCIENCE 306, no. 5702, p. 1680 {{doi|10.1126/science.306.5702.1680c}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bernal1987&gt;Bernal M (1987) Black Athena: the Afroasiatic roots of classical civilization, Rutgers University Press, {{ISBN|0-8135-3655-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8135-3655-2}}. https://books.google.com/books?id=yFLm_M_OdK4C&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bender1997&gt;Bender ML (1997), Upside Down Afrasian, Afrikanistische Arbeitspapiere 50, pp. 19-34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=militarev2005&gt;Militarev A (2005) [http://starling.rinet.ru/Texts/fleming.pdf Once more about glottochronology and comparative method: the Omotic-Afrasian case, Аспекты компаративистики - 1 (Aspects of comparative linguistics - 1)].

Widespread (though not universal) features of the Afroasiatic languages include:
* A set of [[emphatic consonant]]s, variously realized as glottalized, pharyngealized, or implosive.
* [[Verb–subject–object|VSO]] [[linguistic typology|typology]] with [[subject–verb–object|SVO]] tendencies.
* A two-[[grammatical gender|gender]] system in the singular, with the feminine marked by the sound /t/.
* All Afroasiatic subfamilies show evidence of a [[causative]] affix ''s''.
* Semitic, Berber, Cushitic (including Beja), and Chadic support [[possessive suffix]]es.
* [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]] in which words inflect by changes within the root (vowel changes or [[gemination]]) as well as with prefixes and suffixes.

One of the most remarkable shared features among the Afroasiatic languages is the prefixing verb conjugation (see the table at the start of this section), with a distinctive pattern of prefixes beginning with /ʔ t n y/, and in particular a pattern whereby third-singular masculine /y-/ is opposed to third-singular feminine and second-singular /t-/.

According to Ehret (1996), [[tonal language]]s appear in the Omotic and Chadic branches of Afroasiatic, as well as in certain Cushitic languages. The Semitic, Berber and Egyptian branches generally do not use tones [[phoneme|phonemically]].
