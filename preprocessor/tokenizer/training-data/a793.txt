'''Afonso VI''' ({{IPA-pt|ɐˈfõsu}}; English: ''Alphonzo'' or ''Alphonse'', Old Portuguese: ''Affonso''; 21 August 1643{{snd}}12 September 1683), known as &quot;the Victorious&quot; ({{lang|pt|''o Vitorioso''}}), was the second [[list of Portuguese monarchs|King of Portugal]] and the [[Kingdom of the Algarve|Algarves]] of the [[House of Braganza]] from 1656 until his death. He was initially under the regency of his mother, [[Luisa of Medina-Sidonia]], until 1662, when he removed her to a convent and took power with the help of his favourite, the [[Luís de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 3rd Count of Castelo Melhor|Count of Castelo Melhor]].

Afonso's reign saw the end of the [[Portuguese Restoration War|Restoration War]] (1640–68) and Spain's recognition of Portugal's independence. He also negotiated a French alliance through his marriage. However, the king was physically and mentally weak. In 1668, his brother [[Peter II of Portugal|Pedro]] conspired to have him declared incapable of ruling and took power as regent. His French wife, Queen [[Maria Francisca of Savoy|Marie Françoise]], received an annulment and married Pedro. Afonso spent the rest of his life and reign practically a prisoner.

== Early life ==
At the age of three, Afonso suffered an illness that left him paralyzed on the left side of his body, also leaving him mentally unstable. His father created him 10th [[Duke of Braganza]].

After the death of his eldest brother [[Teodósio, Prince of Brazil]] in 1653, Afonso became the [[heir apparent]] to the throne of the kingdom. He received also the crown-princely title 2nd [[Prince of Brazil]].

== Succession ==

He succeeded his father ([[João IV]]) in 1656 at the age of thirteen. His mother, [[Luisa of Medina-Sidonia]], was named regent in his father's will. His mental instability and paralysis, plus his lack of interest in government, left his mother as regent for six years, until 1662.  Afonso oversaw decisive military victories over the Spanish at [[Battle of the Lines of Elvas|Elvas]] (14 January 1659), [[Battle of Ameixial|Ameixial]] (8 June 1663) and [[Battle of Montes Claros|Montes Claros]] (17 June 1665), culminating in the final Spanish recognition of sovereignty of Portugal's new ruling dynasty, the [[House of Braganza]], on 13 February 1668 in the [[Treaty of Lisbon (1668)|Treaty of Lisbon]].

== Colonial affairs ==
Colonial affairs saw the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] conquest of [[Jaffna]]patam, Portugal's last colony in [[Portuguese Ceylon]] (1658) and the cession of [[Bombay]] and [[Tangier]] to England (23 June 1661) as dowry for Afonso's sister, [[Catherine of Braganza]], who had married King [[Charles II of England]]. English mediation in 1661 saw the Netherlands acknowledge Portuguese rule of [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]] in return for uncontested control of [[Ceylon]].

In 1662, the [[Luís de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 3rd Count of Castelo Melhor|Count of Castelo Melhor]] saw an opportunity to gain power at court by befriending the king. He managed to convince the king that his mother was out to steal his throne and exile her in Portugal. As a result, Afonso took control of the throne and his mother was sent to a convent.

== Marriage ==
He married [[Marie Françoise of Nemours]], the daughter of the [[Duke of Savoy]] in 1666, but the marriage was short-lived. Marie Françoise, or Maria Francisca in Portuguese, filed for an annulment in 1667 based on the impotence of the king. The Church granted her the annulment, and she married Afonso's brother, Pedro, [[Duke of Beja]] (the future [[Peter II of Portugal|Peter II]]).

== Deposition ==

That same year, Pedro managed to gain enough support to force the king to relinquish control of the government and he became Prince Regent in 1668. Afonso was exiled to the island of [[Terceira]] in the [[Azores]] for seven years, returning to mainland Portugal shortly before he died at [[Sintra]] in 1683.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Alphonso|display=Alphonso s.v. Alphonso VI.|volume=1|page=734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His trial{{Clarify|pre-text=which trial?|date=August 2010}} is the basis of [[João Mário Grilo]]'s 1990 film, ''The King's Trial'' (''O Processo do Rei'').
