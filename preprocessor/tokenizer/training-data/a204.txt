The '''American Revolutionary War''' (1775{{ndash}}1783), also known as the '''American War of Independence''',&lt;ref&gt;Modern British writers generally favor &quot;American War of Independence&quot;, rather than &quot;American Rebellion&quot; or &quot;War of American Independence&quot;. {{cite web|url= https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-history-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-history-programmes-of-study|title= National Curriculum England|date= |accessdate= April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a global war that began as a conflict between [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and her [[Thirteen Colonies]], which declared independence as the [[United States|United States of America]].{{refn|This article primarily refers to the inhabitants of the thirteen colonies who supported the American Revolution as &quot;Americans&quot;, with occasional references to &quot;Patriots&quot; or &quot;Revolutionaries&quot;. Colonists who supported the British and opposed the Revolution are referred to as &quot;Loyalists&quot; or &quot;Tories&quot;. The geographical area of the thirteen colonies is often referred to simply as &quot;America&quot;.|group=N}}

After 1765, growing [[American Revolution#Origin|philosophical and political differences]] strained the relationship between Great Britain and its colonies. Following the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]], [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] protests against [[No taxation without representation|taxation without representation]] escalated into boycotts, which culminated in the [[Sons of Liberty]] [[Boston Tea Party|destroying a shipment of tea]] in Boston Harbor. Britain responded by closing Boston Harbor and passing a series of [[Intolerable Acts|punitive measures]] against Massachusetts colony. [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts colonists]] responded with the [[Suffolk Resolves]], and they established a shadow government which wrested control of the countryside from the Crown. Twelve colonies formed a [[Continental Congress]] to coordinate their resistance, establishing committees and conventions that effectively seized power.&lt;ref&gt;The colony of Georgia joined later.&lt;/ref&gt;

British attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia at [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] in April 1775 [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|led to open combat]]. Militia forces then [[Siege of Boston|besieged Boston]], forcing a British evacuation in March 1776, and Congress appointed [[George Washington]] to command the [[Continental Army]]. Concurrently, an American attempt to [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|invade Quebec and raise rebellion]] against the British [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|decisively failed]]. On July 2, 1776, the Continental Congress voted for independence, issuing its [[United States Declaration of Independence|declaration]] on July&amp;nbsp;4. [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|Sir William Howe]] launched a [[New York and New Jersey campaign|British counter-offensive]], capturing New York City and leaving American morale at a low ebb. However, victories at [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]] restored American confidence. In 1777, the British launched an [[Saratoga Campaign|invasion from Quebec]] under [[John Burgoyne]], intending to isolate [[New England Colonies|New England]]. Instead of assisting this effort, Howe took his army on a separate [[Philadelphia campaign|campaign]] against Philadelphia, and Burgoyne was decisively defeated at [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] in October 1777.

Burgoyne's defeat had drastic consequences; France formally [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|allied with the Americans]] and [[France in the American Revolutionary War|entered the war]] in 1778, and Spain [[Spain in the American Revolutionary War|joined the war]] the following year as an [[Pacte de Famille|ally of France]] but not as an ally of the United States. In 1780, the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] [[Second Anglo-Mysore War|attacked the British in India]], and tensions between Great Britain and the Netherlands erupted into [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War|open war]]. In North America, the British mounted a &quot;[[Southern theatre of the American Revolutionary War|Southern strategy]]&quot; led by [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]] which hinged upon a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist uprising]], but too few came forward. Cornwallis suffered reversals at [[Battle of Kings Mountain|King's Mountain]] and [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]]. He retreated to Yorktown, Virginia, intending an evacuation, but a decisive [[Battle of the Chesapeake|French naval victory]] deprived him of an escape.

Colonial wars were also a contributing factor.

=== Taxation disputes ===

Britain triumphed over France and Spain in the [[Seven Years' War]], but this led to a financial crisis, as the national debt had doubled to £130 million, and the annual cost of the British civil and military establishment in America had quintupled when compared to 1749.&lt;ref&gt;Debt &amp; Taxes, John Makim &amp; Norman Ornstein P.54&lt;/ref&gt; Smuggling had been tacitly accepted, but now the British began to consider that it blunted their revenue, so Whitehall decided to ensure that customs duties were unavoidable&lt;ref&gt;Spain &amp; the Independence of the United States; An Intrinsic Gift. Thomas E, Chavez P.22&lt;/ref&gt; by passing the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] in 1765. Colonists condemned the tax because their [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]] protected them from being taxed by a Parliament in which they had [[no taxation without representation|no elected representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gladney, Henry M. |title=No Taxation without Representation: 1768 Petition, Memorial, and Remonstrance |year=2014 |url=http://www.hgladney.com/PMR/No_Taxation_without_Representation_(book_description).pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513135503/http://www.hgladney.com/PMR/No_Taxation_without_Representation_%28book_description%29.pdf |archive-date=May 13, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament argued that the colonies were &quot;[[Virtual representation|represented virtually]]&quot;, an idea that was criticized throughout the Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;google1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YKYOAAAAQAAJ|title=Liberty and Property: Political Ideology in Eighteenth-century Britain – H.

Enforcing the acts proved difficult; the seizure of the sloop ''[[HMS Liberty (1768)|Liberty]]'' on suspicions of smuggling triggered a riot. In response, British troops occupied Boston, and Parliament threatened to [[Treason Act 1543|extradite colonists]] to face trial in England.&lt;ref&gt;Knollenberg, Growth, 69&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions rose after the murder of a [[Christopher Seider|teen by a customs official]] in 1770 and escalated into outrage after British troops fired on civilians in the [[Boston Massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What was the Boston Massacre?|website=Boston Massacre Society|url=http://www.bostonmassacre.net/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1772, colonists in [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] boarded and burned a [[Gaspee Affair|customs schooner]]. Parliament then repealed all taxes except the one on tea, passing the [[Tea Act]] in 1773, attempting to force colonists to buy [[East India Company]] tea on which the Townshend duties were paid, thus implicitly agreeing to Parliamentary supremacy. The landing of the tea was resisted in all colonies, but the [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|governor of Massachusetts]] permitted British tea ships to remain in [[Boston Harbor]]—so the [[Sons of Liberty]] [[Boston Tea Party|destroyed the tea]] chests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boston Tea Party|website=History.com.|accessdate=|url=http://www.history.com/topics/american-revolution/boston-tea-party}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parliament then passed punitive legislation. It [[Boston Port Act|closed Boston Harbor]] until the tea was paid for and [[Massachusetts Government Act|revoked]] the [[Massachusetts Charter]], taking upon themselves the right to directly appoint the [[Massachusetts Governor's Council]]. Additionally, the royal governor was granted powers to undermine local democracy.&lt;ref&gt;http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/mass_gov_act.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian R.

=== Colonial response ===

The colonists responded by establishing the [[Massachusetts Provincial Congress]], effectively removing Crown control of the colony outside Boston. Meanwhile, representatives from twelve colonies{{refn|Georgia did not attend}}&lt;ref&gt;Ferling, John. (2003). A Leap in the Dark. Oxford University Press. p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; convened the [[First Continental Congress]] to respond to the crisis. The Congress narrowly rejected a proposal which would have created an [[Galloway's Plan of Union|American parliament]] to act in concert with the British Parliament; instead, they passed [[Continental Association|a compact]] declaring a [[Economic sanctions|trade boycott]] against Britain.&lt;ref name=Kindig&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kindig |first1=Thomas E. |title=Galloway's Plan for the Union of Great Britain and the Colonies |url=http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/related/planforunion.htm |website=Declaration of Independence |publisher=[[Independence Hall Association]], publishing electronically as ushistory.org. |accessdate=March 14, 2015 |location=[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], USA |date=1995 |quote=The plan was considered very attractive to most of the members, as it proposed a popularly elected Grand Council which would represent the interests of the colonies as a whole, and would be a continental equivalent to the English Parliament.

That the foundation of English liberty, and of all free government, is a right in the people to participate in their legislative council: and as the English colonists are not represented, and from their local and other circumstances, cannot properly be represented in the British parliament, they are entitled to a free and exclusive power of legislation in their several provincial legislatures, where their right of representation can alone be preserved, in all cases of taxation and internal polity, subject only to the negative of their sovereign, in such manner as has been heretofore used and accustomed: But, from the necessity of the case, and a regard to the mutual interest of both countries, we cheerfully consent to the operation of such acts of the British parliament, as are bonfide, restrained to the regulation of our external commerce, for the purpose of securing the commercial advantages of the whole empire to the mother country, and the commercial benefits of its respective members; excluding every idea of taxation internal or external, for raising a revenue on the subjects, in America, without their consent.&quot; quoted from the [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/resolves.asp Declarations and Resolves of the First Continental Congress] October 14, 1774.&lt;/ref&gt; and they authorized committees and conventions to enforce the boycott. The boycott was effective, as imports from Britain dropped by 97% in 1775 compared to 1774.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kramnick, Isaac 1982 p. 21&quot;/&gt;

Parliament refused to yield. In 1775, it declared Massachusetts to be in a state of rebellion and enforced a blockade of the colony.&lt;ref&gt;Cogliano, Francis D.

Routledge, 1999. pp. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cogliano, Revolutionary America, 47–48&lt;/ref&gt; It then passed [[Restraining Acts 1775|legislation to limit]] colonial trade to the British West Indies and the British Isles. Colonial ships were barred from the Newfoundland cod fisheries, a measure which pleased [[Canadiens]] but damaged New England's economy.

Cornwallis had discovered that the majority of the American's supplies in the Carolinas were passing through [[Virginia]], and had written to both Lord Germain and Clinton detailing his intentions to invade.

In March 1781, French Admiral [[Bailli de Suffren]] was dispatched to India to assist colonial efforts.

There was no clear victor, though Hughes' fleet came off worse,&lt;ref&gt;Castex (p. 315) calls this a French victory, on account of more severe damage to Hughes' fleet. Mahan (p. 566) does not explicitly designate a victor.&lt;/ref&gt; and he withdrew to the British-held port of Trincomalee. Hyder Ali wished for the French to capture Negapatam to establish naval dominance over the British, and this task fell to Suffren.

Following the surrender at Yorktown, the Whig party came to power in Britain and began opening negotiations for a cessation of hostilities. While peace negotiations were being undertaken, British troops in America were restricted from launching further offensives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greene, p. 325&quot;/&gt; Prime Minister the Earl of Shelburne was reluctant to accept American independence as a prerequisite for peace, as the British were aware that the French economy was nearly bankrupt, and reinforcements sent to the West Indies could potentially reverse the situation there.

The Americans initially demanded that Quebec be ceded to them as [[Prize of war|spoils of war]],&lt;ref&gt;Rideau, Roger. A Brief History of Canada. Facts on File. p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; a proposal that was dropped when Shelburne accepted American demands for recognition of independence.

=== Casualties and losses ===

==== Americans and allies ====
The total loss of life throughout the conflict is largely unknown. As was typical in wars of the era, diseases such as [[smallpox]] claimed more lives than battle. Between 1775 and 1782, a [[North American smallpox epidemic|smallpox epidemic]] broke out throughout North America, killing 40 people in Boston alone. Historian [[Joseph Ellis]] suggests that Washington's decision to have his troops [[inoculation|inoculated]] against the disease was one of his most important decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis (2004), p.&amp;nbsp;87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 25,000 and 70,000 American Patriots died during active military service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard H. Peckham 1974&quot;/&gt; Of these, approximately 6,800 were killed in battle, while at least 17,000 died from disease. The majority of the latter died while [[prisoners of war]] of the British, mostly in the [[Prisoners in the American Revolutionary War|prison ships]] in New York Harbor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burrows&quot; /&gt; If the upper limit of 70,000 is accepted as the total net loss for the Patriots, it would make the conflict proportionally deadlier than the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=medical /&gt; Uncertainty arises due to the difficulties in accurately calculating the number of those who succumbed to disease, as it is estimated at least 10,000 died in 1776 alone.&lt;ref name=medical /&gt; The number of Patriots seriously wounded or disabled by the war has been estimated from 8,500 to 25,000.&lt;ref&gt;American dead and wounded: Shy, pp.&amp;nbsp;249–50. The lower figure for number of wounded comes from Chambers, p.&amp;nbsp;849.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French suffered approximately 7,000 total dead throughout the conflict; of those, 2,112 were killed in combat in the American theaters of war.&lt;ref name=&quot;frenchcasualtiesrevolution&quot; /&gt;

The Dutch suffered around 500 total killed, owing to the minor scale of their conflict with Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Necrometrics&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://necrometrics.com/wars18c.htm#AmRev |title= Spanish casualties in The American Revolutionary war. |publisher= Necrometrics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 171,000 [[sailors]] served in the [[Royal Navy]] during the war; approximately a quarter of whom had been [[impressment|pressed]] into service. Around 1,240 were killed in battle, while an estimated 18,500 died from disease (1776–1780).&lt;ref name=&quot;Parliamentary Register&quot; /&gt; The greatest killer at sea was [[scurvy]], a disease caused by [[vitamin C]] deficiency.&lt;ref name=GARD2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Scurvy|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10406/scurvy|website=GARD|accessdate=26 September 2016|date=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1795 that scurvy was eradicated from the Royal Navy after the Admiralty declared [[lemon juice]] and [[sugar]] were to be issued among the standard daily rations of sailors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vale, Brian 2008&quot;&gt;Vale, Brian (2008). &quot;The Conquest of Scurvy in the Royal Navy 1793–1800: a Challenge to Current Orthodoxy&quot;.

Congress had immense difficulties throughout the conflict to efficiently finance the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis P. Nettels, The Emergence of a National Economy, 1775–1815 (1962) pp 23–44&lt;/ref&gt; As the circulation of hard currency declined, the Americans had to rely on loans from American merchants and bankers, France, Spain and the Netherlands, saddling the young nation with crippling debts. Congress attempted to remedy this by printing vast amounts of paper money and bills of credit to raise revenue. The effect was disastrous; inflation skyrocketed, and the paper money became virtually worthless. The inflation spawned a popular phrase that anything of little value was &quot;not worth a [[continental dollar|continental]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://myloc.gov/Exhibitions/creatingtheus/Constitution/RoadtotheConstitution/ExhibitObjects/NotWorthAContinental.aspx Not worth a continental]&quot;, &quot;Creating the United States&quot;, Library of Congress.

Parliament suffered chronic difficulties in obtaining sufficient manpower,&lt;ref&gt;War Office Papers, Manuscripts in the Public Record Office, 1:992–1008, passim&lt;/ref&gt; and found it impossible to fill the quotas they had set.&lt;ref&gt;War Officer Papers, 4:275, Jenkinson to Clinton, 5 Dec. 1780&lt;/ref&gt; The Army was a deeply unpopular profession, one contentious issue being pay.

To entice people to enrol, Parliament offered a [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] of [[guinea (coin)|£]]1.10[[shillings|s]] for every recruit.&lt;ref&gt;War Office Papers, 3:5, Harvey to Elliot, 10 March 1775&lt;/ref&gt; As the war dragged on, Parliament became desperate for manpower; criminals were offered military service to escape legal penalties, and deserters were pardoned if they re-joined their units.&lt;ref&gt;Clode, Volume II, p.13-14&lt;/ref&gt; After the defeat at Saratoga, Parliament doubled the bounty to £3,&lt;ref&gt;Statutes at Large, Ruffhead's Edition (London, 1763–1800), Volume XIII, p. 273-280&lt;/ref&gt; and increased it again the following year, to £3.3s, as well as expanding the age limit from 17–45 to 16–50 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;Statutes at Large, Ruffhead's Edition, Volume XIII, p. 316-317&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Impressment]], essentially conscription by the &quot;press gang&quot;, was a favored recruiting method, though it was unpopular with the public, leading many to enlist in local militias to avoid regular service.&lt;ref&gt;War Office Papers, 4:966, Jenkinson to John Livesey and E.

Hanover supplied 2,365 men in five [[battalions]], however, the lease agreement permitted them to only be used in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Knesebeck, Ernst von dem (1845), &quot;Geschichte de churhannoverschen Truppen in Gibraltar, Menorca und Ostindien&quot;, Published by Im Verlage der Helwingschen Hof-Buchhandlung.

===== Leadership =====

Britain had a difficult time appointing a determined senior military leadership in America. Thomas Gage, Commander-in-Chief of North America at the outbreak of the war, was criticized for being too lenient on the rebellious colonists. Jeffrey Amherst, who was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in 1778, refused a direct command in America, due to unwillingness to take sides in the war.&lt;ref&gt;Ketchum (1997), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Admiral [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Augustus Keppel]] similarly opposed a command, stating; &quot;I cannot draw the sword in such a cause&quot;. The [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Earl of Effingham|Earl of Effingham]] resigned his commission when his regiment was posted to America, while William Howe and John Burgoyne were opposed to military solutions to the crisis. Howe and Henry Clinton both stated they were unwilling participants, and were only following orders.&lt;ref&gt;Ketchum (1997), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

As was the case in many European armies, except the [[Prussian Army]], officers in British service could [[Purchase of commissions in the British Army|purchase commissions]] to ascend the ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, Christopher. The Military Experience in the Age of Reason. p. 61. {{ISBN|1-85326-690-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite repeated attempts by Parliament to suppress it, the practise was common in the Army.&lt;ref&gt;Forteseue, The British Army, 1783–1802, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Values of commissions varied, but were usually in line with social and military prestige, for example, regiments such as the [[Household Division#United Kingdom|Guards]] commanded the highest prices.&lt;ref name=cwsite&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colonialwargaming.co.uk/Miscellany/Army/Commissions.htm |title=The Purchase of Officers' Commissions in the British Army |first=John |last=Armatys |first2=Robert George |last2=Cordery |publisher=Colonial Wargames |year=2005 |accessdate=10 June 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120728105921/http://www.colonialwargaming.co.uk/Miscellany/Army/Commissions.htm|archivedate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower ranks often regarded the treatment to high-ranking commissions by wealthier officers as &quot;plums for [their] consumption&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Belcher, Volume I, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; Wealthy individuals lacking any formal military education, or practical experience, often found their way into positions of high responsibility, diluting the effectiveness of a regiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Lanning|title=American Revolution 100: The Battles, People, and Events of the American War for Independence, Ranked by Their Significance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1GEs53wMr7EC&amp;pg=PA193|year=2009|publisher=Sourcebooks|pages=193–96|isbn=9781402241703}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Royal authority had forbade the practise since 1711, it was still permitted for infants to hold commissions. Young boys, often orphans of deceased wealthy officers, were taken from their schooling and placed in positions of responsibility within regiments.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Volume II, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Logistics =====

Logistical organization of eighteenth century armies was chaotic at best, and the British Army was no exception. No logistical corps existed in the modern sense; while on campaign in foreign territories such as America, horses, wagons, and drivers were frequently requisitioned from the locals, often by impressment or by hire.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Francis (1879). &quot;History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery&quot;, Volume 1. J. Murray, p. 131, 303, 309&lt;/ref&gt; No centrally organized medical corps existed. It was common for surgeons to have no formal medical education, and no diploma or entry examination was required. Nurses sometimes were apprentices to surgeons, but many were drafted from the women who [[camp follower|followed the army]].&lt;ref&gt;Sergeant Lamb, &quot;Journal of the American War&quot;, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Army surgeons and doctors were poorly paid and were regarded as social inferiors to other officers.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, Volume 2, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Officer and Serjeant of a Highland Regiment.jpg|thumb|left|Soldiers of the [[42nd Regiment of Foot|Black Watch]] armed with [[Brown Bess]] muskets, c. 1790.]]
[[File:Grenadier, 40th Foot, 1767.jpg|thumb|right|Grenadier of the [[40th Regiment of Foot]] in 1767, armed with a Brown Bess musket.]]

The heavy personal equipment and wool uniform of the regular infantrymen were wholly unsuitable for combat in America, and the outfit was especially ill-suited to comfort and agile movement.&lt;ref&gt;Burgoyne, State of the Expedition, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Battle of Monmouth]] in late June 1778, the temperature exceeded 100°[[Fahrenheit|F]] (37.8°[[Celsius|C]]) and is said to have claimed more lives through [[heat stroke]] than through actual combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Battle of Monmouth Courthouse|url=http://www.robinsonlibrary.com/america/unitedstates/1775/campaigns/monmouth.htm|website=Robinson Library|publisher=Self-published|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard-issue firearm of the British Army was the [[Brown Bess|Land Pattern Musket]]. Some officers preferred their troops to fire careful, measured shots (around two per minute), rather than rapid firing. A bayonet made firing difficult, as its cumbersome shape hampered ramming down the charge into the barrel.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, Ernest Marsh (1908), Review of the History of Infantry, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; British troops had a tendency to fire impetuously, resulting in inaccurate fire, a trait for which John Burgoyne criticized them during the Saratoga campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, William, Orderly Book, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Burgoyne instead encouraged bayonet charges to break up enemy formations,&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Orderly Book, 20 June 1777, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; which was a preferred tactic in most European armies at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan, Volume III, p. 6; Volume IV, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Every battalion in America had organized its own rifle company by the end of the war, although rifles were not formally issued to the army until the [[Baker Rifle]] in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue, The British Army, 1783–1802, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Flintlocks were heavily dependent on the weather; high winds could blow the gunpowder from the [[flash pan]],&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, Charles Winthrop (1910), &quot;Firearms in American History&quot;, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; while heavy rain could soak the [[paper cartridge]], ruining the powder and rendering the musket unable to fire.&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan, Volume IV, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, flints used in British muskets were of notoriously poor quality; they could only be fired around six times before requiring resharpening, while American flints could fire sixty. This led to a common expression among the British: &quot;Yankee flint was as good as a glass of grog&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan, Volume IV, p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

Provisioning troops and sailors proved to be an immense challenge, as the majority of food stores had to be shipped overseas from Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Minute Book of a Board of General Officers of the British Army in New York, 1781. New York Historical Society Collections, 1916, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The need to maintain Loyalist support prevented the Army from living off the land.&lt;ref&gt;Black (2001), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors also impeded this option; the countryside was too sparsely populated and the inhabitants were largely hostile or indifferent, the network of roads and bridges was poorly developed, and the area which the British controlled was so limited that foraging parties were frequently in danger of being ambushed.&lt;ref&gt;Correspondence of George III with Lord North, Volume II, p. 7, 52&lt;/ref&gt; After France entered the war, the threat of the French navy increased the difficulty of transporting supplies to America. The food that could be bought in America was purchased at vastly inflated prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minute Book 1916, p. 81&quot;&gt;Minute Book (1916), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers stationed in the West Indies perhaps suffered the worst; the garrison commander of Tobago, Barbados, and [[Antigua]] frequently complained of the near-total lack of regular supply from Britain, and the food that could be bought was so expensive that the pay of the troops was inadequate to cover the costs.&lt;ref&gt;War Office Papers, Manuscripts in the Public Record Office, 1:51, Graham to Jenkinson, 13 September and 23 November 1779; 1:51, Vaughan to Jenkinson, 2 November 1780&lt;/ref&gt;

Food supplies were frequently in terrible condition, infested with mould, [[weevils]], worms, and maggots.&lt;ref&gt;Treasury Papers, Manuscripts in the Public Record Office, 64:118, Chamier to Robinson, 9 Nov 1776&lt;/ref&gt; Provisions were frequently destroyed by rats,&lt;ref&gt;Treasury Papers, 64:103, Day to Robinson, 22 Aug. 1777&lt;/ref&gt; and their containers were too fragile to sustain a long ocean voyage or the rigors of campaigning.&lt;ref&gt;Treasury Papers, 64:200, Marsh to Navy Board, 17 Dec 1779&lt;/ref&gt; The climate was also against the British in the southern colonies and the Caribbean, where the intense summer heat caused food supplies to sour and spoil.&lt;ref&gt;Treasury Papers, 64:120, Paumier to Robinson, 20 June &amp; 7 August 1779&lt;/ref&gt; British troops stationed in America were often on the verge of starvation.&lt;ref&gt;Treasury Papers, Manuscripts in the Public Record Office, 64:201, Wier to Robinson, 14 September 1780&lt;/ref&gt;

Life at sea was little better. Sailors and passengers were issued a daily food ration, largely consisting of [[hardtack]] and beer.&lt;ref name=RoyNavyMus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheet_ship_biscuit.htm |title=Ships Biscuits – Royal Navy hardtack |publisher=Royal Navy Museum |accessdate=2010-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091031064002/http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheet_ship_biscuit.htm |archivedate=October 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hardtack was often infested by weevils and was so tough that it earned the nicknames &quot;molar breakers&quot; and &quot;worm castles&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.19thusregulars.com/html/hardtack.html |title=19th United States Infantry |publisher=19thusregulars.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-25|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120715204518/http://www.19thusregulars.com/html/hardtack.html|archivedate=July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it sometimes had to be broken up with cannon shot.

===== Discipline =====

[[File:Whipping of an incarcerated delinquent, Germany 17th century.jpg|thumb|right|Flogging of a delinquent in [[Germany]], 17th century]]

Discipline in the armed forces was harsh, and [[Flagellation|the lash]] was used to punish even trivial offences, nor was it applied sparingly.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, (Sir) William, Orderly Book, edited by B. F. Stevens (London, 1890), pp. 263, 288&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, during the Saratoga campaign, two redcoats received 1,000 lashes each for robbery,&lt;ref&gt;Burgoyne, John, Orderly Book, edited by E. B. O'Callaghan (Albany, 1860), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; while another received 800 lashes for striking a superior officer.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Orderly Book, pp 263, 288&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], one soldier received 700 lashes for stealing a beehive, while another, whom had received only 175 strikes of his 400-lash sentence, spent three weeks in hospital from his injuries.&lt;ref&gt;Oman, Charles. Wellington's Army, 1809–1814. London: Greenhill, (1913) 1993. {{ISBN|0-947898-41-7}}, p. 246, 254&lt;/ref&gt; The practise could often be a contentious source of resentment; during the [[Battle of Quatre Bras]] in 1815, the commander of the [[92nd (Gordon Highlanders) Regiment of Foot|92nd Foot]] was shot and killed by a soldier whom he had recently flogged.&lt;ref&gt;Regan, G. (2004). More Military Blunders. Carlton Books. {{ISBN|1-84442-710-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Flogging was a common punishment in the Royal Navy, and came to be associated with the stereotypical hardiness of sailors.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.rmg.co.uk/explore/sea-and-ships/facts/ships-and-seafarers/life-at-sea-in-the-age-of-sail Life at sea in the age of sail]&quot;. National Maritime Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the harsh discipline, a distinct lack of self-discipline pervaded all ranks. Soldiers had an intense passion for gambling, reaching such excesses that troops would often wager their own uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Memoir, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers drank heavily, and was not exclusive to the lower ranks; William Howe was said to have seen many &quot;crapulous mornings&quot; while campaigning in New York. John Burgoyne drank heavily on a nightly basis towards the end of the Saratoga campaign. The two generals were also reported to have found solace with the wives of subordinate officers to ease the stressful burdens of command.&lt;ref&gt;Riedesel, Mrs. General, Letters and Journals, translated from the original German by W. L. Stone (Albany, 1867) p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; During the Philadelphia campaign, British officers deeply offended local Quakers by entertaining their mistresses in the houses they had been quartered in.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, Charles, History of the American War (London, 1794), Volume I, p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; Despite such issues, British troops are reported to have been generally scrupulous in their treatment of non-combatants.&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue, The British Army, 1783–1802, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; This is contrasted by Hessian diaries, who wrote of their disapproval of British conduct towards the colonists, such as the destruction of property and the execution of prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Schwamenfeld.&quot;The Foundation of British Strength: National Identity and the Common British Soldier.&quot; Ph.D. diss., Florida State University 2007, p. 123-124&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of Hessian soldiers caused considerable anxiety amongst the colonists, both Patriot and Loyalist, who viewed them as brutal mercenaries.&lt;ref&gt;Schwamenfeld (2007), p.123-124&lt;/ref&gt; British soldiers were often contemptuous in their treatment of Hessian troops, despite orders from General Howe that &quot;the English should treat the Germans as brothers&quot;. The order only began to have any real effect when the Hessians learned to speak a minimal degree of English, which was seen as a prerequisite for the British troops to accord them any respect.&lt;ref&gt;Schwamenfeld (2007), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

During peacetime, the Army's idleness led to it becoming riddled with corruption and inefficiency, resulting in a myriad of administrative difficulties once campaigning began.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, Anthony (2007).

==== Strategic deficiencies ====

The British leadership soon discovered it had overestimated the capabilities of its own troops, while underestimating those of the colonists, causing a sudden re-think in British planning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ketchum208_9&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Frothingham298&quot;/&gt; The ineffective initial response of British military and civil officials to the onset of the rebellion had allowed the advantage to shift to the colonists, as British authorities rapidly lost control over every colony.&lt;ref name=&quot;John C. Miller 1959 410–12&quot;/&gt; A microcosm of these shortcomings were evident at the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]. It took ten hours for the British leadership to respond following the sighting of the Americans on the Charlestown Peninsula, giving the colonists ample time to reinforce their defenses.&lt;ref name=&quot;French263&quot;&gt;[[#French|French]], pp. 263–265&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than opt for a simple flanking attack that would have rapidly succeeded with minimal loss,&lt;ref&gt;Frothingham, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; the British decided on repeated frontal attacks. The results were telling; the British suffered 1,054 casualties of a force of around 3,000 after repeated frontal assaults.&lt;ref&gt;Frothingham pp. 191, 194&lt;/ref&gt; The British leadership had nevertheless remained excessively optimistic, believing that just two regiments could suppress the rebellion in Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frothingham156&quot;&gt;[[#Frothingham|Frothingham]], p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferling15&gt;[[#Ferling|Ferling, 2015]], p. 127-129&lt;/ref&gt;

Debate persists over whether a British defeat was a guaranteed outcome. [[John E. Ferling|Ferling]] argues that the odds were so long, the defeat of Britain was nothing short of a miracle.&lt;ref&gt;John E. Ferling, ''Almost A Miracle: The American Victory in the War of Independence'' (2009), pp. 562–77.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Ellis|Ellis]], however, considers that the odds always favored the Americans, and questions whether a British victory by any margin was realistic. Ellis argues that the British squandered their only opportunities for a decisive success in 1777, and that the strategic decisions undertaken by William Howe underestimated the challenges posed by the Americans. Ellis concludes that, once Howe failed, the opportunity for a British victory &quot;would never come again&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellis 2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph J. Ellis|title=Revolutionary Summer: The Birth of American Independence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4RqZJzho1QC&amp;pg=PR11|year=2013|publisher=Random House|isbn=0307701220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the United States Army's official textbook argues that, had Britain been able to commit 10,000 fresh troops to the war in 1780, a British victory was within the realms of possibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard W.

===== William Howe =====

[[File:WilliamHowe1777ColorMezzotint.jpeg|thumb|left|A 1777 mezzotint of Sir William Howe, British [[Commander-in-Chief, North America|Commander-in-Chief]] from 1775–1778]]

Historians such as Ellis and Stewart have observed that, under William Howe's command, the British squandered several opportunities to achieve a decisive victory over the Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard W. Stewart 2005 p. 103&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellis 2013&quot; /&gt; Throughout the New York and Philadelphia campaigns, Howe made several strategic errors, errors which cost the British opportunities for a complete victory.

During planning for the Saratoga campaign, Howe was left with the choice of committing his army to support Burgoyne, or capture Philadelphia, the revolutionary capital. Howe decided upon the latter, determining that Washington was of a greater threat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ketchum, 1999 p. 81&quot;/&gt; The decision left Burgoyne precariously isolated,&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin, p. 11-15&quot;/&gt; and left the Americans confounded at the decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;John E 2010&quot;/&gt; Alden argues Howe may have been motivated by [[political opportunism]]; if Burgoyne was successful, he would receive the credit for a decisive victory, and not Howe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alden, 1954 p. 118&quot;/&gt; However, the confusion was further compounded by the lack of explicit and contradictory instructions from London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Black |first=Jeremy |title=War for America: The Fight for Independence, 1775–1783 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |year=1991 |isbn=0-312-06713-5 |ref=Black}}, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; When Howe launched his campaign, he took his army upon a time-consuming route through the Chesapeake Bay, rather than the more sensible choices of overland through New Jersey, or by sea through the Delaware Bay. The move left him unable to assist Burgoyne even if it was required of him. The decision so confused Parliament, that Howe was accused by Tories on both sides of the Atlantic of treason.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campaign of 1777&quot;/&gt;

During the Philadelphia campaign, Howe failed to pursue and destroy the defeated Americans on two occasions; once after the [[Battle of Brandywine]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Higginbotham pp. 181&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams, Charles Francis p. 43&quot;/&gt; and again after the [[Battle of Germantown]].&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.co.uk&quot;/&gt; At the [[Battle of White Marsh]], Howe failed to even attempt to exploit the vulnerable American rear,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cadwalader|first=Richard McCall|title=Observance of the One Hundred and Twenty-third Anniversary of the Evacuation of Philadelphia by the British Army.

Kennedy 2014 163&quot;/&gt;

Contrary to Howe's more hostile critics, however, there were strategic factors at play which impeded aggressive action. Howe may have been dissuaded from pursuing aggressive manoeuvres due to the memory of the grievous losses the British suffered at Bunker Hill.&lt;ref&gt;Frothingham pp. 152–153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Kenneth T; Dunbar, David S (2005). Empire City: New York Through the Centuries. Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-231-10909-3}}, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; During the major campaigns in New York and Philadelphia, Howe often wrote of the scarcity of adequate provisions, which hampered his ability to mount effective campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Office Papers, Manuscripts in the Public Record Office, 5:93, Howe to Dartmouth, 1st December 1775&lt;/ref&gt;  Howe's tardiness in launching the New York campaign, and his reluctance to allow Cornwallis to vigorously pursue Washington's beaten army, have both been attributed to the paucity of available food supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Office Papers, 5:93, Howe to Germain, 7 June and 7 July 1776&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A View of the Evidence (London, 1783), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

During the winter of 1776–1777, Howe split his army into scattered cantonments. This decision dangerously exposed the individual forces to defeat in detail, as the distance between them was such that they could not mutually support each other. This strategic failure allowed the Americans to achieve victory at the [[Battle of Trenton]], and the concurrent [[Battle of Princeton]].&lt;ref&gt;Correspondence of George III with Lord North, Volume II, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; While a major strategic error to divide an army in such a manner, the quantity of available food supplies in New York was so low that Howe had been compelled to take such a decision. The garrisons were widely spaced so their respective foraging parties would not interfere with each other's efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Office Papers, 5:93, Howe to Germain, 30 Nov 1776&lt;/ref&gt; Howe's difficulties during the Philadelphia campaign were also greatly exacerbated by the poor quality and quantity of available provisions.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, American War, Volume I, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Clinton and Cornwallis =====

[[File:First Marquis of Cornwallis.jpg|thumb|right|General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]], who led British forces in the [[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|southern campaign]].]]

In 1780, the primary British strategy hinged upon a Loyalist uprising in the south, for which Charles Cornwallis was chiefly responsible. After an encouraging success at [[Battle of Camden|Camden]], Cornwallis was poised to invade North Carolina. However, any significant Loyalist support had been effectively destroyed at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Buchanan, p. 241&quot;/&gt; and the British Legion, the cream of his army, had been decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Cowpens]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Buchanan, p. 326&quot;/&gt; Following both defeats, Cornwallis was fiercely criticized for detaching a significant portion of his army without adequate mutual support.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Despite the defeats, Cornwallis chose to proceed into North Carolina, gambling his success upon a large Loyalist uprising which never materialized.&lt;ref name=&quot;clements.umich.edu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lumpkin 2000&quot;&gt;Lumpkin, From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, subsequent engagements cost Cornwallis valuable troops he could not replace, as at the [[Battle of Guilford Courthouse]],&lt;ref name=&quot;MtVernon&quot; /&gt; and the Americans steadily wore his army down in an exhaustive [[war of attrition]].&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan, Sir George Otto (1914). George the Third and Charles Fox: The Concluding Part of The American Revolution. New York and elsewhere: Longmans, Green and Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Cornwallis had thus left the Carolinas ripe for reconquest. The Americans had largely achieved this aim by the end of 1781, effectively confining the British to the coast, and undoing all the progress they had made in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Pancake, John (1985). This Destructive War. University of Alabama Press. {{ISBN|0-8173-0191-7}}., p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

In a last-ditch attempt to win the war in the South, Cornwallis resolved to invade Virginia, in order to cut off the American's supply base to the Carolinas. Henry Clinton, Cornwallis' superior, strongly opposed the plan, believing the decisive confrontations would take place between Washington in the North.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; London had approved Cornwallis plan, however they had failed to include Clinton in the decision-making, despite his seniority over Cornwallis, leading to a muddled strategic direction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Public Record Office&quot;/&gt; Cornwallis then decided to invade Virginia without informing Clinton of his intentions.&lt;ref&gt;Clinton, H.; ''The American Rebellion''. Note: This lack of notification was one of Clinton's main arguments in his own defense in the controversy that followed the surrender at Yorktown.&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton, however, had wholly failed to construct a coherent strategy for British campaigning that year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grainger|first=John|title=The Battle of Yorktown, 1781: a Reassessment|publisher=Boydell Press|year=2005|location=Woodbridge, NJ|isbn=978-1-84383-137-2|oclc=232006312}}, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; owing to his fractious relationship that he shared with Mariot Arbuthnot, his naval counterpart.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billias 1969&quot;/&gt;

As the Franco-American army approached Cornwallis at Yorktown, he made no attempt to [[sally (military)|sally out]] and engage before siege lines could be erected,&lt;ref&gt;Wickwire, Franklin and Mary (1970). Cornwallis: The American Adventure.

General George Washington. New York: Random House Paperbacks. {{ISBN|0-8129-6950-2}}., p. 337&lt;/ref&gt; These factors contributed to the eventual surrender of Cornwallis' entire army, and the end of major operations in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Thomas (1970).

Like Howe before him, Clinton's efforts to campaign suffered from chronic supply issues. In 1778, Clinton wrote to Germain complaining of the lack of supplies, even after the arrival of a convoy from Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Office Papers, 5:96, Clinton to Germain, 15 September 1778&lt;/ref&gt; That winter, the supply issue had deteriorated so badly, that Clinton expressed considerable anxiety over how the troops were going to be properly fed.&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Office Papers, 5:97, Clinton to Germain, 15 December 1778&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton was largely inactive in the North throughout 1779, launching few major campaigns. This inactivity was partially due to the shortage of food.&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Office Papers, 5:98, Haldimand to Clinton, 19 July and 29 August 1779&lt;/ref&gt; By 1780, the situation had not improved. Clinton wrote a frustrated correspondence to Germain, voicing concern that a &quot;fatal consequence will ensue&quot; if matters did not improve. By October that year, Clinton again wrote to Germain, angered that the troops in New York had not received &quot;an ounce&quot; of that year's allotted stores from Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Office Papers, 5:100, Clinton to Germain, 31st October 1780&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Campaign issues ====

Suppressing a rebellion in America presented the British with major problems. The key issue was distance; it could take up to three months to cross the Atlantic, and orders from London were often outdated by the time that they arrived.&lt;ref&gt;Black (2001), p. 39; Greene and Pole (1999), pp. 298, 306&lt;/ref&gt; The colonies had never been formally united prior to the conflict and there was no centralized area of ultimate strategic importance. Traditionally, the fall of a capital city often signalled the end of a conflict,&lt;ref&gt;Rossman, Vadim (2016), &quot;Capital Cities: Varieties and Patterns of Development and Relocation&quot;, Taylor &amp; Francis, {{ISBN|1317562852}}, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; yet the war continued unabated even after the fall of major settlements such as New York, Philadelphia (which was the Patriot capital), and Charleston.&lt;ref&gt;Edward E. Curtis, The Organization of the British Army in the American Revolution, Conclusion, (Yale U.P. 1926), [http://www.americanrevolution.org/britisharmy6.php] Retrieved 10 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Britain's ability to project its power overseas lay chiefly in the power of the Royal Navy, allowing her to control major coastal settlements with relative ease and enforce a strong blockade of colonial ports. However, the overwhelming majority of the American population was [[agrarian society|agrarian]], not urban. As a result, the American economy proved resilient enough to withstand the blockade's effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pole 2004&quot;/&gt;

[[File:John Singleton Copley 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Black Loyalist]] soldiers fought alongside [[British Army|British regulars]] in the 1781 [[Battle of Jersey]], from ''[[The Death of Major Peirson]]'']]

The need to maintain Loyalist support prevented the British from using the harsh methods of suppressing revolts that they had used in [[Jacobite rising of 1745#Legacy|Scotland]] and [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Black (2001), p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, British troops looted and pillaged the locals during an aborted attack on Charleston in 1779, enraging both Patriots and Loyalists.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, David K (2005).

The Loyalists in Revolutionary America, 1760–1781 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; The vastness of the American countryside and the limited manpower available meant that the British could never simultaneously defeat the Americans and occupy captured territory. One British statesman described the attempt as &quot;like trying to conquer a map&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, &quot;The Organization of the British Army in the American Revolution, Conclusion&lt;/ref&gt;

Wealthy Loyalists wielded great influence in London&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor.org&quot;/&gt; and were successful in convincing the British that the majority view in the colonies was sympathetic toward the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo Sabine, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC00425953&amp;id=QjUNAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage#v=onepage&amp;q=%22In%20nearly%20every%20loyalist%20letter%22&amp;f=false ''Biographical Sketches of Loyalists of the American Revolution''], Vol. I (1864) p. 48; Sabine adds they were certainly wrong.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, British planners pinned the success of their strategies on popular uprisings of Loyalists,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wickwire p.315&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;clements.umich.edu&quot;/&gt; which never transpired on the scale required.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lumpkin 2000&quot;/&gt; Historians have estimated that Loyalists made up only 15–20% of the population (vs. 40-45% Patriots)&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole (1999), p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; and that they continued to deceive themselves on their level of support as late as 1780.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lecky1891&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=William Edward Hartpole Lecky|title=A History of England: In the Eighteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m3cUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA139|year=1891|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British discovered that any significant level of organized Loyalist activity would require the continued presence of British regulars,&lt;ref&gt;Black (2001), p.&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;/ref&gt; which presented them with a major dilemma. The manpower that the British had available was insufficient to both protect Loyalist territory and counter American advances.&lt;ref&gt;Black (2001), p.&amp;nbsp;13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; The vulnerability of Loyalist militias was repeatedly demonstrated in the South, where they suffered strings of defeats to their Patriot neighbors. The most crucial juncture of this was at Kings Mountain, and the victory of the Patriot partisans irreversibly crippled Loyalist military capability in the South.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buchanan, p. 241&quot;/&gt;

Upon the entry of France and Spain into the conflict, the British were forced to severely limit the number of troops and warships that they sent to North America in order to defend other key territories and the British mainland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ketchum 1997, p. 405–448&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Higginbotham 1983, pp. 175–88&quot;/&gt; As a result, King George III abandoned any hope of subduing America militarily while he had a European war to contend with.&lt;ref&gt;Ferling (2007), p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; The small size of Britain's army left them unable to concentrate their resources primarily in one [[theater (military)|theater]] as they had done in the Seven Years' War, leaving them at a critical disadvantage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cf., Richard Pares, 1936: 429–65&quot;/&gt; The British were compelled to disperse troops from the Americas to Europe and the East Indies, and these forces were unable to assist one other as a result, precariously exposing them to defeat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alfred Thayer Mahan 1890 p. 534&quot;/&gt; In North America, the immediate strategic focus of the French, Spanish, and British shifted to Jamaica,&lt;ref&gt;Dull, (1985) p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; whose sugar exports were more valuable to the British than the economy of the Thirteen Colonies combined.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Shaughnessy p. 208&quot;/&gt;

Following the end of the war, Britain had lost some of her most populous colonies. However, the economic effects of the loss were negligible in the long-term, and she became a global superpower just 32 years after the end of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Tellier, L.-N. (2009).

The Americans began the war with significant disadvantages compared to the British. They had no national government, no national army or navy, no financial system, no banks, no established credit, and no functioning government departments, such as a treasury. The Congress tried to handle administrative affairs through legislative committees, which proved inefficient. The state governments were themselves brand new and officials had no administrative experience. In peacetime the colonies relied heavily on ocean travel and shipping, but that was now shut down by the British blockade and the Americans had to rely on slow overland travel.

However, the Americans had multiple advantages that in the long run outweighed the initial disadvantages they faced. The Americans had a large prosperous population that depended not on imports but on local production for food and most supplies, while the British were mostly shipped in from across the ocean. The British faced a vast territory far larger than Britain or France, located at a far distance from home ports. Most of the Americans lived on farms distant from the seaports—the British could capture any port but that did not give them control over the hinterland. They were on their home ground, had a smoothly functioning, well organized system of local and state governments, newspapers and printers, and internal lines of communications. They had a long-established system of local militia, previously used to combat the French and Native Americans, with companies and an officer corps that could form the basis of local militias, and provide a training ground for the national army created by Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Pole and Greene, eds. '' Companion to the American Revolution'', ch. 36–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Motivation was a major asset. The Patriots wanted to win; over 200,000 fought in the war; 25,000 died. The British expected the Loyalists to do much of the fighting, but they did much less than expected. The British also hired German mercenaries to do much of their fighting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Lanning 2009 195–96&quot;/&gt;

At the onset of the war, the Americans had no major international allies. Battles such as the [[Battle of Bennington]], the [[Battles of Saratoga]] and even defeats such as the [[Battle of Germantown]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Trevelyan, p. 249&quot;&gt;Trevelyan, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; proved decisive in gaining the attention and support of powerful European nations such as France and Spain, who moved from covertly supplying the Americans with weapons and supplies, to overtly supporting them militarily, moving the war to a global stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;K405_48&quot;&gt;[[#Ketchum|Ketchum (1997)]], pp. 405–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Continental Army suffered significantly from a lack of an effective training regime, and largely inexperienced officers and sergeants. The inexperience of its officers was compensated for in part by its senior officers; officers such as [[George Washington]], [[Horatio Gates]], [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]], [[Richard Montgomery]] and [[Francis Marion]] all had military experience with the British Army during the [[French and Indian War]]. The Americans solved their training dilemma during their stint in Winter Quarters at Valley Forge, where they were relentlessly drilled and trained by General [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], a veteran of the famed Prussian General Staff. He taught the Continental Army the essentials of military discipline, drills, tactics and strategy, and wrote the [[Revolutionary War Drill Manual]].&lt;ref&gt;Philander D.

[[File:Population Density in the American Colonies 1775.gif|thumb|right|Population density in the [[American Colonies]] in 1775]]
When the war began, the 13 colonies lacked a professional army or navy. Each colony sponsored local [[militia]]. Militiamen were lightly armed, had little training, and usually did not have uniforms. Their units served for only a few weeks or months at a time, were reluctant to travel far from home and thus were unavailable for extended operations, and lacked the training and discipline of soldiers with more experience. If properly used, however, their numbers could help the Continental armies overwhelm smaller British forces, as at the [[Battles of the American Revolutionary War|battles]] of [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Concord]], [[Battle of Bennington|Bennington]] and [[Saratoga campaign|Saratoga]], and the [[siege of Boston]]. Both sides used partisan warfare but the Americans effectively suppressed Loyalist activity when [[British Regulars|British regulars]] were not in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black 2001 p. 59&quot;/&gt;

Seeking to coordinate military efforts, the [[First Continental Congress|Continental Congress]] established a regular army on June 14, 1775, and appointed [[George Washington]] as commander-in-chief. The development of the Continental Army was always a work in progress, and Washington used both his regulars and state militia throughout the war.

Three current branches of the [[United States Military]] trace their institutional roots to the American Revolutionary War; the [[United States Army]] comes from the [[Continental Army]], formed by a resolution of the Continental Congress on June 14, 1775. The [[United States Navy]] recognizes October 13, 1775 as the date of its official establishment, the passage of the resolution of the Continental Congress at Philadelphia that created the [[Continental Navy]].&lt;ref name=Establish&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq59-13.htm|title=Establishment of the Navy, 13&amp;nbsp;October 1775|publisher=United States Navy|accessdate=November 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And the [[United States Marine Corps]] traces its institutional roots to the [[Continental Marines]] of the war, formed  by a resolution of the Continental Congress on November 10, 1775, a date regarded and celebrated as the birthday of the Marine Corps. At the beginning of 1776, Washington's army had 20,000 men, with two-thirds enlisted in the Continental Army and the other third in the various state militias.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tread&quot;&gt;Crocker (2006), p.&amp;nbsp;51.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the American Revolution in 1783, both the [[Continental Navy]] and Continental Marines were disbanded. About 250,000 men served as regulars or as militiamen for the Revolutionary cause in the eight years of the war, but there were never more than 90,000 men under arms at one time. About 55,000 American sailors served aboard privateers during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmm.org/revolution.html |title=Privateers or Merchant Mariners help win the Revolutionary War |publisher=Usmm.org |date= |accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American privateers had almost 1,700 ships, and they captured 2,283 enemy ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Pike&quot;/&gt; [[John Paul Jones]] became the first great American naval hero, capturing [[HMS Drake (1777)|HMS ''Drake'']] on April 24, 1778, the first victory for any American military vessel in British waters.&lt;ref&gt;Higginbotham (1983), pp.&amp;nbsp;331–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Armies were small by European standards of the era, largely attributable to limitations such as lack of powder and other logistical capabilities on the American side.&lt;ref&gt;Boatner (1974), p.&amp;nbsp;264 says the largest force Washington commanded was &quot;under 17,000&quot;; Duffy (1987), p.&amp;nbsp;17, estimates Washington's maximum was &quot;only 13,000 troops&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also difficult for Great Britain to transport troops across the Atlantic and they depended on local supplies that the Patriots tried to cut off. By comparison, Duffy notes that [[Frederick the Great]] usually commanded from 23,000 to 50,000 in battle.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Both figures pale in comparison to the armies that were fielded in the early 19th century, where troop formations approached or exceeded 100,000 men.

=== African Americans ===
[[File:Soldiers at the siege of Yorktown (1781), by Jean-Baptiste-Antoine DeVerger.png|thumb|1780 drawing of American soldiers from the [[Yorktown campaign]] shows a black infantryman from the [[1st Rhode Island Regiment]].]]
[[African Americans in the Revolutionary War|African Americans]]—slave and free—served on both sides during the war. The British recruited slaves belonging to [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] masters and promised freedom to those who served by act of Lord [[Dunmore's Proclamation]]. Because of manpower shortages, George Washington lifted the ban on black enlistment in the Continental Army in January 1776. Small all-black units were formed in [[Rhode Island]] and [[Massachusetts]]; many slaves were promised freedom for serving. Some of the men promised freedom were sent back to their masters, after the war was over, out of political convenience. Another all-black unit came from [[Saint-Domingue]] with French colonial forces. At least 5,000 black soldiers fought for the Revolutionary cause.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan and Kaplan (1989), pp.&amp;nbsp;64–69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leslie Alexander|title=Encyclopedia of African American History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uivtCqOlpTsC&amp;pg=PA356|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=356|isbn=9781851097746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tens of thousands of slaves escaped during the war and joined British lines; others simply moved off in the chaos. For instance, in South Carolina, nearly 25,000 slaves (30% of the enslaved population) fled, migrated or died during the disruption of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619–1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1994, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; This greatly disrupted plantation production during and after the war. When they withdrew their forces from Savannah and Charleston, the British also evacuated 10,000 slaves belonging to Loyalists.&lt;ref&gt;Kolchin, p.73&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, the British evacuated nearly 20,000 blacks at the end of the war. More than 3,000 of them were freedmen and most of these were resettled in Nova Scotia; other blacks were sold in the West Indies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Weir|title=The Encyclopedia of African American Military History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WEXj4gHHARgC&amp;pg=PA32|year=2004|publisher=Prometheus Books|pages=31–32|isbn=9781615928316}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassadra Pybus, &quot;Jefferson's Faulty Math: the Question of Slave Defections in the American Revolution&quot;, ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (2005) 62#2 pp: 243–264.

=== American Indians ===
Most [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] east of the [[Mississippi River]] were affected by the war, and many tribes were divided over the question of how to respond to the conflict. A few tribes were on friendly terms with the other Americans, but most Indians opposed the union of the Colonies as a potential threat to their territory. Approximately 13,000 Indians fought on the British side, with the largest group coming from the [[Iroquois]] tribes, who fielded around 1,500 men.&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;393; Boatner (1974), p.&amp;nbsp;545.&lt;/ref&gt; The powerful [[Iroquois Confederacy]] was shattered as a result of the conflict, although they did not take sides; the [[Seneca nation|Seneca]], [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]], and [[Cayuga nation|Cayuga]] nations sided with the British. Members of the [[Mohawk nation]] fought on both sides. Many [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora]] and [[Oneida tribe|Oneida]] sided with the colonists. The Continental Army sent the [[Sullivan Expedition]] on raids throughout New York to cripple the Iroquois tribes that had sided with the British. Mohawk leaders [[Joseph Louis Cook]] and [[Joseph Brant]] sided with the Americans and the British respectively, and this further exacerbated the split.

Early in July 1776, a major action occurred in the fledgling conflict when the [[Cherokee]] allies of Britain attacked the [[Washington District, North Carolina|western frontier areas]] of [[North Carolina Colony|North Carolina]]. Their defeat resulted in a splintering of the Cherokee settlements and people, and was directly responsible for the rise of the [[Chickamauga Cherokee]], bitter enemies of the Colonials who carried on a [[Cherokee–American wars|frontier war]] for decades following the end of hostilities with Britain.&lt;ref name=finger1&gt;John Finger, ''Tennessee Frontiers: Three Regions in Transition'' (Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 2001), pp. 43–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muscogee people|Creek]] and [[Seminole]] allies of Britain fought against Americans in Georgia and South Carolina. In 1778, a force of 800 Creeks destroyed American settlements along the [[Broad River (Georgia)|Broad River]] in Georgia. Creek warriors also joined [[Thomas Brown (loyalist)|Thomas Brown's]] raids into South Carolina and assisted Britain during the [[Siege of Savannah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Harry M.|title=The war for independence and the transformation of American society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kgqa4_OBcIkC&amp;pg=PA198|accessdate=March 25, 2011|year=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-85728-656-4|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Indians were involved in the fighting between Britain and Spain on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] and up the Mississippi River—mostly on the British side. Thousands of Creeks, [[Chickasaw]]s, and [[Choctaw]]s fought in major battles such as the [[Battle of Fort Charlotte]], the [[Battle of Mobile (1781)|Battle of Mobile]], and the [[Siege of Pensacola]].&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien|first=Greg|title=Pre-removal Choctaw history: exploring new paths|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGFmNPevedUC&amp;pg=PA123|accessdate=March 25, 2011|date=April 30, 2008|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3916-6|pages=123–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Race and class ===
Pybus (2005) estimates that about 20,000 slaves defected to or were captured by the British, of whom about 8,000 died from disease or wounds or were recaptured by the Patriots. The British took some 12,000 at the end of the war; of these 8000 remained in slavery. Including those who left during the war, a total of about 8000 to 10,000 slaves gained freedom.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3491601 Cassandra Pybus, &quot;Jefferson's Faulty Math: the Question of Slave Defections in the American Revolution&quot;], ''William and Mary Quarterly'' 2005 62#2: 243–264.&lt;/ref&gt; About 4000 freed slaves went to Nova Scotia and 1200 blacks remained slaves.&lt;ref&gt;John N. Grant, &quot;Black Immigrants into Nova Scotia, 1776–1815.&quot; ''Journal of Negro History'' (1973): 253–270. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2716777 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James W. St G. Walker, ''The Black Loyalists: The Search for a Promised Land in Nova Scotia and Sierra Leone, 1783–1870'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

Baller (2006) examines family dynamics and mobilization for the Revolution in central Massachusetts. He reports that warfare and the farming culture were sometimes incompatible. Militiamen found that living and working on the family farm had not prepared them for wartime marches and the rigors of camp life. Rugged individualism conflicted with military discipline and regimentation. A man's birth order often influenced his military recruitment, as younger sons went to war and older sons took charge of the farm. A person's family responsibilities and the prevalent patriarchy could impede mobilization. Harvesting duties and family emergencies pulled men home regardless of the sergeant's orders. Some relatives might be Loyalists, creating internal strains. On the whole, historians conclude the Revolution's effect on patriarchy and inheritance patterns favored [[egalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;William Baller, &quot;Farm Families and the American Revolution,&quot; ''Journal of Family History'' (2006) 31(1): 28–44. {{ISSN|0363-1990}}.

McDonnell (2006) shows a grave complication in Virginia's mobilization of troops was the conflicting interests of distinct social classes, which tended to undercut a unified commitment to the Patriot cause. The Assembly balanced the competing demands of elite slave-owning planters, [[Plain Folk of the Old South|the middling yeomen]] (some owning a few slaves), and landless indentured servants, among other groups. The Assembly used deferments, taxes, military service substitute, and conscription to resolve the tensions. Unresolved class conflict, however, made these laws less effective. There were violent protests, many cases of evasion, and large-scale desertion, so that Virginia's contributions came at embarrassingly low levels. With the British invasion of the state in 1781, Virginia was mired in class division as its native son, George Washington, made desperate appeals for troops.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A.
