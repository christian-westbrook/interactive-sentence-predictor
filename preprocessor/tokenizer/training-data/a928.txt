''' Alberta's economy''' is the sum of all [[economic activity]] in [[Alberta]], [[Canadian provinces by population|Canada's fourth largest province by population]].  Although Alberta has a presence in many industries such as agriculture, forestry, education, tourism, finance, and manufacturing, the politics and culture of the province have been closely tied to the production of [[fossil energy]] since the 1940s. Alberta—with an estimated 1.4 billion cubic metres of [[unconventional oil]] resource in the bituminous [[oil sands]]—leads Canada as an oil producer.&lt;ref name=&quot;statcan_2003&quot; /&gt; Revenue from oil and natural gas extraction has fueled a series of economic booms in the province's recent history, and [[economic spin-off]]s have included petrochemical and pipelines. In 1985 36.1% of Alberta's $66.8 billion GDP was from energy industries. In 2012, &quot;the mining and oil and gas extraction industry made up 23.3% of Alberta's GDP.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;occinfo_alis_alberta_2016&quot; /&gt; By 2013 Alberta's GDP was $331.9 billion with 24.6% in energy. The energy industry provided 7.7% of all jobs in Alberta in 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;economic_results_AB2015&quot; /&gt;

From 1990 to 2003, Alberta's economy grew by 57% compared to 43% for all of Canada—the strongest economic growth of any region in Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;statcan_2003&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-621-m/11-621-m2005023-eng.htm#tm8 | title=Canada, a Big Energy Consumer: A Regional Perspective | publisher=Statistics Canada | date=November 12, 2009 | accessdate=March 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 Alberta's per capita GDP was [[List of U.S. states by GDP per capita (nominal)|higher than all US states]], and [[List of country subdivisions by GDP per capita (nominal)|one of the highest figures in the world]]. In 2006, the deviation from the national average was the largest for any province in Canadian history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url= http://www.statcan.ca/english/ads/11-010-XPB/pdf/sep06.pdf | author= Statistics Canada | authorlink= Statistics Canada | title= The Alberta economic Juggernaught:The boom on the rose | date= September 2006 | accessdate= 2007-02-02 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061109110655/http://www.statcan.ca/english/ads/11-010-XPB/pdf/sep06.pdf | archivedate= 2006-11-09 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alberta's per capita GDP in 2007 was by far the highest of any province in Canada at [[Canadian dollar|C$]]74,825 (approx. US$75,000). Alberta's per capita GDP in 2007 was 61% higher than the Canadian average of [[Canadian dollar|C$]]46,441 and more than twice that of all the [[Maritime provinces]]. From 2004 to 2014 Alberta's &quot;exports of commodities rose 91%, reaching $121 billion in 2014&quot; and 500,000 new jobs were created.&lt;ref name=&quot;economic_results_AB2015&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.albertacanada.com/business/overview/economic-results.aspx | title=Economic results | publisher=Government of Alberta | date=October 25, 2015 | accessdate=March 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Alberta’s real GDP by expenditure grew by 4.8%, the strongest growth rate among the provinces.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;finance_alberta_about_2016_mar_11&quot; /&gt;

==Minister of Finance quarterly reports==

Each fiscal quarter the office of Alberta Treasury Board and Finance submits a report which includes an updated Alberta economic outlook and predictions for the following year.

===2015–16 Third Quarter Fiscal Update and Economic Statement===

In the third quarterly fiscal update published in February 2016, forecasts for the Crown debt was $18.9 billion compared to a surplus of $1.12 billion in 2014/2015. The deficit was forecast at $6.3 billion, revenue was forecast to be $43.1&amp;nbsp;billion and the expense was forecast at $49.4 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;financealberta_2016_Feb&quot;&gt;{{cite report | url=http://finance.alberta.ca/publications/budget/quarterly/2015/2015-16-3rd-Quarter-Fiscal-Update.pdf#page=12 | title=2015–16 Third Quarter Fiscal Update and Economic Statement | publisher=Department of Finance, Government of Alberta | date=February 2016 | accessdate=16 March 2016 |location=Edmonton, Alberta |pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} The 2015/2016 forecast for non-renewable resource revenue has been decreased to $2.47, down from In 2014-15 the non-renewable resource revenue was $8.95 billion.

===2015–16 First Quarter Fiscal Update and Economic Statement===

On August 30, 2015, [[Joe Ceci]] Minister of Finance of Alberta, released the quarterly fiscal update which covers the period from April 1 to June 30, stating that the Alberta budget &quot;could include a deficit of as much as $6.5-billion (Canadian) – $1.1-billion more than his previous estimate – if the oil industry downturn persists at recent levels.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;deficit&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/brent-crude-falls-back-below-49-as-glut-china-concerns-weigh/article26161858/ | title=Alberta could face record deficit amid oil’s downturn | work=The Globe and Mail | date=31 August 2015 | accessdate=31 August 2015 | author=Jones,  Jeffrey | location=Calgary | author2=Lewis, Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;recession&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/alberta/alberta-economy-will-be-in-recession-notley-government-confirms/article26166618/ | title=Alberta economy in recession, Notley government confirms | work=The Globe and Mail | date=31 August 2015 | accessdate=31 August 2015 | author=Giovannetti, Justin | location=Edmonton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rachel Notley’s NDP party came into power on May 24, 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;recession&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AB_quarterly fiscal update 2015_08&quot;&gt;{{cite report | url=http://www.finance.alberta.ca/publications/budget/quarterly/2015/2015-16-1st-Quarter-Fiscal-Update.pdf | title=2015–16 First Quarter Fiscal Update and Economic Statement | work=Government of Alberta | date=August 2015 | agency=Alberta Treasury Board and Finance | accessdate=1 September 2015 | author=Alberta Treasury Board and Finance | location=Edmonton | pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors such as the lower Canadian-US exchange rate and the lower [[Western Canadian Select|WTI-WCS]] price differential bolstered the otherwise downgraded outlook. The dramatic drop in the [[price of oil]], weakened Alberta's economic outlook&lt;ref name=&quot;AB_quarterly fiscal update 2015_08&quot; /&gt;{{rp|12}} and continued to contribute to the province's loss of revenue. Alberta's oil and gas investment is &quot;expected to fall over 30% in 2015, with weakness carrying into 2016.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AB_quarterly fiscal update 2015_08&quot; /&gt;{{rp|12}} From January through July oil rig activity declined almost 50%.&lt;ref name=&quot;AB_quarterly fiscal update 2015_08&quot; /&gt;{{rp|12}} By July 2015 the unemployment rate was 6.0%.&lt;ref name=&quot;AB_quarterly fiscal update 2015_08&quot; /&gt;{{rp|13}} In spite of the rising unemployment rate, and the outflow of some Albertans due to job loss, 7,723 people from outside Alberta moved there from January to April, leaving a positive net flow with a forecast population growth of 2% in 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;AB_quarterly fiscal update 2015_08&quot; /&gt;{{rp|13}}

==Economic geography==
[[File:Alberta, Canada.svg|thumb|left|Alberta's location within Canada]]
{{see also|Geography of Alberta|List of regions of Alberta}}

Alberta has a small internal market, and it is relatively distant from major [[World economy|world market]]s, despite good [[transportation in Canada|transportation links to the rest of Canada]] and [[transportation in the United States|to the United States to the south]]. Alberta is located in the [[Geography of North America|northwestern quadrant]] of [[North America]], in a region of low [[population density]] called the [[Interior Plains]]. Alberta is [[landlocked]], and separated by [[Western Cordillera (North America)|a series of mountain ranges]] from the nearest [[List of North American ports#Canada 5|outlets]] to the [[British Columbia Coast|Pacific Ocean]], and by the [[Canadian Shield]] from ports on [[Thunder Bay|the Lakehead]] or [[Hudson Bay]]. From these ports to major populations centres and markets in Europe or Asia is several thousands of kilometers. The largest population clusters of North America (the [[Northeast megalopolis|Boston&amp;nbsp;– Washington]], [[California megapolitan areas|San Francisco - San Diego]], [[Great Lakes Megalopolis|Chicago&amp;nbsp;– Pittsburgh]], and [[Quebec City&amp;nbsp;– Windsor Corridor]]s) are all thousands of kilometers away from Alberta. Partly for this reason, Alberta has never developed a large presence in the industries that have traditionally started [[industrialization]] in other places (notably the original [[Industrial Revolution]] in Great Britain) but which require large [[labour force]]s, and large internal markets or easy transportation to export markets, namely [[Textile manufacturing|textiles]], [[metallurgy]], or transportation-related manufacturing ([[automotive manufacturing|automotives]], [[ship building|ships]], or [[List of locomotive builders|train cars]]).

[[Agriculture in Canada|Agriculture]] has the been a key industry since the 1870s. The climate is dry, [[temperate]], and [[continental climate|continental]], with extreme variations between seasons. Productive soils are found in most of the southern half of the province (excluding the mountains), and in certain parts of the north. Agriculture on a large scale is practiced further north in Alberta than anywhere else in North America, extending into the [[Peace River country]] above the [[55th parallel north]]. Generally, however, [[northern Alberta]] (and areas along the [[Alberta Rockies]]) is forested land and [[logging]] is more important than agriculture there. Agriculture is divided into primarily [[field crops]] in the east, [[livestock]] in the west, and a mixture in between and in the [[Aspen parkland|parkland belt]] in the near north.

Conventional oil and gas fields are found throughout the province on an axis running from the northwest to the southeast. Oil sands are found in the northeast, especially around [[Fort McMurray]] (the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]]).

Because of its (relatively) economically isolated location, Alberta relies heavily on [[transportation in Alberta|transportation links]] with the rest of the world. Alberta's historical development has been largely influenced by the development of new [[transportation infrastructure]], (see &quot;trends&quot; below). Alberta is now served by two major [[transcontinental railways]] ([[Canadian National Railway|CN]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CP]]), by three major highway connections to the Pacific (the [[Trans-Canada (highway)|Trans-Canada]] via [[Kicking Horse Pass]], the [[Yellowhead (highway)|Yellowhead]] via [[Yellowhead Pass]] and the [[Crowsnest (highway)|Crowsnest]] via [[Crowsnest Pass]]), and one to the United States ([[Interstate 15]]), as well as two international airports ([[Calgary International Airport|Calgary]] and [[Edmonton International Airport|Edmonton]]).  Also, Alberta is connected to the [[TransCanada pipeline|TransCanada pipeline system]] (natural gas) to Eastern Canada, the [[Northern Border Pipeline]] (gas), [[Alliance Pipeline]] (gas)  and [[Enbridge Pipeline System]] (oil) to the Eastern United States, the [[Gas Transmission Northwest]] and [[Northwest Pipeline]] (gas) to the Western United States, and the [[McNeill HVDC Back-to-back station]] (electric power) to Saskatchewan.

{{Economy of Canada}}

=== Economic regions and cities ===
Since the days of early agricultural settlement, the majority of Alberta's population has been concentrated in the [[parkland belt]] (mixed forest-grassland), a boomerang-shaped strip of land extending along the [[North Saskatchewan River]] from Lloydminster to Edmonton and then along the [[Rocky Mountain foothills]] south to Calgary.  This area is slightly more humid and treed than the drier [[prairie]] (grassland) region called [[Palliser's Triangle]] to its south, and large areas of the south (the “[[Special Areas, Alberta|Special Areas]]”) were [[depopulated]] during the [[drought]]s of the 1920s and 30s.  The [[chernozem]] (black soil) of the parkland region is more agriculturally productive than the red and grey soils to the south.  Urban development has also been most advanced in the parkland belt.  Edmonton and Red Deer are parkland cities, while Calgary is on the parkland-prairie fringe.  Lethbridge and Medicine Hat are prairie cities.  Grande Prairie lies in the [[Peace River Country]] a parkland region (with isolated patches of prairie, hence the name) in the northwest isolated from the rest of the parkland by the forested [[Swan Hills]].  [[Fort McMurray]] is the only urbanized population centre in the [[boreal forest of Canada|boreal forest]] which covers much of the northern half of the province.

==== Calgary and Edmonton ====
The Calgary and Edmonton regions, by far the province's two largest metropolitan regions, account for the majority of the province’s population.  They are relatively close to each other by the standards of Western Canada and distant from other metropolitan regions such as Vancouver or Winnipeg.  This has produced a history of political and economical rivalry and comparison but also economic integration that has created an urbanized corridor between the two cities.

The economic profile of the two regions is slightly different.  Both cities are mature service economies built on a base of resource extraction in their hinterlands.  However Calgary is predominant in hosting the regional and national headquarters of oil and gas exploration and drilling companies.  Edmonton skews much more towards governments, universities and hospitals as large employers, while Edmonton’s suburban fringes (e.g. [[Fort Saskatchewan]], [[Nisku, Alberta|Nisku]], [[Strathcona County]] ([[Refinery Row (Edmonton)|Refinery Row]]), [[Leduc, Alberta|Leduc]], [[Beaumont, Alberta|Beaumont]], [[Acheson, Alberta|Acheson]]) are home to most of the province’s manufacturing (much of it related to oil and gas).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edmontonjournal.com/business/Lamphier+Edmonton+roll+lucky/7691047/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Calgary-Edmonton Corridor =====
The [[Calgary-Edmonton Corridor]] is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada. Measured from north to south, the region covers a distance of roughly {{convert|400|km}}. In 2001, the population of the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor was 2.15 million (72% of Alberta's population).&lt;ref name=&quot;CECorridor&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Highlights/Page9/Page9d_e.cfm|title=Calgary-Edmonton corridor|work=[[Statistics Canada]], 2001 Census of Population|date=2003-01-20|accessdate=2007-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of the fastest growing regions in the country. A 2003 study by [[TD Bank Financial Group]] found the corridor was the only Canadian urban centre to amass a U.S. level of wealth while maintaining a Canadian-style quality of life, offering universal health care benefits. The study found GDP per capita in the corridor was 10% above average U.S. metropolitan areas and 40% above other Canadian cities at that time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

===== Calgary–Edmonton rivalry =====
{{See also|Battle of Alberta}}
Seeing Calgary and Edmonton as part of a single economic region as the TD study did in 2003 was novel. The more traditional view had been to see the two cities as economic rivals. For example, in the 1980 both cities claimed to be the &quot;Oil Capital of Canada&quot;.

==Trends==
[[File:Leduc oil.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Leduc No. 1]] well, which blew in 1947, marked the beginning of series of petroleum-related [[economic booms]].]]
{{See also|History of Alberta|History of the petroleum industry in Canada}}

Alberta has always been an [[export-oriented economy]]. In line with [[Harold Innis]]' &quot;[[Staples Thesis]]&quot;, the economy has changed substantially as different export commodities have risen or fallen in importance. In sequence, the most important products have been: fur, wheat and beef, and oil and gas.

The development of [[transportation in Alberta]] has been crucial to its historical economic development. The [[North American fur trade]] relied on [[birch-bark canoes]], [[York boats]], and [[Red River carts]] on [[buffalo trails]] to move furs out of, and European trade goods into, the region. Immigration into the province was eased tremendously by the arrival of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s [[transcontinental line]] in 1880s. Commercial farming became viable in the area once the [[grain trade]] had developed technologies to handle the [[bulk cargo|bulk]] export of grain, especially [[hopper car]]s and [[grain elevator]]s. Oil and gas exports have been possible because of increasing [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] technology.

Prior to the 1950s, Alberta was a primarily agricultural economy, based on the export of [[grain trade|wheat]], [[beef]], and a few other [[Commodity|commodities]]. The health of economy was closely bound up with the [[price of wheat]].

In 1947 a major [[oil field]] was discovered near Edmonton. It was not the first petroleum find in Alberta, but it was large enough to significantly alter the economy of the province (and coincided with growing American demand for energy). Since that time, Alberta's economic fortunes have largely tracked the [[price of oil]], and increasingly [[natural gas prices]]. When oil prices spiked during the [[1967 Oil Embargo]], [[1973 oil crisis]], and [[1979 energy crisis]], Alberta's economy boomed. However, during the [[1980s oil glut]] Alberta's economy suffered. Alberta boomed once again during the [[2003 to 2008 world oil market chronology|2003-2008 oil price spike]]. In July 2008 the price of oil peaked and began to decline and Alberta's economy soon followed suit, with unemployment doubling within a year.  By 2009 with natural gas prices at a long-term low, Alberta's economy was in poor health compared to before, although still relatively better than many other comparable jurisdictions.  By 2012 natural gas prices were at a ten-year low, the Canadian dollar was high, and oil prices recovered until June 2014.

The spin-offs from petroleum allowed Alberta to develop many other industries. Oilpatch-related manufacturing is an obvious example, but financial services and government services have also benefited from oil money.

A comparison of the development of Alberta's less oil and gas-endowed neighbours, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, reveals the role petroleum has played. Alberta was once the smallest of the three [[Prairie Provinces]] by population in the early 20th century, but by 2009, Alberta's population was 3,632,483 or approximately three times as much as either Saskatchewan (1,023,810) or Manitoba (1,213,815).

==Employment==
Alberta's economy is a highly developed one in which most people work in services such as healthcare, government, or retail. Primary industries are also of great importance, however.

By March 2016 the unemployment rate in Alberta rose to 7.9%—&lt;ref name=&quot;finance_alberta_2016_mar_11&quot; /&gt; its &quot;highest level since April 1995 and the first time the province’s rate has surpassed the national average since December 1988.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;finance_alberta_about_2016_mar_11&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.finance.alberta.ca/aboutalberta/at-a-glance/current-economy-indicators-at-a-glance.pdf | title=Alberta Economy: Indicators at a Glance | publisher=Treasury Board and Finance Economics and Revenue Forecasting | date=March 11, 2016 | accessdate=March 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 21,200 fewer jobs than February 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;finance_alberta_2016_mar_11&quot; /&gt; The unemployment rate was expected to average 7.4% in 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;financealberta_2016_Feb&quot; /&gt;{{rp|13}} The [[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers]] (CAPP) claimed that Alberta lost 35,000 jobs in 2015—25,000 from the oil services sector and 10,000 from exploration and production.&lt;ref name=&quot;huffington_2015&quot;&gt;{{citation |title=Alberta Oilpatch Layoffs Total 35,000, Says CAPP |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/09/02/alberta-oilpatch-layoffs_n_8078660.html |work=The Huffington Post|location=Alberta  |first=Michelle |last=Butterfield |date=September 2, 2015 |accessdate=March 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Full-time employment increased by 10,000 in February 2016 after falling 20,000 in both December 2015 and January 2016.

==Sectors==

===Industry===
Alberta is the largest producer of [[petroleum|conventional crude oil]], [[synthetic crude]], [[natural gas]] and gas products in the country. Alberta is the world’s 2nd largest exporter of natural gas and the 4th largest producer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.state.ak.us/trade/2003/tad/canada/canadaalberta.htm State of Alaska - Trade Report on Alberta] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215031033/http://www.gov.state.ak.us/trade/2003/tad/canada/canadaalberta.htm |date=December 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the largest producers of [[petrochemicals]] in North America are located in central and north central Alberta. In both [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]] and [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], world class [[polyethylene]] and [[Vinyl group|vinyl]] manufacturers produce products shipped all over the world, and Edmonton's [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] provide the raw materials for a large [[petrochemical]] industry to the east of Edmonton.

The [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] (sometimes known as the Athabasca [[Tar sands]]) have estimated [[unconventional oil]] reserves approximately equal to the [[conventional oil]] reserves of the rest of the world, estimated to be {{convert|1.6|Toilbbl}}. With the development of new extraction methods such as [[steam assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD), which was developed in Alberta, bitumen and synthetic crude oil can be produced at costs close to those of conventional crude. Many companies employ both conventional [[surface mining|strip mining]] and non-conventional [[in situ]] methods to extract the [[bitumen]] from the oil sands. With current technology and at current prices, about {{convert|315|Goilbbl}} of bitumen are recoverable. [[Fort McMurray]], one of Canada's fastest growing cities, has grown enormously in recent years because of the large corporations which have taken on the task of oil production. As of late 2006 there were over $100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta.

Another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands was the price of oil. The [[oil price increases since 2003]] made it more than profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss.

Alberta's economy was negatively impacted by the [[2016 oil glut|2015-2016 oil glut]] with a record high volume of worldwide oil [[inventory|inventories]] in storage,&lt;ref name=&quot;Firzli&quot;/&gt; with global crude oil collapsing at near ten-year low prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;G&amp;M_Deloitte_2016&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters_2016_Feb16&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fortune_2016&quot;/&gt; The United States doubled its 2008 production levels mainly due to substantial improvements in [[tight oil|shale]] &quot;[[fracking]]&quot; technology, OPEC members consistently exceeded their production ceiling, and China experienced a marked slowdown in economic growth and crude oil imports.&lt;ref name=&quot;G&amp;M_Deloitte_2016&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters_2016_Feb16&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fortune_2016&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_2014&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. Oil Prices Fall Below $80 a Barrel |first=Clifford |last=Krassnov |date=November 3, 2014 |accessdate=December 13, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/business/energy-environment/us-oil-prices-fall-below-80-a-barrel.html |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=glut&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-04/opec-maintains-crude-production-as-group-defers-output-target-ihryzilb |title=OPEC Won't Cut Production to Stop Oil's Slump |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With concerted effort and support from the provincial government, several high-tech industries have found their birth in Alberta, notably patents related to interactive [[liquid-crystal display]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5448263.html Interactive display system] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215131340/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5448263.html |date=2009-02-15 }} - US Patent U.S. Patent No. 5,448,263; [http://www2.smarttech.com/st/en-US/About+Us/News+Room/Media+Releases/2002+Media+Releases.htm?guid=%7BB3BD6857-5D25-4EC7-A741-C0232368F5FE%7D U.S. Patent for Touch Sensitive Technology] - SMART Technologies&lt;/ref&gt; With a growing economy, Alberta has several financial institutions dealing with civil and private funds.

====Energy====

=====Oil and gas=====
[[Image:Alberta oil gas drilling well 023.jpg|thumb|Drilling rig in Alberta.]]
{{See also|Petroleum production in Canada|Natural gas in Canada}}

Since the early 1940s, Alberta had supplied oil and gas to the rest of Canada and the [[United States]]. The [[Athabasca River]] region produces oil for internal and external use. The [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] contain the largest proven reserves of oil in the world outside [[Saudi Arabia]]. [[Natural gas]] has been found at several points, and in 1999, the production of natural gas liquids ([[ethane]], [[propane]], and [[butane]]s) totalled {{convert|172.8|Moilbbl}}, valued at $2.27 billion. Alberta also provides 13% of all the natural gas used in the United States.

Notable gas reserves were discovered in the 1883 near Medicine Hat.&lt;ref name=&quot;energy&quot;&gt;[http://www.energy.gov.ab.ca/About_Us/984.asp Alberta Energy: Energy Facts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The town of [[Medicine Hat, Alberta|Medicine Hat]] began using gas for lighting the town, and supplying light and fuel for the people, and a number of industries using the gas for manufacturing. In fact a large glassworks was established at Redcliff. When [[Rudyard Kipling]] visited Medicine Hat he described it as the city &quot;with all hell for a basement&quot;.

======Basic statistics======
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
* In 2003, Alberta produced {{convert|629|koilbbl/d}} of conventional light, medium, and heavy crude, plus an additional {{convert|142|koilbbl/d}} of pentanes plus used for blending with heavy crude oil and bitumen to facilitate its transportation through pipelines.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Alberta. [http://www.energy.gov.ab.ca/docs/aboutus/pdfs/Alberta_Energy_Overview.pdf Energy Overview]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004154020/http://www.energy.gov.ab.ca/docs/aboutus/pdfs/Alberta_Energy_Overview.pdf |date=October 4, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Alberta exports over {{convert|1|Moilbbl/d}} of oil to US markets accounting for 10 per cent of US oil imports.
* The conventional oil resource is estimated to have approximately {{convert|1.6|Goilbbl}} of remaining established reserves.
*Conventional crude oil production (not including oil sands and [[pentanes plus]]) represented 38.6% of Alberta ’s total crude oil and equivalent production and 25.5% of Canada’s total crude oil and equivalent production.
*Alberta's oil sands reserve is considered to be one of the largest in the world, containing {{convert|1.6|Toilbbl}} of bitumen initially in place. Of this total, {{convert|174.5|Goilbbl}} are considered to be remaining established reserves, recoverable using current technology under present and anticipated economic conditions. To date, about 2% of the initial established resource has been produced.
* In 2003, total crude bitumen production in Alberta averaged {{convert|964|koilbbl/d}}.
* Disposition of Alberta ’s total crude oil and equivalent production in 2003 was approximately:
** 62% to the United States
** 24% within Alberta
** 14% to the rest of Canada
* In 2003, Alberta produced {{convert|4.97|Tcuft}} of marketable natural gas.
* The average Albertan household uses {{convert|135|GJ}} of natural gas a year.
* Over 80 per cent of Canada’s natural gas production is from Alberta.
* In 2006, Alberta consumed {{convert|1.45|Tcuft}} of natural gas. The rest was exported across Canada and to the United States.
* Royalties to Alberta from natural gas and its byproducts are larger than royalties from crude oil and bitumen.
* In 2006, there were 13,473 successful natural gas wells drilled in Alberta: 12,029 conventional gas wells and 1,444 [[coalbed methane]] wells
* There may be up to {{convert|500|Tcuft}} of coalbed methane in Alberta, although it is unknown how much of this gas might be recoverable.
* Alberta has one of the most extensive natural gas systems in the world as part of its energy infrastructure, with {{convert|39000|km}} of energy related [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]].

=====Coal=====
[[File:Atlas coal mine.jpg|thumb|Remains of the former Atlas Coal Mine, near Drumheller, now a [[National Historic Site of Canada]].]]
{{See also|Coal in Canada}}
Coal has been mined in Alberta since the late 19th century. Over 1800 mines have operated in Alberta since then.&lt;ref name=&quot;energy&quot; /&gt;

The coal industry was vital to the early development of several communities, especially those in the foothills and along deep river valleys where coal was close to the surface.

Alberta is still a major coal producer, every two weeks Alberta produces enough coal to fill the [[Sky Dome]] in Toronto.&lt;ref name=&quot;energy&quot; /&gt;

Much of that coal is burned in Alberta for electricity generation. Alberta uses over 25 million tonnes of coal annually to generate electricity.&lt;ref name=&quot;energy&quot; /&gt;

Alberta has vast coal resources and 70 per cent of Canada's coal reserves are located in Alberta. This amounts to 33.6 [[Gigatonnes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;energy&quot; /&gt;

Vast beds of coal are found extending for hundreds of miles, a short distance below the surface of the plains. The coal belongs to the [[Cretaceous]] beds, and while not so heavy as that of the [[Coal Measures]] in England is of excellent quality{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}. In the valley of the [[Bow River]], alongside the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], valuable beds of [[anthracite]] coal are still worked. The usual coal deposits of the area of [[bituminous]] or semi-bituminous coal. These are largely worked at [[Lethbridge]] in southern Alberta and [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]] in the centre of the province. Many other parts of the province have pits for private use.

=====Electricity=====
{{See also|Electricity policy in Alberta}}

{{As of|2016|6}}, Alberta's generating capacity was 16,261&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]],&lt;ref name=&quot;energy.alberta.ca&quot;&gt;http://www.energy.alberta.ca/electricity/682.asp&lt;/ref&gt; and Alberta has about {{convert|26000|km}} of transmission lines.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aeso.ca/grid/about-the-grid/&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberta has 1491 megawatts of [[wind power]] capacity.&lt;ref name=&quot;energy.alberta.ca&quot;/&gt;

====Mineral mining====

Building stones mined in Alberta include [[Rundle stone]], and [[Paskapoo sandstone]].

Diamonds were first found in Alberta in 1958, and many stones have been found since, although to date no large-scale mines have been developed.&lt;ref name=&quot;energy&quot; /&gt;

====Manufacturing====
The Edmonton area, and in particular [[Nisku, Alberta|Nisku]] is a major centre for manufacturing oil and gas related equipment. As well Edmonton's [[Refinery Row (Edmonton)|Refinery Row]] is home to a petrochemical industry.

According to a Statistics Canada report Alberta's manufacturing sales year-over-year sales fell 13.2 per cent, with a loss of almost four per cent from December to January. Alberta's economy continued to shrink because of the collapse of the oil and gas sector. The petroleum and coal product manufacturing industry is now third— behind food and chemicals.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC_manufacturing_2016&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/alberta-manufacturing-sales-1.3493988 | title=Alberta manufacturing sales plunge 13% in year as most provinces see upswing StatsCan says sales rose in 16 of 21 industries across Canada while Alberta saw 4% drop last month | publisher=CBC | date=March 16, 2016 | accessdate=March 16, 2016 | author=Gibson,  John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Biotechnology====
Several companies and services in the biotech sector are clustered around the University of Alberta, for example [[ColdFX]].

====Food processing====
Owing to the strength of agriculture, food processing was once a major part of the economies of Edmonton and Calgary, but this sector has increasingly moved to smaller centres such as [[Brooks, Alberta|Brooks]], the home of [[XL Foods]], responsible for one third of Canada's beef processing in 2011.

====Transportation====
[[File:WestJetHQ.jpg|thumb|400px|Headquarters of the airline [[WestJet]], in Calgary.]]
Edmonton is a major distribution centre for northern communities, hence the nickname &quot;Gateway to the North&quot;. Edmonton is one [[CN Rail]]'s most important hubs. Since 1996, [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] has its headquarters in downtown Calgary.

[[WestJet]], Canada's second largest air carrier, is headquartered in Calgary, by [[Calgary International Airport]], which serves as the airline's primary hub.&lt;ref&gt;[http://c3dsp.westjet.com/guest/contacts/contactUs.jsp;jsessionid=g7RhKJ4H9Rvpn1VJBLFv4GZpJFpLFY1THj2vRHZJPSdwKyRB1mPG!-1091378010 Contact Us]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

===Agriculture and forestry===
[[Image:Grain Elevator 047.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Grain elevator in [[southern Alberta]]]]

==== Agriculture ====
{{See also|Agriculture in Canada}}
In the past, [[cattle]], [[horse]]s, and [[domestic sheep|sheep]] were reared in the southern prairie region on ranches or smaller holdings. Currently Alberta produces cattle valued at over $3.3 billion, as well as other livestock in lesser quantities. In this region [[irrigation]] is widely used.  [[Wheat]], accounting for almost half of the $2 billion agricultural economy, is supplemented by [[canola]], [[barley]], [[rye]], [[sugar beets]], and other mixed farming. In 2011, Alberta producers seeded an estimated total of {{convert|17900000000|acres}} to [[spring wheat]], [[durum]], barley, oats, [[mixed grains]], [[triticale]], canola and [[dry peas]].  Of the total seeded area, 94 per cent was harvested as grains and [[oilseeds]] and six per cent as [[greenfeed]] and [[silage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/sdd14009 |title=Alberta 2011 Greenfeed and Silage Production Survey Results |date=2011 |work=Department of Agriculture, Government of Alberta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Agriculture]] has a significant position in the province's economy. Over three million [[cattle]] are residents of the province at one time or another,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/rsb11006 |title=Alberta Livestock Inspections |date=August 2006 |work=Department of Agriculture, Government of Alberta}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Albertan beef has a healthy worldwide market. Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta. Alberta is one of the prime producers of plains [[American Bison|buffalo (bison)]] for the consumer market. [[domestic sheep|Sheep]] for [[wool]] and [[Lamb (food)|lamb]] are also [[sheep farm|raised]].

[[Wheat]] and [[canola]] are primary farm crops, with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production, with other [[cereal|grains]] also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation. Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion. Across the province, the once common [[grain elevator]] is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreased and farmers now truck the grain to central points.

Alberta is the leading [[beekeeping]] province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering [[Beehive (beekeeping)|hive]]s indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the [[Peace River (Alberta)|Peace River]] valley where the season is short but the working days are long for [[Western honey bee|honeybee]]s to produce honey from [[clover]] and [[fireweed]]. [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrid]] [[canola]] also requires [[bee]] [[pollination]], and some beekeepers service this need.

==== Forestry ====
{{see also|Pulp and paper industry in Canada|Alberta Forest Products Association}}

The vast northern [[forest]] reserves of [[softwood]] allow Alberta to produce large quantities of [[lumber]], [[Oriented strand board|oriented strand board (OSB)]] and [[plywood]], and several plants in northern Alberta supply North America and the [[Pacific Rim]] [[nation]]s with bleached [[wood pulp]] and [[newsprint]].

In 1999, [[lumber]] products from Alberta were valued at $4.1 billion of which 72% were exported around the world. Since forests cover approximately 59% of the province's land area, the government allows about {{convert|23.3|e6m3}} to be harvested annually from the forests on public lands.

===Services===
Despite the high profile of the extractive industries, Alberta has a mature economy and most people work in services. In 2014 there were 1,635.8 thousand people employed in the services-producing sector. By January 2016 that number had increased to 1,668.5 thousand and by February 2016 to 1,670.6 thousand.&lt;ref name=&quot;statcan_2016_services&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/labr67j-eng.htm | title=Employment by major industry group, seasonally adjusted, by province (monthly)  (Alberta) | publisher=Statistics Canada | date=March 11, 2016 | accessdate=March 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes wholesale and retail trade; transportation and warehousing; finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing; professional, scientific and technical services; business, building and other support services; educational services; health care and social assistance; information, culture and recreation; accommodation and food services; other services (except public administration) and public administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;statcan_2016_services&quot; /&gt;

====Finance====
The [[TSX Venture Exchange]] is headquartered in Calgary, and Calgary also has a robust service industry relating to the [[Security (finance)|securities]] market. The city has the second highest number of corporate head offices in Canada after Toronto, and the financial services industry in Calgary has developed to support them.

Edmonton hosts the headquarters of the only major Canadian banks west of Toronto: [[Canadian Western Bank]], and [[ATB Financial]], as well as the only province-wide [[credit union]], [[Servus]].
