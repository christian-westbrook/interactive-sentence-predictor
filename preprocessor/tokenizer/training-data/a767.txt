Aquaculture involves cultivating freshwater and saltwater populations under controlled conditions, and can be contrasted with [[commercial fishing]], which is the harvesting of [[wild fish]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AmericanHeritageDef&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/aquaculture%7ctitle=aquaculture%7cwork=Answers.com|title=Answers - The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|work=Answers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mariculture]] refers to aquaculture practiced in marine environments and in underwater habitats.

According to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) ]], aquaculture &quot;is understood to mean the farming of aquatic organisms including fish, molluscs, crustaceans and aquatic plants. Farming implies some form of intervention in the rearing process to enhance production, such as regular stocking, feeding, protection from predators, etc. Farming also implies individual or corporate ownership of the stock being cultivated.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/global-aquaculture-production/en Global Aquaculture Production] Fishery Statistical Collections, FAO, Rome.

Particular kinds of aquaculture include [[fish farming]], [[shrimp farm]]ing, [[oyster farming]], [[mariculture]], [[algaculture]] (such as [[seaweed farming]]), and the cultivation of [[ornamental fish]]. Particular methods include [[aquaponics]] and [[integrated multi-trophic aquaculture]], both of which integrate fish farming and plant farming.

In 1859, Stephen Ainsworth of [[West Bloomfield, New York]], began experiments with [[brook trout]]. By 1864, Seth Green had established a commercial fish-hatching operation at Caledonia Springs, near [[Rochester, New York]]. By 1866, with the involvement of Dr. W. W.

By the 1920s, the American Fish Culture Company of [[Carolina, Rhode Island]], founded in the 1870s was one of the leading producers of trout.  During the 1940s, they had perfected the method of manipulating the day and night cycle of fish so that they could be artificially spawned year around.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael A. Rice|Rice, M.A.]] 2010.

==21st-century practice==

Harvest stagnation in [[wild fisheries]] and [[overexploitation]] of popular marine species, combined with a growing demand for high-quality protein, encouraged aquaculturists to domesticate other marine species.&lt;ref&gt;

Concerned about the impact of growing demand for seafood on the world's oceans, prominent ocean explorer [[Jacques Cousteau]] wrote in 1973: &quot;With earth’s burgeoning human populations to feed, we must turn to the sea with new understanding and new technology.”&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Jacques Cousteau, ''The Ocean World of Jacques Cousteau: The Act of life'', World Pub: 1973.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

About 430 (97%) of the species cultured as of 2007 were domesticated during the 20th and 21st centuries, of which an estimated 106 came in the decade to 2007. Given the long-term importance of agriculture,  to date, only 0.08% of known land plant species and 0.0002% of known land animal species have been domesticated, compared with 0.17% of known marine plant species and 0.13% of known marine animal species.

Another recent issue following the banning in 2008 of organotins by the International Maritime Organization is the need to find environmentally friendly, but still effective, compounds with antifouling effects.

Many new natural compounds are discovered every year, but producing them on a large enough scale for commercial purposes is almost impossible.

===Aquatic plants===
[[File:Yangzhuanghe - CIMG3404.JPG|thumb|right|Cultivating emergent aquatic plants in floating containers]]
{{See also|Algaculture|Seaweed farming}}

[[Microalgae]], also referred to as [[phytoplankton]], [[microphytes]], or [[planktonic algae]], constitute the majority of cultivated [[algae]]. Macroalgae commonly known as [[seaweed]] also have many commercial and industrial uses, but due to their size and specific requirements, they are not easily cultivated on a large scale and are most often taken in the wild.

===Fish===
{{Main|Fish farming}}
The farming of fish is the most common form of aquaculture. It involves raising fish commercially in tanks, [[fish pond]]s, or ocean enclosures, usually for food. A facility that releases juvenile fish into the wild for recreational fishing or to supplement a species' natural numbers is generally referred to as a fish [[hatchery]]. Worldwide, the most important fish species used in fish farming are, in order, [[carp]], [[salmon]], [[tilapia]], and [[catfish]].&lt;ref name=&quot;faostat&quot; /&gt;

In the Mediterranean, young [[Atlantic bluefin tuna|bluefin tuna]] are netted at sea and towed slowly towards the shore. They are then interned in [[Offshore aquaculture|offshore]] pens where they are further grown for the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1641/0006-3568(2005)055[0301:DWSTBF]2.0.CO;2 | author = Volpe, J. | year = 2005 | title = Dollars without sense: The bait for big-money tuna ranching around the world | url = | journal = [[BioScience]] | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 301–302 | issn = 0006-3568 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, researchers in Australia managed for the first time to coax [[southern bluefin tuna]] to breed in landlocked tanks. Southern bluefin tuna are also caught in the wild and fattened in grow-out sea cages in southern [[Spencer Gulf]], [[South Australia]].

A similar process is used in the salmon-farming section of this industry; juveniles are taken from hatcheries and a variety of methods are used to aid them in their maturation. For example, as stated above, some of the most important fish species in the industry, salmon, can be grown using a cage system. This is done by having netted cages, preferably in open water that has a strong flow, and feeding the salmon a special food mixture that aids their growth. This process allows for year-round growth of the fish, thus a higher harvest during the correct seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Farming the Sea|first=Frank|last=Asche|journal=Marine Resource Economics|volume=23|issue=4|year=2008|pages=527–547 |jstor=42629678|doi=10.1086/mre.23.4.42629678}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Future Seascapes, Fishing, and Fish Farming|first=Rebecca |last=Goldburg |first2=Rosamond |last2=Naylor|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|volume=3|issue=1|date=February 2005|pages=21–28|doi=10.2307/3868441|jstor=3868441}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional method, known sometimes as sea ranching, has also been used within the industry. Sea ranching involves raising fish in a [[hatchery]] for a brief time and then releasing them into marine waters for further development, whereupon the fish are recaptured when they have matured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=E.

===Crustaceans===
{{See also|Shrimp farming|Freshwater prawn farming}}
Commercial [[shrimp]] farming began in the 1970s, and production grew steeply thereafter. Global production reached more than 1.6 million tonnes in 2003, worth about [[United States dollar|US$]]9 billion. About 75% of farmed shrimp is produced in Asia, in particular in China and Thailand. The other 25% is produced mainly in Latin America, where Brazil is the largest producer. Thailand is the largest exporter.

Shrimp farming has changed from its traditional, small-scale form in Southeast Asia into a global industry. Technological advances have led to ever higher densities per unit area, and [[broodstock]] is shipped worldwide. Virtually all farmed shrimp are [[penaeid]]s (i.e., shrimp of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Penaeidae]]), and just two species of shrimp, the [[Whiteleg shrimp|Pacific white shrimp]] and the [[giant tiger prawn]], account for about 80% of all farmed shrimp. These industrial [[monoculture]]s are very susceptible to disease, which has decimated shrimp populations across entire regions. Increasing [[ecology|ecological]] problems, repeated disease outbreaks, and pressure and criticism from both [[nongovernmental organization]]s and consumer countries led to changes in the industry in the late 1990s and generally stronger regulations. In 1999, governments, industry representatives, and environmental organizations initiated a program aimed at developing and promoting more [[sustainable agriculture|sustainable farming]] practices through the [[Seafood Watch]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Seafood Watch|url=http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/sfw_aboutsfw.aspx?c=ln|publisher=Monterey Bay Aquarium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freshwater prawn farm]]ing shares many characteristics with, including many problems with, marine shrimp farming. Unique problems are introduced by the developmental lifecycle of the main species, the [[giant river prawn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;freshwater&quot;&gt;New, M. B.: ''[http://library.enaca.org/Shrimp/Publications/FAO_Macrobrachium_manual_2003.pdf Farming Freshwater Prawns]''; FAO Fisheries Technical Paper 428, 2002. {{ISSN|0429-9345}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The global annual production of freshwater prawns (excluding [[crayfish]] and [[crab]]s) in 2003 was about 280,000 [[tonne]]s, of which China produced 180,000 tonnes followed by India and Thailand with 35,000 tonnes each. Additionally, China produced about 370,000 tonnes of [[Chinese river crab]].&lt;ref name=&quot;figis_fresh&quot;&gt;Data extracted from the [http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/static?dom=collection&amp;xml=global-aquaculture-production.xml FAO Fisheries Global Aquaculture Production Database] for freshwater crustaceans.

===Molluscs===
[[File:Abalone-farm1web.jpg|thumb|right|Abalone farm]]
{{See also|Oyster farming|Geoduck aquaculture}}
Aquacultured shellfish include various [[oyster]], [[mussel]], and  clam species. These bivalves are filter and/or deposit feeders, which rely on ambient primary production rather than inputs of fish or other feed. As such, shellfish aquaculture is generally perceived as benign or even beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;Burkholder, J.M. and S.E. Shumway. 2011. Bivalve shellfish aquaculture and eutrophication. In, Shellfish Aquaculture and the Environment. Ed. S.E. Shumway. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the species and local conditions, bivalve molluscs are either grown on the beach, on longlines, or suspended from rafts and harvested by hand or by dredging. In May 2017 a Belgian consortium installed the first of two trial mussel farms on a wind farm in the [[North Sea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;offshorewind.biz2017-06-02belgians&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The ranch is based on an artificial reef made up of 5000 ({{as of|2016|April}}) separate concrete units called ''abitats'' (abalone habitats). The 900&amp;nbsp;kg abitats can host 400 abalone each. The reef is seeded with young abalone from an onshore hatchery. The abalone feed on seaweed that has grown naturally on the abitats, with the ecosystem enrichment of the bay also resulting in growing numbers of dhufish, pink snapper, wrasse, and Samson fish, among other species.

Brad Adams, from the company, has emphasised the similarity to wild abalone and the difference from shore-based aquaculture. &quot;We're not aquaculture, we're ranching, because once they're in the water they look after themselves.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;abc.net.au-2014-08-15&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Aquaculture is an especially important economic activity in China. Between 1980 and 1997, the Chinese Bureau of Fisheries reports, aquaculture harvests grew at an annual rate of 16.7%, jumping from 1.9 million tonnes to nearly 23 million tonnes. In 2005, China accounted for 70% of world production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.05/fish.html|title=Wired 12.05: The Bluewater Revolution|work=wired.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A31159-2005Jan23 | work=The Washington Post | title=Fish Farming's Bounty Isn't Without Barbs | first=Juliet | last=Eilperin | date=2005-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquaculture is also currently one of the fastest-growing areas of food production in the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;providence1&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040820172559/http://www.providence.edu/polisci/students/aquaculture/EnvironmentalImpact.html Environmental Impact of Aquaculture]&lt;/ref&gt;

About 90% of all U.S. shrimp consumption is farmed and imported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5600e/y5600e00.HTM|title=The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture|work=fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, salmon aquaculture has become a major export in southern Chile, especially in [[Puerto Montt]], Chile's fastest-growing city.

A [[Food and Agriculture Organization|United Nations]] report titled ''The State of the World Fisheries and Aquaculture'' released in May 2014 maintained fisheries and aquaculture support the livelihoods of some 60 million people in Asia and Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aquaculture2014&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Fisheries and aquaculture have good future|url=http://www.heraldglobe.com/index.php/sid/222314317/scat/9d7afd9766a94f28/ht/Fisheries-and-aquaculture-have-good-future|accessdate=27 May 2014|publisher=''Herald Globe''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National laws, regulations, and management ===
Laws governing aquaculture practices vary greatly by country&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FAO Fisheries &amp; Aquaculture - FI fact sheet search|url = http://www.fao.org/fishery/nalo/search/en|website = www.fao.org|accessdate = 2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are often not closely regulated or easily traceable. In the United States, land-based and nearshore aquaculture is regulated at the [[National Aquaculture Act of 1980|federal]] and state levels;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Aquaculture - U.S. Aquaculture Legislation Timeline|url = http://www.oceaneconomics.org/LMR/Aquaculture/fedPolicy.aspx|website = www.oceaneconomics.org|accessdate = 2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, no national laws govern [[offshore aquaculture]] in U.S. [http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/eez.html exclusive economic zone] waters. In June 2011, the Department of Commerce and [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] released national aquaculture policies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Commerce and NOAA release national aquaculture policies to increase domestic seafood production, create sustainable jobs, and restore marine habitats|url = http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2011/20110609_aquaculture.html|website = www.noaanews.noaa.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; to address this issue and &quot;to meet the growing demand for healthy seafood, to create jobs in coastal communities, and restore vital ecosystems.&quot; In 2011, Congresswoman [[Lois Capps]] introduced the ''National Sustainable Offshore Aquaculture Act of 2011''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bill Summary &amp; Status  -  112th Congress (2011 - 2012)  - H.R.2373 - THOMAS (Library of Congress)|url = http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d112:10:./temp/~bd9BB5::%257C/home/LegislativeData.php?n=BSS;c=112%257C|website = thomas.loc.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;to establish a regulatory system and research program for sustainable offshore aquaculture in the United States exclusive economic zone&quot;; however, the bill was not enacted into law.

==Over-reporting==
China overwhelmingly dominates the world in reported aquaculture output,&lt;ref name=ChinaStats&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allcountries.org/china_statistics/13_22_output_of_aquatic_products.html |title=Output of Aquatic Products |work=China Statistics |accessdate=2011-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reporting a total output which is double that of the rest of the world put together. However, there are some historical issues with the accuracy of China's returns.

In 2001, the fisheries scientists Reg Watson and [[Daniel Pauly]] expressed concerns in a letter to ''Nature'', that China was over reporting its catch from wild fisheries in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=overreporting&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Watson, Reg |author2=Pauly, Daniel |year=2001 |url=http://www.mindfully.org/Water/Fish-Catch-Distortions.htm |title=Systematic distortions in world Fisheries catch trends |journal=Nature |volume=414 |issue=6863 |page=534 |doi=10.1038/35107050 |pmid=11734851 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531152626/http://www.mindfully.org/Water/Fish-Catch-Distortions.htm |archivedate=2010-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pearson | first1 = Helen | year = 2001 | title = China caught out as model shows net fall in fish | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v414/n6863/full/414477b.html | journal = Nature | volume = 414 | issue = 6863| page = 477 | doi = 10.1038/35107216 | pmid=11734811}}&lt;/ref&gt; They said that made it appear that the global catch since 1988 was increasing annually by 300,000 tonnes, whereas it was really shrinking annually by 350,000 tonnes. Watson and Pauly suggested this may be have been related to Chinese policies where state entities that monitored the economy were also tasked with increasing output. Also, until more recently, the promotion of Chinese officials was based on production increases from their own areas.&lt;ref&gt;Heilprin, John (2001) [http://www.seaaroundus.org/OtherWebsites/2001/CaliforniaFish_29Nov01.pdf Chinese Misreporting Masks Dramatic Decline In Ocean Fish Catches] ''Associated Press'', 29 November 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reville, William (2002) [http://google.com/search?q=cache:9mtEFlgr7BkJ:www.seaaroundus.org/newspapers/2002/IrishTimes_14Mar02.pdf+one-third+china+fish+world+fao&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=9&amp;gl=nz Something fishy about the figures] ''The Irish Times'', 14 Mar 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

China disputed this claim. The official [[Xinhua News Agency]] quoted Yang Jian, director general of the Agriculture Ministry's Bureau of Fisheries, as saying that China's figures were &quot;basically correct&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seaaroundus.org/OtherWebsites/2001/WorldCatch_17Dec01.pdf China disputes claim it over reports fish catch] ''Associate Press'', 17 December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[FAO]] accepted there were issues with the reliability of China's statistical returns, and for a period treated data from China, including the aquaculture data, apart from the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[FAO]] (2006) [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/a0699e/a0699e.pdf The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture (SOPHIA)], Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/FIELD/006/Y3354M/Y3354M00.HTM|title=FAO Fisheries Department - FISHERY STATISTICS: RELIABILITY AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Mariculture}}

[[Mariculture]] refers to the cultivation of marine organisms in [[seawater]], usually in sheltered coastal waters. The farming of marine fish is an example of mariculture, and so also is the farming of marine crustaceans (such as [[shrimp]]), molluscs (such as [[oyster]]s), and seaweed.

Mariculture may consist of raising the organisms on or in artificial enclosures such as in floating netted enclosures for salmon and on racks for oysters. In the case of enclosed salmon, they are fed by the operators; oysters on racks filter feed on naturally available food. Abalone have been farmed on an artificial reef consuming seaweed which grows naturally on the reef units.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc.net.au-2016-04-23&quot; /&gt;

===Integrated===
{{Main|Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture}}
[[Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture]] (IMTA) is a practice in which the byproducts (wastes) from one species are recycled to become inputs ([[fertilizer]]s, [[food]]) for another. Fed aquaculture (for example, [[fish]], [[shrimp]]) is combined with inorganic extractive and organic extractive (for example, [[shellfish]]) aquaculture to create balanced systems for environmental sustainability (biomitigation), economic stability (product diversification and risk reduction) and social acceptability (better management practices).&lt;ref name=&quot;Chopin et al. 2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chopin | first1 = T | last2 = Buschmann | first2 = AH | last3 = Halling | first3 = C | last4 = Troell | first4 = M | last5 = Kautsky | first5 = N | last6 = Neori | first6 = A | last7 = Kraemer | first7 = GP | last8 = Zertuche-Gonzalez | first8 = JA | last9 = Yarish | first9 = C | last10 = Neefus | first10 = C | year = 2001 | title = Integrating seaweeds into marine aquaculture systems: a key toward sustainability | url = | journal = Journal of Phycology | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 975–986 | doi=10.1046/j.1529-8817.2001.01137.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Multi-trophic&quot; refers to the incorporation of species from different [[trophic level|trophic]] or [[nutritional]] levels in the same system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chopin 2006&quot;&gt;Chopin T. 2006. Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture. What it is, and why you should care&amp;nbsp;... and don't confuse it with polyculture. Northern Aquaculture, Vol. 12, No. 4, July/August 2006, pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This is one potential distinction from the age-old practice of aquatic [[polyculture]], which could simply be the co-culture of different fish species from the same trophic level. In this case, these organisms may all share the same biological and chemical processes, with few [[synergy|synergistic]] benefits, which could potentially lead to significant shifts in the [[ecosystem]]. Some traditional polyculture systems may, in fact, incorporate a greater diversity of species, occupying several [[Ecological niche|niches]], as extensive cultures (low intensity, low management) within the same pond. The term &quot;integrated&quot; refers to the more intensive cultivation of the different species in proximity of each other, connected by nutrient and energy transfer through water.

Ideally, the biological and chemical processes in an IMTA system should balance. This is achieved through the appropriate selection and proportions of different species providing different ecosystem functions. The co-cultured species are typically more than just [[biofilters]]; they are harvestable crops of commercial value.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chopin 2006&quot;/&gt; A working IMTA system can result in greater total production based on mutual benefits to the co-cultured species and improved [[ecosystem health]], even if the production of individual species is lower than in a monoculture over a short term period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neori et al. 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neori | first1 = A | last2 = Chopin | first2 = T | last3 = Troell | first3 = M | last4 = Buschmann | first4 = AH | last5 = Kraemer | first5 = GP | last6 = Halling | first6 = C | last7 = Shpigel | first7 = M | last8 = Yarish | first8 = C | year = 2004 | title = Integrated aquaculture: rationale, evolution and state of the art emphasizing seaweed biofiltration in modern mariculture | url = | journal = Aquaculture | volume = 231 | issue = | pages = 361–391 | doi=10.1016/j.aquaculture.2003.11.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the term &quot;integrated aquaculture&quot; is used to describe the integration of monocultures through water transfer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neori et al. 2004&quot;/&gt; For all intents and purposes, however, the terms &quot;IMTA&quot; and &quot;integrated aquaculture&quot; differ only in their degree of descriptiveness. [[Aquaponics]], fractionated aquaculture, integrated agriculture-aquaculture systems, integrated peri-urban-aquaculture systems, and integrated fisheries-aquaculture systems are other variations of the IMTA concept.

==Netting materials==
Various materials, including [[nylon]], [[polyester]], [[polypropylene]], [[polyethylene]], plastic-coated welded [[wire]], [[rubber]], patented [[rope]] products (Spectra, Thorn-D, Dyneema), [[galvanized steel]] and [[copper]] are used for netting in aquaculture fish enclosures around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Offshore Aquaculture in the United States: Economic considerations, implications, and opportunities, U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration, July 2008, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Braithwaite&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=15596168|year=2005|last1=Braithwaite|first1=RA|last2=McEvoy|first2=LA|title=Marine biofouling on fish farms and its remediation|volume=47|pages=215–52|doi=10.1016/S0065-2881(04)47003-5|journal=Advances in marine biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sterlingnets.com/fishfarm.html |title=Commercial and research fish farming and aquaculture netting and supplies |publisher=Sterlingnets.com |accessdate=2010-06-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100726100545/http://www.sterlingnets.com/fishfarm.html| archivedate= 26 July 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrialnetting.com/aquaculture.htm |title=Aquaculture Netting by Industrial Netting |publisher=Industrialnetting.com |accessdate=2010-06-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529033431/http://www.industrialnetting.com/aquaculture.htm |archivedate=29 May 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Southern Regional Aquaculture Center at http://aquanic.org/publicat/usda_rac/efs/srac/162fs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; All of these materials are selected for a variety of reasons, including design feasibility, [[material strength]], cost, and [[corrosion resistance]].

{{Main|Copper alloys in aquaculture}}
Recently, copper alloys have become important netting materials in aquaculture because they are antimicrobial (i.e., they destroy [[bacteria]], [[viruses]], [[fungi]], [[algae]], and other [[microbes]]) and they therefore prevent [[biofouling]] (i.e.,  the undesirable accumulation, adhesion, and growth of microorganisms, plants, algae, tubeworms, barnacles, mollusks, and other organisms). By inhibiting microbial growth, copper alloy aquaculture cages avoid costly net changes that are necessary with other materials. The resistance of organism growth on copper alloy nets also provides a cleaner and healthier environment for farmed fish to grow and thrive.

==Issues==
{{See also|Aquaculture of salmon#Issues|l1=Issues with salmon aquaculture}}
If performed without consideration for potential local environmental impacts, aquaculture in inland waters can result in more environmental damaging than [[wild fisheries of the world|wild fisheries]], though with less waste produced on a per kg on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared, ''Collapse: How societies choose to fail or succeed,'' Viking Press, 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;479–485&lt;/ref&gt; Local concerns with aquaculture in inland waters may include waste handling, side-effects of [[antibiotic]]s, competition between farmed and wild animals, and the potential introduction of [[invasive species|invasive plant and animal species]], or foreign pathogens, particularly if unprocessed fish are used to feed more marketable [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] fish. If non-local live feeds are used, aquaculture may introduce plant of animal.  Improvements in methods resulting from advances in research and the availability of commercial feeds has reduced some of these concerns since their greater prevalence in 1990s and 2000s .&lt;ref&gt;Costa-Pierce, B.A., 2002, ''Ecological Aquaculture,'' Blackwell Science, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2112298-food-made-from-natural-gas-will-soon-feed-farm-animals-and-us/|title=Food made from natural gas will soon feed farm animals – and us|last=le Page|first=Michael|date=2016-11-10|work=|newspaper=New Scientist|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish waste is organic and composed of nutrients necessary in all components of aquatic food webs. In-ocean aquaculture often produces much higher {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} than normal fish waste concentrations. The waste collects on the ocean bottom, damaging or eliminating bottom-dwelling life. Waste can also decrease [[dissolved oxygen]] levels in the [[water column]], putting further pressure on wild animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://0-pubs.acs.org.catalog.llu.edu/doi/pdf/10.1021/es0626988 Thacker P, (June 2008) ''Fish Farms Harm Local Food Supply,'' Environmental Science and Technology, V. 40, Issue 11, pp 3445–3446]&lt;/ref&gt;  An alternative model to food being added to the ecosystem, is the installation of artificial reef structures to increase the habitat niches available, without the need to add any more than ambient feed and nutrient. This has been used in the &quot;ranching&quot; of abalone in Western Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc.net.au-2016-04-23&quot; /&gt;

===Fish oils===
{{further|Tilapia#Nutrition}}

Tilapia from aquaculture has been shown to contain more fat and a much higher ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 oils.

===Impacts on wild fish===
Some carnivorous and omnivorous farmed fish species are fed wild [[forage fish]]. Although carnivorous farmed fish represented only 13 percent of aquaculture production by weight in 2000, they represented 34 percent of aquaculture production by value.&lt;ref&gt;[[FAO]]: [http://www.fao.org/3/a-y4490e/y4490E01.pdf Aquaculture Production Trends Analysis (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Farming of carnivorous species like salmon and shrimp leads to a high demand for forage fish to match the nutrition they get in the wild. Fish do not actually produce omega-3 fatty acids, but instead accumulate them from either consuming [[microalgae]] that produce these fatty acids, as is the case with forage fish like [[herring]] and [[sardine]]s, or, as is the case with fatty [[predatory fish]], like salmon, by eating [[prey fish]] that have accumulated [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s from microalgae. To satisfy this requirement, more than 50 percent of the world [[fish oil]] production is fed to farmed salmon.&lt;ref&gt;[[FAO]]: World Review of Fisheries and Aquaculture 2008: [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/011/i0250e/i0250e03.pdf Highlights of Special Studies] Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;

Farmed salmon consume more [[wild fish]] than they generate as a final product, although the efficiency of production is improving. To produce one pound of farmed salmon, products from several pounds of wild fish are fed to them - this can be described as the &quot;fish-in-fish-out&quot; (FIFO) ratio. In 1995, salmon had a FIFO ratio of 7.5 (meaning 7.5 pounds of wild fish feed were required to produce 1 pound of salmon); by 2006 the ratio had fallen to 4.9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tacon | first1 =  | last2 = Metian | first2 =  | year = 2008 | title = Global overview on the use of fish meal and fish oil in industrially compounded aquafeeds: Trends and future prospects | url = http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/aquaculture/docs/feeds/tacon_etal_global_fishmealoil_overview_2008.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Aquaculture | volume = 285 | issue = | pages = 146–158 | doi=10.1016/j.aquaculture.2008.08.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a growing share of fish oil and fishmeal come from residues (byproducts of fish processing), rather than dedicated whole fish. In 2012, 34 percent of fish oil and 28 percent of fishmeal came from residues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/agriculture-and-food/oecd-fao-agricultural-outlook-2014_agr_outlook-2014-en#page191 |title=OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook |year=2014 |publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, fishmeal and oil from residues instead of whole fish have a different composition with more ash and less protein, which may limit its potential use for aquaculture.

As the salmon farming industry expands, it requires more wild forage fish for feed, at a time when seventy five percent of the worlds monitored fisheries are already near to or have exceeded their [[maximum sustainable yield]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Alliance&quot;&gt;[[Seafood Choices Alliance]] (2005) [http://www.seafoodchoices.com/resources/afishianado_pdfs/Salmon_Spring05.pdf It's all about salmon]&lt;/ref&gt; The industrial scale extraction of wild forage fish for salmon farming then impacts the survivability of the wild predator fish who rely on them for food. An important step in reducing the impact of aquaculture on wild fish is shifting carnivorous species to plant-based feeds. Salmon feeds, for example, have gone from containing only fishmeal and oil to containing 40 percent plant protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Torrissen | first1 =  | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2011 | title = Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar): The &quot;Super-Chicken&quot; of the Sea? | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10641262.2011.597890#.VgSGaY9VhHw | journal = Reviews in Fisheries Science | volume = 19 | issue = | page = 3 | doi=10.1080/10641262.2011.597890}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USDA has also experimented with using grain-based feeds for farmed [[trout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/Main/docs.htm?docid=21897|title=USDA Grains Project|publisher=USDA ARS}}&lt;/ref&gt; When properly formulated (and often mixed with fishmeal or oil), plant-based feeds can provide proper nutrition and similar growth rates in carnivorous farmed fish.&lt;ref&gt;NOAA/USDA: [http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/aquaculture/docs/feeds/the_future_of_aquafeeds_final.pdf The Future of Aquafeeds] (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another impact aquaculture production can have on wild fish is the risk of fish escaping from coastal pens, where they can interbreed with their wild counterparts, diluting wild genetic stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidsuzuki.org/Oceans/Aquaculture/Salmon/%7ctitle=Oceans%7cwork=davidsuzuki.org|title=Oceans|work=davidsuzuki.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escaped fish can become [[invasive species|invasive]], out-competing native species.&lt;ref&gt;

==== Pollution from sea cage aquaculture ====
[[Aquaculture of salmon|Salmon farms]] are typically sited in pristine coastal ecosystems which they then pollute. A farm with 200,000 salmon discharges more fecal waste than a city of 60,000 people. This waste is discharged directly into the surrounding aquatic environment, untreated, often containing antibiotics and [[pesticide]]s.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alliance&quot;/&gt; There is also an accumulation of [[heavy metals]] on the [[benthos]] (seafloor) near the salmon farms, particularly [[copper]] and [[zinc]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO coho&quot;&gt;

In 2016, mass fish kill events impacted salmon farmers along Chile's coast and the wider ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/10/chiles-salmon-farms-lose-800m-as-algal-bloom-kills-millions-of-fish|title=Chile's salmon farms lose $800m as algal bloom kills millions of fish|last=Reuters|date=2016-03-10|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increases in aquaculture production and its associated effluent were considered to be possible contributing factors to fish and molluscan mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-04/wave-of-dead-sea-creatures-hits-chile-beaches/7384576|title=Wave of dead sea creatures hits Chile's beaches|date=2016-05-04|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sea cage aquaculture is responsible for nutrient enrichment of the waters in which they are established. This results from fish wastes and uneaten feed inputs. Elements of most concern are nitrogen and phosphorus which can promote algal growth, including harmful algal blooms which can be toxic to fish. Flushing times, current speeds, distance from the shore and water depth are important considerations when locating sea cages in order to minimize the impacts of nutrient enrichment on coastal ecosystems.

The extent of the effects of pollution from sea-cage aquaculture varies depending on where the cages are located, which species are kept, how densely cages are stocked and what the fish are fed. Important species-specific variables include the species' food conversion ratio (FCR) and nitrogen retention. Studies prior to 2001 determined that the amount of nitrogen introduced as feed which is lost to the water column and seafloor as waste varies from 52 to 95%.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Genetic modification===
A type of salmon called the AquAdvantage salmon has been [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified]] for faster growth, although it has not been approved for commercial use, due to controversy.&lt;ref&gt;

==Animal welfare==
{{see also|Pain in fish|Pain in invertebrates}}
As with the farming of terrestrial animals, social attitudes influence the need for humane practices and regulations in farmed marine animals.  Under the guidelines advised by the [[Farm Animal Welfare Council]] good animal welfare means both fitness and a sense of well being in the animal's physical and mental state. This can be defined by the [[Five Freedoms]]:
* Freedom from hunger &amp; thirst
* Freedom from discomfort
* Freedom from pain, disease, or injury
* Freedom to express normal behaviour
* Freedom from fear and distress

However, the controversial issue in aquaculture is whether fish and farmed marine invertebrates are actually [[sentient]], or have the perception and awareness to experience suffering. Although no evidence of this has been found in marine invertebrates,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hastein&quot;&gt;Hastein, T., Scarfe, A.D. and Lund, V.L. (2005) Science-based assessment of welfare: Aquatic animals. Rev. Sci. Tech. Off. Int. Epiz 24 (2) 529-547&lt;/ref&gt; recent studies conclude that fish do have the necessary receptors ([[nociceptors]]) to sense noxious stimuli and so are likely to experience states of pain, fear and stress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hastein&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandroo, K.P., Duncan, I.J.H. and Moccia, R.D. (2004) &quot;Can fish suffer?: Perspectives on sentience, pain, fear and stress.&quot; ''Applied Animal Behaviour Science'' 86 (3,4) 225-250&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, welfare in aquaculture is directed at vertebrates; finfish in particular.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conte&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conte | first1 = F.S. | year = 2004 | title = Stress and the welfare of cultured fish | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 86 | issue = 3–4| pages = 205–223 | doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2004.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common welfare concerns===
Welfare in aquaculture can be impacted by a number of issues such as stocking densities, behavioural interactions, [[fish diseases and parasites#Disease|disease]] and [[fish diseases and parasites#Parasites|parasitism]]. A major problem in determining the cause of impaired welfare is that these issues are often all interrelated and influence each other at different times.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huntingford&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Adams|first2=C.|last3=Braithwaite|first3=V.

A.}}&lt;!-- also here: http://www.senasa.gov.ar/Archivos/File/File3393-huntingford2006.pdf --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Optimal stocking density is often defined by the [[carrying capacity]] of the stocked environment and the amount of individual space needed by the fish, which is very species specific. Although behavioural interactions such as [[shoaling and schooling|shoaling]] may mean that high stocking densities are beneficial to some species,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hastein&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashley&quot;&gt;Ashley, P.J. (2006) Fish welfare: Current issues in aquaculture. Applied Animal Behaviour Science, {{doi|10.1016/j.applanim.2006.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; in many cultured species high stocking densities may be of concern. Crowding can constrain normal swimming behaviour, as well as increase aggressive and competitive behaviours such as cannibalism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baras E, Jobling M |year=2002 |title=Dynamics of intracohort cannibalism in cultured fish |journal=Aquaculture Research |volume=33 |issue=7 |pages=461–479 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2109.2002.00732.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; feed competition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Greaves K. |author2=Tuene S. | year = 2001 | title = The form and context of aggressive behaviour in farmed Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus L.) | url = | journal = Aquaculture | volume = 193 | issue = 1–2| pages = 139–147 | doi = 10.1016/S0044-8486(00)00476-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; territoriality and dominance/subordination hierarchies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellis&quot; /&gt; This potentially increases the risk of tissue damage due to abrasion from fish-to-fish contact or fish-to-cage contact.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hastein&quot; /&gt; Fish can suffer reductions in food intake and [[feed conversion ratio|food conversion efficiency]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellis&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ellis T. |author2=North B. |author3=Scott A.P. |author4=Bromage N.R. |author5=Porter M. |author6=Gadd D. | year = 2002 | title = The relationships between stocking density and welfare in farmed rainbow trout | url = | journal = Journal of Fish Biology | volume = 61 | issue = 3| pages = 493–531 | doi = 10.1111/j.1095-8649.2002.tb00893.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, high stocking densities can result in water flow being insufficient, creating inadequate oxygen supply and waste product removal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashley&quot; /&gt; [[Dissolved oxygen]] is essential for fish respiration and concentrations below critical levels can induce stress and even lead to [[asphyxiation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellis&quot; /&gt; Ammonia, a nitrogen excretion product, is highly toxic to fish at accumulated levels, particularly when oxygen concentrations are low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Remen M. |author2=Imsland A.K. |author3=Steffansson S.O. |author4=Jonassen T.M. |author5=Foss A. | year = 2008 | title = Interactive effects of ammonia and oxygen on growth and physiological status of juvenile Atlantic cod (''Gadus morhua'') | url = | journal = Aquaculture | volume = 274 | issue = 2–4| pages = 292–299 | doi = 10.1016/j.aquaculture.2007.11.032 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these interactions and effects cause stress in the fish, which can be a major factor in facilitating fish disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conte&quot; /&gt; For many parasites, infestation depends on the host's degree of mobility, the density of the host population and vulnerability of the host's defence system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Paperna I | year = 1991 | title = Diseases caused by parasites in the aquaculture of warm water fish | url = | journal = Annual Review of Fish Diseases | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 155–194 | doi = 10.1016/0959-8030(91)90028-I }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sea lice are the primary parasitic problem for finfish in aquaculture, high numbers causing widespread skin erosion and haemorrhaging, gill congestion, and increased mucus production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Johnson S.C. |author2=Treasurer J.W. |author3=Bravo S. |author4=Nagasawa K. |author5=Kabata Z. | year = 2004 | title = A review of the impact of parasitic copepods on marine aquaculture | url = | journal = Zoological Studies | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 229–243 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a number of prominent viral and bacterial [[pathogen]]s that can have severe effects on internal organs and nervous systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Johansen L.H. |author2=Jensen I. |author3=Mikkelsen H. |author4=Bjorn P.A. |author5=Jansen P.A. |author6=Bergh O. | year = 2011 | title = Disease interaction and pathogens exchange between wild and farmed fish populations with special reference to Norway | url = | journal = Aquaculture | volume = 315 | issue = 3–4| pages = 167–186 | doi = 10.1016/j.aquaculture.2011.02.014 |hdl=11250/117164 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improving welfare===
The key to improving welfare of marine cultured organisms is to reduce stress to a minimum, as prolonged or repeated stress can cause a range of adverse effects. Attempts to minimise stress can occur throughout the culture process. During grow out it is important to keep stocking densities at appropriate levels specific to each species, as well as separating size classes and grading to reduce aggressive behavioural interactions. Keeping nets and cages clean can assist positive water flow to reduce the risk of water degradation.

Not surprisingly disease and parasitism can have a major effect on fish welfare and it is important for farmers not only to manage infected stock but also to apply disease prevention measures. However, prevention methods, such as vaccination, can also induce stress because of the extra handling and injection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashley&quot; /&gt; Other methods include adding antibiotics to feed, adding chemicals into water for treatment baths and biological control, such as using [[cleaner fish|cleaner wrasse]] to remove lice from farmed salmon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashley&quot; /&gt;

Many steps are involved in transport, including capture, food deprivation to reduce faecal contamination of transport water, transfer to transport vehicle via nets or pumps, plus transport and transfer to the delivery location. During transport water needs to be maintained to a high quality, with regulated temperature, sufficient oxygen and minimal waste products.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conte&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashley&quot; /&gt; In some cases [[anaesthetics]] may be used in small doses to calm fish before transport.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashley&quot; /&gt;

Aquaculture is sometimes part of an environmental rehabilitation program or as an aid in conserving endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mZ0eOg8ld5QC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=aquaculture+and+rehabilitation+and+ex-situ&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qq9b_fMvvc&amp;sig=itYIabSe1EVCbLZW3j-U99qk_fc&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0ph1T8LqJOKp0QXx3qGkDQ&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=aquaculture%20and%20rehabilitation%20and%20ex-situ&amp;f=false|title=Aquaculture Development|work=google.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prospects==
Global [[wild fisheries]] are in decline, with valuable habitat such as [[estuary|estuaries]] in critical condition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tietenberg, Tom]] (2006) ''Environmental and Natural Resource Economics: A Contemporary Approach''. Page 28. Pearson/Addison Wesley. {{ISBN|978-0-321-30504-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aquaculture or [[fish farm|farming]] of [[piscivorous]] fish, like [[salmon]], does not help the problem because they need to eat products from other fish, such as [[fish meal]] and [[fish oil]]. Studies have shown that [[Aquaculture of salmon|salmon farming]] has major [[Salmon farming issues|negative impacts]] on wild salmon, as well as the [[forage fish]] that need to be caught to feed them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salmon Run&quot;&gt;

[[Vaccine]]s are being used more and more to reduce [[antibiotic]] use for disease control.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050106122419/http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/12217/marine_aquaculture_pew_2001.pdf &quot;Pew Oceans Commission report on Aquaculture&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Onshore recirculating aquaculture systems, facilities using [[polyculture]] techniques, and properly sited facilities (for example, offshore areas with strong currents) are examples of ways to manage negative environmental effects.

[[Recirculating aquaculture systems]] (RAS) recycle water by circulating it through filters to remove fish waste and food and then recirculating it back into the tanks.  This saves water and the waste gathered can be used in [[compost]] or, in some cases, could even be treated and used on land. While RAS was developed with freshwater fish in mind, scientist associated with the [[Agricultural Research Service]] have found a way to rear saltwater fish using RAS in low-salinity waters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Growing Premium Seafood-Inland!&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/feb09/seafood0209.htm
|title=Growing Premium Seafood-Inland!
|publisher=USDA Agricultural Research Service
|date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although saltwater fish are raised in off-shore cages or caught with nets in water that typically has a salinity of 35 [[parts per thousand]] (ppt), scientists were able to produce healthy pompano, a saltwater fish, in tanks with a salinity of only 5 ppt. Commercializing low-salinity RAS are predicted to have positive environmental and economical effects. Unwanted nutrients from the fish food would not be added to the ocean and the risk of transmitting diseases between wild and farm-raised fish would greatly be reduced. The price of expensive saltwater fish, such as the pompano and combia used in the experiments, would be reduced. However, before any of this can be done researchers must study every aspect of the fish's lifecycle, including the amount of ammonia and nitrate the fish will tolerate in the water, what to feed the fish during each stage of its lifecycle, the [[stocking rate]] that will produce the healthiest fish, etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;Growing Premium Seafood-Inland!&quot;/&gt;

Brown, ''[[Plan B 2.0]] Rescuing a Planet Under Stress and a Civilization in Trouble'' (NY: W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 2006), p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;  In California, for example, 15 fish farms produce tilapia, bass, and catfish with warm water from underground. This warmer water enables fish to grow all year round and mature more quickly. Collectively these California farms produce 4.5 million kilograms of fish each year.&lt;ref name=&quot;earth-policy&quot; /&gt;
