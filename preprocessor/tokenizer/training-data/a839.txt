{{History of Jordan}}
'''Ammon''' ({{Hebrew Name|עַמּוֹן|Ammon|ʻAmmôn|&quot;People&quot;}}; {{lang-ar|عمّون|ʻAmmūn}}) was an [[Iron Age]] [[Semitic languages|Semitic-speaking]] nation occupying the east of the [[Jordan River]], between the torrent valleys of [[Wadi Mujib|Arnon]] and  [[Jabbok]], in present-day [[Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Texts Relating to the Bible: Amman Citadel|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/wsrp/educational_site/ancient_texts/Citadel.shtml|accessdate=2011-01-11|publisher=[[University of Southern California]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101126125659/http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/wsrp/educational_site/ancient_texts/Citadel.shtml| archivedate= 26 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LaBiancaYounker&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Archaeology of Society in the Holy Land |chapter=The Kingdoms of Ammon, Moab and Edom: The Archaeology of Society in Late Bronze/Iron Age Transjordan (ca. 1400–500 BCE)|editor-last=Levy |editor-first=Tom|last1=LaBianca|first1=Øystein S.|last2=Younker|first2=Randall W.|publisher=A&amp;C Black |year=1995 |page=399 |isbn=9780718513887 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TqRIlVBRv34C&amp;pg=PA399#v=onepage&amp;q=Ammon&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chief city of the country was ''[[Rabbah]]'' or ''Rabbath Ammon'', site of the modern city of [[Amman]], Jordan's capital. [[Moloch|Milcom]] and [[Moloch|Molech]] (who may be one and the same) are named in the [[Hebrew Bible]] as the gods of Ammon. The people of this kingdom are called &quot;'''Children of Ammon'''&quot; or &quot;'''Ammonites'''&quot;.

==History==
{{See|List of rulers of Ammon}}

The Ammonites occupied the northern Central Trans-Jordanian Plateau from the latter part of the second millennium B.C. to the middle of the first millennium B.C.

Ammon maintained its independence from the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] empire through tribute to the Assyrian king, at a time when nearby kingdoms were being raided or conquered.&lt;ref name=Jordan/&gt; [[Kurkh Monolith|Inscriptions describe]] the Ammonite king [[Baasha ben Ruhubi]]'s army fighting alongside [[Ahab]] of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Syria]]n allies against [[Shalmaneser III]] at the [[Battle of Qarqar]] in 853 BC, possibly as vassals of [[Hadadezer]], the Aramaean king of [[Aram Damascus|Damascus]]. In 734 BC the Ammonite king [[Sanipu]] was a vassal of [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], and Sanipu's successor [[Pudu-ilu]] held the same position under [[Sennacherib]] and [[Esarhaddon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Ammonites|volume=1|pages=863-864}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Assyrian tribute-list exists from this period, showing that Ammon paid one-fifth as much tribute as Judah did.&lt;ref&gt;See Schrader, ''K.A.T.'' pp. 141 et seq.; Delitzsch, ''Paradies,'' p. 294; Winckler, ''Geschichte Israels,'' p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

Somewhat later, the Ammonite king [[Amminadab I of Ammon|Amminadab I]] was among the tributaries who suffered in the course of the great [[Arabia]]n campaign of [[Assurbanipal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; Other kings attested to in contemporary sources are [[Barachel (Ammon)|Barachel]] (attested to in several contemporary [[seal (device)|seals]]) and [[Hissalel]], the latter of whom reigned about 620 BCE. Hissalel is mentioned in an inscription on a bottle found at [[Tel Siran]], Jordan along with his son, King [[Amminadab II of Ammon|Amminadab II]], who reigned around 600 BCE.

Archaeology and history indicate that Ammon flourished during the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] period. This contradicts the view, dominant for decades, that Transjordan was either destroyed by [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], or suffered a rapid decline following Judah's destruction by that king. Newer evidence suggests that Ammon enjoyed continuity from the Neo-Babylonian to the Persian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barstad2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Barstad, Hans M|editor1=John J. Ahn|editor2=Jill Middlemas|chapter=The City State of Jerusalem in the Neo-Babylonian Empire: Evidence from the Surrounding States|title=By the Irrigation Canals of Babylon: Approaches to the Study of the Exile|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a6eoAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42|date=18 February 2012|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-0-567-19775-7|pages=42–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little mention is made of the Ammonites through the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] and early [[Hellenistic Age|Hellenistic]] periods.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Their name appears, however, during the time of the [[Maccabees]]. The Ammonites, with some of the neighboring tribes, did their utmost to resist and check the revival of the Jewish power under [[Judas Maccabaeus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[1 Maccabees]] 5:6; cf. [[Josephus]] ''[[Jewish Antiquities]]'' xii. 8. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hasmonean dynast [[John Hyrcanus|Hyrcanus]] founded [[Qasr al Abd#History|Qasr Al Abd]], and was a descendant of the Seleucid [[Tobiad]] dynasty of [[Book of Tobit|Tobiah]], who is mentioned by Nehemiah as an Ammonite (ii. 19) from the east-Jordanian district.

The last notice of the Ammonites is in [[Justin Martyr]]'s ''Dialogue with Trypho'' (§ 119), in the second century, where it is affirmed that they were still a numerous people.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=St. Justin Martyr |title=Dialogue with Trypho|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/justinmartyr-dialoguetrypho.html|website=Early Christian Writings|publisher=Peter Kirby|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical narrative==
The first mention of the Ammonites in the Bible is in {{bibleverse||Genesis|19:37-38|NIV}}. It is stated there that they descended from Ben-Ammi, a son of [[Lot (biblical)|Lot]] through incest with his younger daughter.&lt;ref name=&quot;C&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|first=Honoré
|last=Mirabeau
|title=Erotika Biblion

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bén'ámmî, literally means &quot;''son of my people''&quot;. After the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], the daughters of Lot had sexual relations with their father, resulting in Ammon and his half brother, [[Moab]], being conceived and born. This narrative has traditionally been considered literal fact, but is now generally interpreted as recording a gross popular irony by which the Israelites expressed their loathing of the Moabites and Ammonites, although it is doubtful that the Israelites would have directed such irony to Lot himself.&lt;ref name=Fenlon&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01431b.htm Fenlon, John Francis. &quot;Ammonites.&quot; The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 14 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ammonites settled to the east of the Jordan, invading the [[Rephaim]] lands east of Jordan, between the [[Jabbok]] and [[Wadi Mujib|Arnon]], dispossessing them and dwelling in their place. Their territory originally comprising all from the Jordan to the wilderness, and from the River Jabbok south to the River Arnon. It was accounted a land of giants; and that giants formerly dwelt in it, whom the Ammonites called &quot;Zomzommims&quot;.&lt;ref name=Fenlon/&gt;

Shortly before the Israelite [[the Exodus|Exodus]], the [[Amorite]]s west of Jordan, under King [[Sihon]], invaded and occupied [[Transjordan (region)|a large portion of the territory of Moab and Ammon]]. The Ammonites were driven from the rich lands near the Jordan and retreated to the mountains and valleys to the east.&lt;ref name=Fenlon/&gt; The invasion of the Amorites created a wedge and separated the two kingdoms of Ammon and Moab.&lt;ref name=&quot;C&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bibler.org/glossary/ammon.html |title=www.Bibler.org - Dictionary - Ammon |date=2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Bible, the Ammonites and Israelites are portrayed as mutual antagonists. During the Exodus, the Israelites were prohibited by the Ammonites from passing through their lands. The Ammonites soon allied themselves with [[Eglon (king)|Eglon]] of Moab in attacking Israel.

The Ammonites maintained their claim to part of [[Transjordan (Bible)|Transjordan]], after it was occupied by the Israelites who obtained it from [[Sihon]]. During the days of [[Jephthah]], the Ammonites occupied the lands east of the River Jordan and started to invade Israelite lands west of the river. Jephthah became the leader in resisting these incursions.

The constant harassment of the Israelite communities east of the Jordan by the Ammonites was the impetus behind the unification of the tribes under [[Saul]]. King [[Nahash of Ammon]] ({{circa|1010}}{{snd}}990 BC) lay siege to [[Jabesh-Gilead]]. Eventually this led to an alliance with Saul and The Israelites, led by Saul relieved the siege and defeated the Ammonite king, eventually resulting in the formation of the Israelite Kingdom.

During the reign of [[King David]], the Ammonites humiliated David's messengers, and hired the Aramean armies to attack Israel. This eventually ended in a war and a year-long siege of [[Rabbah]], the capital of Ammon. The war ended with all the Ammonite cities being conquered and plundered, and the inhabitants being killed or put to forced labor at David's command.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|12:31|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|20:3|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Arameans of Damascus city-state deprived the Kingdom of Israel of their possessions east of the Jordan, the Ammonites became allies of [[Hadadezer|Ben-hadad]], and a contingent of 1,000 of them served as allies of Syria in the great [[Battle of Qarqar|battle]] of the Arameans and Assyrians at [[Qarqar]] in 854 BC in the reign of [[Shalmaneser III]].

The Ammonites, Moabites and [[Meunim]] formed a coalition against [[Jehoshaphat]] of Judah. The coalition later was thrown to confusion, with the armies slaughtering one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|20:1|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were subdued and paid tribute to Jotham.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|27:5|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After submitting to Tiglath-pileser they were generally tributary to Assyria, but have joined in the general uprising that took place under [[Sennacherib]]; but they submitted and they became tributary in the reign of [[Esar-haddon]]. Their hostility to Judah is shown in their joining the Chaldeans to destroy it ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_2kings24_sml.htm#2kings_24:2 2 Kings 24:2]). Their cruelty is denounced by the prophet Amos
([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_amos01_sml.htm#amos_1:13 Amos 1:13]), and their destruction (with their return in the future) by Jeremiah ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_jeremiah49_sml.htm#jeremiah_49:1 Jeremiah 49:1]–[http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_jeremiah49_sml.htm#jeremiah_49:6 6]); Ezekiel ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_ezekiel21_sml.htm#ezekiel_21:28 Ezekiel 21:28]–[http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_ezekiel21_sml.htm#ezekiel_21:32 32]); and Zechariah ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_zechariah02_sml.htm#zechariah_2:8 Zechariah 2:8], [http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_zechariah02_sml.htm#zechariah_2:9 9]). Their murder of Gedaliah ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_2kings25_sml.htm#2kings_25:22 2 Kings 25:22]–[http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_2kings25_sml.htm#2kings_25:26 26]; [http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_jeremiah40_sml.htm#jeremiah_40:14 Jeremiah 40:14]) was a dastardly act. They may have regained their old territory when Tiglath-pileser carried off the Israelites East of the Jordan into captivity ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_2kings15_sml.htm#2kings_15:29 2 Kings 15:29]; [http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_1chronicles05_sml.htm#1chronicles_5:26 1 Chronicles 5:26]).

Tobiah the Ammonite united with Sanballat to oppose Nehemiah ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_nehemiah04_sml.htm Nehemiah 4]), and their opposition to the Jews did not cease with the establishment of the latter in Judea.

They also joined the Syrians in their wars with the Maccabees and were defeated by Judas.&lt;ref name=&quot;C&quot; /&gt;

According to both {{bibleverse|1|Kings|14:21–31|NIV}} and {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|12:13|NIV}}, [[Naamah (wife of Solomon)|Naamah]] was an Ammonite. She was the only wife of King [[Solomon]] to be mentioned by name in the [[Tanakh]] as having borne a child. She was the mother of Solomon's successor, [[Rehoboam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The Jewish Encyclopedia|title=Naama|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1&amp;letter=N|accessdate=2007-08-05| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813035717/http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1&amp;letter=N| archivedate=13 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ammonites presented a serious problem to the [[Pharisees]] because many marriages between Israelite men and Ammonite (and Moabite) women had taken place in the days of [[Nehemiah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Nehemiah|13:23|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The men had married women of the various nations without conversion, which made the children not Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;The identity of those particular tribes had been lost during the ''mixing of the nations'' caused by the conquests of [[Assyria]]. As a result, people from those nations were treated as complete gentiles and could convert without restriction.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legitimacy of [[David]]'s claim to royalty was disputed on account of his descent from Ruth, the Moabite.&lt;ref&gt;According to Babylonian [[Talmud]], [[Doeg the Edomite]] was the source of this dispute. He claimed that since David was descended from someone who was not allowed to marry into the community, his male ancestors were no longer part of the [[tribe of Judah]] (which was the tribe the King had to belong to).  As a result, he could neither be the king, nor could he marry any Jewish woman (since he descended from a [[Moab]]ite convert). The Prophet [[Samuel]] wrote the Book of Ruth in order to remind the people of the original law that women from [[Moab]] and Ammon were allowed to convert and marry into the Jewish people immediately.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
{{Main|Ammonite language}}
The few Ammonite names that have been preserved also include Nahash and [[Hanun]], both from the Bible.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; The Ammonites' language is believed to be in the [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite family]], closely related to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Moabite language|Moabite]]. Ammonite may have incorporated certain [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] influences, including the use of ''‘bd'', instead of commoner Biblical Hebrew ''‘śh'', for &quot;work&quot;. The only other notable difference with Biblical Hebrew is the sporadic retention of feminine singular ''-t'' (e.g., ''’šħt'' &quot;cistern&quot;, but ''‘lyh'' &quot;high (fem.)&quot;.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=D (ed)|year=1988|title=Les langues dans le monde ancien et modern, part 3|chapter=Les Langues Chamito-semitiques|publisher=[[French National Centre for Scientific Research|CNRS]]|location=Paris}}{{cite book|last=Aufrecht|first=WE|title=A Corpus of Ammonite Inscriptions|isbn=0-88946-089-2|location= Lewiston|publisher=E. Mellen Press|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
The economy, for the most part, was based on agriculture and herding. Most people lived in small villages surrounded by farms and pastures. Like its sister-kingdom of Moab, Ammon was the source of numerous natural resources, including [[sandstone]] and [[limestone]]. It had a productive agricultural sector and occupied a vital place along the [[King's Highway (ancient)|King's Highway]], the ancient trade route connecting [[Egypt]] with [[Mesopotamia]], [[Syria]], and [[Asia Minor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Ammon |chapter=Review of Archaeological Research in Ammon|editor1=Burton MacDonald |editor2=Randall W. Younker |author-first=Randall W. |author-last=Younker |publisher=BRILL |year=1999 |page=1– |isbn=978-90-04-10762-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Sm7BOubDYcC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;output=html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the Edomites and Moabites, trade along this route gave them considerable revenue. Circa 950 BCE Ammon showed rising prosperity, due to [[agriculture]] and [[trade]], and built a series of fortresses. Its capital was located in what is now the Citadel of [[Amman]].&lt;ref name=Jordan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/his_testament.html|title=The Old Testament Kingdoms of Jordan|accessdate=2009-05-12| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506015442/http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/his_testament.html| archivedate=6 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==

===Inscription===
In 1972, during the excavations of a site called Tell Siran in north-west Amman, an inscription on a bronze bottle of about 10&amp;nbsp;cm tall was found. Scientific investigation has showed that the inscription dates back to 600 BC, and later concluded that it was a lyric poem written in [[Ammonite language]]. The poem talks about a drinking song, roughly translated to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reference.sabinet.co.za/webx/access/journal_archive/10318471/268.pdf|title=The Tell Siran inscription.
