==Biography==
Arabian Prince started working with [[Russ Parr|Bobby Jimmy &amp; the Critters]] in 1984. He also produced the hit single and album for [[J.J. Fad]], &quot;[[Supersonic (J.J. Fad song)|Supersonic]]&quot;.

In 1986, he was a founding member of [[N.W.A]] but when fellow member [[Ice Cube]] came back from the Phoenix Institute of Technology in 1988, Arabian Prince soon after left over royalty and contract disagreements—[[Eazy-E]], Ice Cube and [[MC Ren]] were the main performers, [[DJ Yella]] was the [[turntablist]] and [[Dr. Dre]] was the main producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/whatever-happened-to-nwas-posse-2164896|title=Whatever Happened to N.W.A's Posse?|author=Martin Cizmar|work=L.A. Weekly|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving N.W.A, Arabian Prince began a solo career. His first album, ''[[Brother Arab]]'', was released in 1989; ''[[Where's My Bytches]]'' followed in 1993.

In the mid-2000s, he started releasing music again, with his Professor X project on the Dutch label Clone Records. In 2007 he performed as a DJ on the 2K Sports Holiday Bounce Tour with artists from the [[Stones Throw]] label. In 2008, Stones Throw released a compilation of his electro-rap material from the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stonesthrow.com/arabianprince/ |title=Arabian Prince &amp;#124; Stones Throw Records |publisher=Stonesthrow.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his songs was included on the 2007 video game, ''[[College Hoops 2K8]]''.
