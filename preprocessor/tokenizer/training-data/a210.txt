'''Mouthwash''', '''mouth rinse''', '''oral rinse''' or '''mouth bath''',&lt;ref name=Matthews2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matthews|first=R W|title=Hot salt water mouth baths|journal=British Dental Journal|date=12 July 2003|volume=195|issue=1|pages=3–3|doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.4810318|url=http://www.nature.com/bdj/journal/v195/n1/full/4810318a.html|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a liquid which is held in the mouth passively or swilled around the mouth by contraction of the perioral muscles and/or movement of the head, and may be [[gargling|gargled]], where the head is tilted back and the liquid bubbled at the back of the mouth.

Usually mouthwashes are [[antiseptic]] solutions intended to reduce the microbial load in the oral cavity, although other mouthwashes might be given for other reasons such as for their [[analgesic]], [[anti-inflammatory]] or [[anti-fungal medication|anti-fungal]] action. Additionally, some rinses act as saliva substitutes to neutralize acid and keep the mouth moist in [[xerostomia]] (dry mouth).&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/there-is-more-to-your-mouthwash-than-a-minty-taste-1421096379|title=There is More to Your Mouthwash Than a Minty Taste}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=medX&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-03-mouthwash.html|title=Should I use mouthwash?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cosmetic mouthrinses temporarily control or reduce bad breath and leave the mouth with a pleasant taste.&lt;ref name=ada&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ada.org/en/science-research/ada-seal-of-acceptance/product-category-information/mouthrinses|title=Learn More About Mouthrinses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
Common use involves rinsing the mouth with about 20 [[milliliter|ml]] (2/3 [[fluid ounce|fl oz]]) of mouthwash. The wash is typically swished or gargled for about half a minute and then spat out. Most companies suggest not drinking water immediately after using mouthwash. In some brands, the [[expectorate]] is stained, so that one can see the bacteria and debris.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kozlovsky&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8794967 |year=1996 |last1=Kozlovsky |first1=A |last2=Goldberg |first2=S |last3=Natour |first3=I |last4=Rogatky-Gat |first4=A |last5=Gelernter |first5=I |last6=Rosenberg |first6=M |title=Efficacy of a 2-phase oil: Water mouthrinse in controlling oral malodor, gingivitis, and plaque |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=577–82 |journal=Journal of periodontology |doi=10.1902/jop.1996.67.6.577}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenberg1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1552460 |year=1992 |last1=Rosenberg |first1=M |last2=Gelernter |first2=I |last3=Barki |first3=M |last4=Bar-Ness |first4=R |title=Day-long reduction of oral malodor by a two-phase oil: water mouthrinse as compared to chlorhexidine and placebo rinses |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=39–43 |journal=Journal of periodontology |doi=10.1902/jop.1992.63.1.39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenberg2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=2076696 |year=1990 |last1=Rosenberg |first1=M |title=Bad breath: diagnosis and treatment |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=7-11 |journal=University of Toronto Dental Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mouthwash should not be used immediately after brushing the teeth so as not to wash away the beneficial fluoride residue left from the toothpaste. Similarly, the mouth should not be rinsed out with water after brushing. Patients were told to &quot;spit don't rinse&quot; after toothbrushing as part of a [[National Health Service]] campaign in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oral health promotion messages: &quot;Spit don't rinse&quot;|url=http://www.networks.nhs.uk/nhs-networks/healthcare-professionals-commissioning-network/messageboard/healthcare-professionals-commissioning-network-forum/795055410/562863043/oral-health-promotion-messages-doc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gargling is where the head is tilted back, allowing the mouthwash to sit in the back of the mouth while exhaling, causing the liquid to bubble. Gargling is practiced in [[Japan]] for perceived prevention of viral infection. One commonly used way is with [[infusion]]s or [[tea]]. In some cultures, gargling is usually done in private, typically in a [[bathroom]] at a sink so the liquid can be rinsed away.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pubchem&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Eucalyptol|title=Eucalyptol {{!}} C10H18O - PubChem|last=Pubchem|website=pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Listerine products.jpg|thumb]]
The most common use of mouthwash is commercial antiseptics, which are used at home as part of an [[oral hygiene]] routine. Examples of commercial mouthwashes companies include [[Cēpacol]], [[Colgate (toothpaste)|Colgate]], [[Corsodyl]], [[Dentyl pH]], [[Listerine]], [[:de:Odol|Odol]], [[Oral-B]], [[Sarakan]], [[Scope (mouthwash)|Scope]], [[Tantum verde]], and [[Biotene]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Mouthwashes combine ingredients to treat a variety of oral conditions. Variations are common, and mouthwash has no standard formulation so its use and recommendation involves concerns about [[patient safety]]. Some manufacturers of mouthwash state that antiseptic and anti-plaque mouth rinse kill the [[Dental plaque|bacterial plaque]] that causes [[Dental caries|cavities]], [[gingivitis]], and [[bad breath]]. It is, however, generally agreed that the use of mouthwash does not eliminate the need for both [[toothbrush|brushing]] and [[flossing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gunsolley&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17138709 |year=2006 |last1=Gunsolley |first1=JC |title=A meta-analysis of six-month studies of antiplaque and antigingivitis agents |volume=137 |issue=12 |pages=1649–57 |journal=Journal of the American Dental Association |doi=10.14219/jada.archive.2006.0110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tal&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=2366142 |year=1990 |last1=Tal |first1=H |last2=Rosenberg |first2=M |title=Estimation of dental plaque levels and gingival inflammation using a simple oral rinse technique |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=339–42 |journal=Journal of periodontology |doi=10.1902/jop.1990.61.6.339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6799764 |title=Listerine no replacement for flossing?|work=NBC News | date=7 January 2005 | accessdate=14 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Dental Association]] asserts that regular brushing and proper flossing are enough in most cases, in addition to regular dental check-ups, although they approve many mouthwashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Should I use Mouthwash: &quot;When to Use Mouthwash&quot;|url=http://brushflossandmouthwash.com/should-i-be-using-mouthwash/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For many patients, however, the mechanical methods could be tedious and time-consuming and additionally some local conditions may render them especially difficult. Chemotherapeutic agents, including mouthrinses, could have a key role as adjuncts to daily home care, preventing and controlling supragingival plaque, gingivitis and oral malodor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1806-83242007000500005 |title=The effect of mouthrinses against oral microorganisms|journal=Brazilian Oral Research|volume=21|pages=23–28|doi=10.1590/S1806-83242007000500005|year=2007|last1=Cortelli|first1=José Roberto|last2=Thénoux|first2=Raul Emilio de La Sotta|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minor and transient side effects of mouthwashes are very common, such as [[Dysgeusia|taste disturbance]], tooth staining, [[xerostomia|sensation of a dry mouth]], etc. Alcohol-containing mouthwashes may make dry mouth and halitosis worse since it dries out the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Doreen Oneschuk |author2=Neil Hagen |author3=Neil MacDonald |title=Palliative Medicine: A case-based manual|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191628733|page=126|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MJOE2MflzngC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=non+alcoholic+mouthwash+halitosis#v=onepage&amp;q=non%20alcoholic%20mouthwash%20halitosis&amp;f=false|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/life/health/2015/07/16/medications-diseases-among-factors-dry-mouth-cbt/30270419/|title=Medications, diseases among factors for dry mouth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soreness, ulceration and redness may sometimes occur (e.g. [[aphthous stomatitis]], [[allergic contact stomatitis]]) if the person is allergic or sensitive to mouthwash ingredients such as preservatives, coloring, flavors and fragrances. Such effects might be reduced or eliminated by diluting the mouthwash with water, using a different mouthwash (e.g. salt water), or foregoing mouthwash entirely.

Prescription mouthwashes are used prior to and after oral surgery procedures such as [[tooth extraction]] or to treat the pain associated with [[mucositis]] caused by [[radiation therapy]] or [[chemotherapy]]. They are also prescribed for [[aphthous ulcer]]s, other [[oral ulcer]]s, and other mouth pain.&lt;ref name=&quot;DetailDoc&quot;/&gt; Magic mouthwashes are prescription mouthwashes [[Compounding|compounded]] in a [[pharmacy]] from a list of ingredients specified by a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drotterholt.com/magicmouthwash.html |title=Magic Mouthwash |accessdate=2009-12-05 |last=Otterholt |first=Randall }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmacistsletter.com/(S(4xxt15452khjdpbrnmrxdbfi))/pl/Browse.aspx?s=PL&amp;dd=230703&amp;cat=4313&amp;pt=2 |title=Magic Mouthwash |accessdate=2009-12-05 |work=Pharmacist's Letter |publisher=Therapeutic Research Center }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a lack of evidence that prescription mouthwashes are more effective in decreasing the pain of oral [[lesion]]s, many patients and prescribers continue to use them. There has been only one [[Controlled experiment|controlled study]] to evaluate the [[efficacy]] of magic mouthwash; it shows no difference in efficacy among the most common formulation and commercial mouthwashes such as [[chlorhexidine]] or a [[Saline (medicine)|saline]]/[[baking soda]] solution. Current guidelines suggest that saline solution is just as effective as magic mouthwash in pain relief or shortening of healing time of oral mucositis from cancer therapies.&lt;ref name=&quot;DetailDoc&quot;/&gt;

The first known references to mouth rinsing is in [[Ayurveda]] and [[Chinese medicine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tooth brushing, oil pulling and tissue regeneration: A review of holistic approaches to oral health|last2=Purohit|first2=Bharathi|date=1 January 2011|website=Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine|pages=64–68|doi=10.4103/0975-9476.82525|last1=Singh|first1=Abhinav|pmc=3131773|pmid=21760690|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; about 2700 BC, for treatment of gingivitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Zyl|first=AW|last2=Heerden|first2=WFP Van|title=Mouthwash: A review for South African health care workers|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/20786204.2010.10873950|journal=South African Family Practice|volume=52|issue=2|pages=121–127|doi=10.1080/20786204.2010.10873950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] periods, mouth rinsing following mechanical cleansing became common among the upper classes, and [[Hippocrates]] recommended a mixture of salt, [[alum]], and vinegar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fischman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pages=7–14 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0757.1997.tb00099.x |title=The history of oral hygiene products: How far have we come in 6000 years? |year=1997 |last1=Fischman |first1=Stuart L. |journal=Periodontology 2000 |volume=15 |pmid=9643227 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish [[Talmud]], dating back about 1,800 years, suggests a cure for gum ailments containing &quot;dough water&quot; and olive oil.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shifman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12389360 |year=2002 |last1=Shifman |first1=A |last2=Orenbuch |first2=S |last3=Rosenberg |first3=M |title=Bad breath—a major disability according to the Talmud |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=843–5 |journal=The Israel Medical Association journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Europeans came to the Americas, Native North American and Mesoamerican cultures used mouthwashes, often made from plants such as ''[[Coptis trifolia]]''.&lt;ref name=Keoke2002 /&gt; Indeed, [[Aztec]] dentistry was more advanced than European dentistry of the age.&lt;ref name=Keoke2002 /&gt; Peoples of the Americas used salt water mouthwashes for sore throats, and other mouthwashes for problems such as [[teething]] and mouth ulcers.&lt;ref name=Keoke2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Keoke|first=Emory Dean|title=Encyclopedia of American Indian contributions to the world 15,000 years of inventions and innovations|year=2002|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4381-0990-9|page=180|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QIFTVWJH3doC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=salt+mouthwash#v=onepage&amp;q=salt%20mouthwash&amp;f=false|author2=Porterfield, Kay Marie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], the famous 17th century [[microscopist]], discovered living organisms (living, because they were mobile) in deposits on the teeth (what we now call [[dental plaque]]). He also found organisms in water from the canal next to his home in Delft. He experimented with samples by adding vinegar or brandy and found that this resulted in the immediate immobilization or killing of the organisms suspended in water. Next he tried rinsing the mouth of himself and somebody else with a mouthwash containing vinegar or brandy and found that living organisms remained in the dental plaque. He concluded—correctly—that the mouthwash either did not reach, or was not present long enough, to kill the plaque organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lax |first=Alistair |date=27 October 2005 |title=Toxin: The cunning of bacterial poisons |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IuvRClJOT5EC&amp;lpg=PT27&amp;dq=Leeuwenhoek%20dental%20plaque%20mouthwash&amp;pg=PT27#v=onepage&amp;q=Leeuwenhoek%20dental%20plaque%20mouthwash&amp;f=false |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-157850-2 |accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1892, German [[Richard Seifert (inventor)|Richard Seifert]] invented mouthwash product [[Odol]], which was produced by company founder [[Karl August Lingner]] (1861–1916) in [[Dresden]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lingner-archiv.jimdo.com/ Lingner-Archiv (German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

That remained the state of affairs until the late 1960s when Harald Loe (at the time a professor at the [[Aarhus University|Royal Dental College]] in [[Aarhus]], [[Denmark]]) demonstrated that a [[chlorhexidine]] compound could prevent the build-up of dental plaque. The reason for chlorhexidine effectiveness is that it strongly adheres to surfaces in the mouth and thus remains present in effective concentrations for many hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Loe&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=4575037 |year=1972 |last1=Budtz-Jörgensen |first1=E |last2=Löe |first2=H |title=Chlorhexidine as a denture disinfectant in the treatment of denture stomatitis |volume=80 |issue=6 |pages=457–64 |journal=Scandinavian journal of dental research |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0722.1972.tb00314.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then commercial interest in mouthwashes has been intense and several newer products claim effectiveness in reducing the build-up in dental plaque and the associated severity of gingivitis, in addition to fighting bad breath. Many of these solutions aim to control the Volatile Sulfur Compound (VSC)-creating anaerobic bacteria that live in the mouth and excrete substances that lead to bad breath and unpleasant mouth taste.&lt;ref name=Rosenberg1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kozlovsky/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosy&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8133414 |year=1994 |last1=Bosy |first1=A |last2=Kulkarni |first2=GV |last3=Rosenberg |first3=M |last4=McCulloch |first4=CA |title=Relationship of oral malodor to periodontitis: Evidence of independence in discrete subpopulations |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=37–46 |journal=Journal of periodontology |doi=10.1902/jop.1994.65.1.37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Loesche&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pages=256–79 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0757.2002.280111.x |title=Microbiology and treatment of halitosis |year=2002 |last1=Loesche |first1=Walter J. |last2=Kazor |first2=Christopher |journal=Periodontology 2000 |volume=28 |pmid=12013345 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yaegaki&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1499240 |year=1992 |last1=Yaegaki |first1=K |title=Effects of a two-phase oil-water mouthwash on halitosis |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=5-9 |journal=Clinical Preventive Dentistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the number of mouthwash variants in the United States of America has grown from 15 (1970) to 66 (1998) to 113 (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Aichner T., Coletti P. | year = 2013 | title = Customers' online shopping preferences in mass customization | url = | journal = Journal of Direct, Data and Digital Marketing Practice | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 20–35 | doi=10.1057/dddmp.2013.34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Research in the field of [[Microbiota (microbiology)|microbiota]]s shows that only a limited set of microbes cause tooth decay, with most of the bacteria in the human mouth being harmless. Focused attention on cavity-causing bacteria such as ''[[Streptococcus mutans]]'' has led research into new mouthwash treatments that prevent these bacteria from initially growing. While current mouthwash treatments must be used with a degree of frequency to prevent this bacteria from regrowing, future treatments could provide a viable long term solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2012/02/02/hacking-the-microbiome-for-fun-and-profit-can-killing-just-one-mouth-bacterium-stop-cavities/ |title=Hacking the Microbiome for Fun and Profit: Can Killing Just One Mouth Bacterium Stop Cavities? &amp;#124; 80beats &amp;#124; Discover Magazine |publisher=Blogs.discovermagazine.com |accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcohol===
[[File:Colgate Alcohol Free Mouthwash.jpg|thumb|An example of a commercial mouthwash brand which is alcohol-free]]
Alcohol is added to mouthwash not to destroy bacteria but to act as a carrier agent for essential active ingredients such as menthol, eucalyptol and thymol which help to penetrate plaque.&lt;ref name=&quot;cleef&quot;/&gt; Sometimes a significant amount of [[ethanol|alcohol]] (up to 27% vol) is added,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mildau&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Dirk W |last1=Lachenmeier |first2=Andrea |last2=Keck-Wilhelm |first3=Anne |last3=Sauermann |first4=Gerd |last4=Mildau |year=2008 |title=Safety Assessment of Alcohol-Containing Mouthwashes and Oral Rinses |journal=SOFW Journal |volume=134 |issue=10 |pages=70–8 |url=http://www.sofw.com/index/sofw_en/sofw_en_archive.html?cosearch=mouthwashes&amp;cosearch_sa=mouthwashes&amp;costart=&amp;date_from%5BY%5D=2004&amp;date_from%5Bm%5D=1&amp;date_until%5BY%5D=2008&amp;date_until%5Bm%5D=10&amp;do_search_sa=1&amp;naid=3193}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a carrier for the [[flavor]], to provide &quot;bite&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pader&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pader |first1=M. |title=Oral rinses |journal=[[Cosmetics &amp; Toiletries]] |date=October 1994 |volume=109 |issue=10 |pages=59–68 |issn=0361-4387}}{{Unreliable medical source|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the alcohol content, it is possible to fail a [[breathalyzer]] test after rinsing although breath alcohol levels return to normal after 10 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alcoholrehabadvice.com/dangers-of-drinking-mouthwash/|title=Dangers of Drinking Mouthwash {{!}} Alcohol Rehab Advice|website=alcoholrehabadvice.com|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, alcohol is a [[astringent|drying agent]], which encourages bacterial activity in the mouth, releasing more malodorous volatile sulfur compounds. Therefore, alcohol-containing mouthwash may temporarily worsen halitosis in those who already have it, or indeed be the sole cause of halitosis in other individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

It is hypothesized that alcohol mouthwashes acts as a [[carcinogen]] (cancer-inducing). Generally, there is no scientific consensus about this.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cole&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12956348 |year=2003 |last1=Cole |first1=P |last2=Rodu |first2=B |last3=Mathisen |first3=A |title=Alcohol-containing mouthwash and oropharyngeal cancer: A review of the epidemiology |volume=134 |issue=8 |pages=1079–87 |journal=Journal of the American Dental Association |doi=10.14219/jada.archive.2003.0322}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carretero&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=14990877 |year=2004 |last1=Carretero Peláez |first1=MA |last2=Esparza Gómez |first2=GC |last3=Figuero Ruiz |first3=E |last4=Cerero Lapiedra |first4=R |title=Alcohol-containing mouthwashes and oral cancer.

{{quote|There is now sufficient evidence to accept the proposition that developing oral cancer is increased or contributed to by the use of alcohol-containing mouthwashes. Whilst many of these products may have been shown to be effective in penetrating oral microbial biofilms in vitro and reducing oral bacterial load, it would be wise to restrict their use to short-term therapeutic situations if needed. Perhaps the use of mouthwashes that do not contain alcohol may be equally effective. Further, mouthrinses should be prescribed by dentists, like any other medication. There may well be a reason for the use of alcohol-containing mouthrinses, but only for a particular situation and for a limited and controlled period of time. As such, patients should be provided with written instructions for mouthwash use, and mouthwash use should be restricted to adults for short durations and specific, clearly defined reasons. It is the opinion of the authors that, in light of the evidence currently available of the association of alcohol-containing mouthwashes with the development of oral cancer, it would be inadvisable for oral healthcare professionals to recommend the long-term use of alcohol-containing mouthwashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1834-7819.2008.00070.x |title=The role of alcohol in oral carcinogenesis with particular reference to alcohol-containing mouthwashes |year=2008 |last1=McCullough |first1=MJ |last2=Farah |first2=CS |journal=Australian Dental Journal |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=302–5 |pmid=19133944}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pre-mixed mouthwashes of 1% sodium bicarbonate and 1.5% sodium chloride in [[aqueous solution]] are marketed,&lt;ref name=BNF&gt;{{cite web|title=Mouthwashes, gargles, and dentifrices|url=http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/bnf/current/PHP7409-mouthwashes-gargles-and-dentifrices.htm|work=[[British National Formulary]] March 2014|publisher=BMJ Group and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; although pharmacists will easily be able to produce such a formulation from the base ingredients when required. Sodium bicarbonate mouthwash is sometimes used to remove viscous saliva and to aid visualization of the oral tissues during examination of the mouth.&lt;ref name=Cawson2002&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Cawson RA, Odell EW, Porter S |title=Cawson's Essentials of Oral Pathology and Oral Medicine|year=2002|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0443071063|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}}

===Sodium chloride (salt)===
{{See also|Saline (medicine)}}
Salt water mouth wash is made by dissolving 0.5–1 teaspoon of table salt into a cup of water,&lt;ref name=Matthews2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BNF /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wray2003 /&gt; which is as hot as possible without causing discomfort in the mouth. Saline has a mechanical cleansing action and an antiseptic action as it is a [[hypertonic]] solution in relation to bacteria, which undergo [[lysis]]. The heat of the solution produces a therapeutic increase in blood flow ([[hyperemia]])&lt;ref name=BNF /&gt; to the surgical site, promoting healing.&lt;ref name=Matthews2003 /&gt; Hot salt water mouthwashes also encourage the draining of [[pus]] from [[dental abscess]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Clive Edwards |author2=Paul Stillman |title=Minor Illness or Major Disease?: The Clinical Pharmacist in the Community|year=2006|publisher=Pharmaceutical Press|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9780853696278|page=223|url=https://books.google.com/?id=o2nftDmulYIC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=salt+mouthwash#v=onepage&amp;q=salt%20mouthwash&amp;f=false|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, if heat is applied on the side of the face (e.g., hot water bottle) rather than inside the mouth, it may cause a dental abscess to drain extra-orally, which is later associated with an area of [[fibrosis]] on the face (see [[cutaneous sinus of dental origin]]).&lt;ref name=Wray2003 /&gt; Gargling with salt water is said to reduce the symptoms of a sore throat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Conner|first=Anahad|title=The Claim: Gargling with Salt Water Can Ease Cold Symptoms|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/health/28real.html|accessdate=12 January 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hot salt water mouth baths (or hot salt water mouth washes, sometimes abbreviated to &quot;HSWMW&quot;) are also routinely used after oral surgery, to keep food debris out of healing wounds and to prevent infection. Some oral surgeons consider salt water mouthwashes the mainstay of wound cleanliness after surgery.&lt;ref name=Wray2003&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Wray D, Stenhouse D, Lee D, Clark AJ |title=Textbook of General and Oral Surgery|year=2003|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh [etc.]|isbn=0443070830|pages=199, 210, 222}}&lt;/ref&gt; In dental extractions, hot salt water mouthbaths should start about 24 hours after a dental extraction.&lt;ref name=Wray2003 /&gt; The term ''mouth bath'' implies that the liquid is passively held in the mouth rather than vigorously swilled around, which could dislodge a blood clot. Once the blood clot has stabilized, the mouth wash can be used more vigorously.&lt;ref name=Wray2003 /&gt; These mouthwashes tend to be advised about 6 times per day, especially after meals to remove food from the socket.&lt;ref name=Wray2003 /&gt;

===Sodium lauryl sulfate (foaming agent) ===
[[Sodium lauryl sulfate]] (SLS) is user as a foaming agent in many oral hygiene products including many mouthwashes. Some may suggest that it is probably advisable to use mouthwash at least an hour after brushing with toothpaste when the toothpaste contains SLS, since the anionic compounds in the SLS [[toothpaste]] can deactivate cationic agents present in the mouthrinse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenberg3&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pages=72–9 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0402-72 |title=The Science of Bad Breath |year=2002 |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Mel |journal=Scientific American |volume=286 |issue=4 |pmid=11905111}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of the popular mouthwashes also contain SLS as an ingredient (e.g., Listerine Total Care).

=== [[Sucralfate]] ===

coating agent

=== Tetracycline (antibiotic)===
[[Tetracycline]] is an antibiotic which may sometimes be used as a mouthwash in adults (it causes red staining of teeth in children). It is sometimes use for herpetiforme ulceration (an uncommon type of aphthous stomatitis), but prolonged use may lead to oral candidiasis as the fungal population of the mouth overgrows in the absence of enough competing bacteria.&lt;ref name=Cawson2002 /&gt;{{rp|209}} [[Erythromycin]] is similar.&lt;ref name=&quot;DetailDoc&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Magic Mouthwash|journal=Pharmacist's Letter/Prescriber's Letter|date=2007-07-03|first=Wah-Chih|last=Tom|volume=23|issue=230703|pages=1–5|id= |url=http://mercypharmacy.wikispaces.com/file/view/MAGIC%20MOUTHWASH.pdf|format=|accessdate=2009-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tranexamic acid===
4.8% [[tranexamic acid]] solution is sometimes used as an [[antifibrinolytic]] mouthwash to prevent bleeding during and after oral surgery in persons with [[coagulopathy|coagulopathies]] (clotting disorders) or who are taking [[anticoagulant]]s (blood thinners such as [[warfarin]]).&lt;ref name=Glick2003&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Greenberg MS, Glick M |title=Burket's oral medicine diagnosis &amp; treatment|year=2003|publisher=BC Decker|location=Hamilton, Ont.|isbn=1550091867|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|473}}

===Triclosan===
Triclosan is a non-ionic chlorinate bisphenol antiseptic found in some mouthwashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drbenkim.com/articles/triclosan-products.htm|title=Products That Contain Triclosan|work=drbenkim.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When used in mouthwash (e.g. 0.03%), there is moderate substantivity, broad spectrum anti-bacterial action, some anti-fungal action and significant anti-plaque effect, especially when combined with [[copolymer]] or [[zinc citrate]].&lt;ref name=Scully2013 /&gt; Triclosan does not cause staining of the teeth.&lt;ref name=Scully2013 /&gt; The safety of triclosan has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyorkorthodontists.net/triclosan-dangers-side-effects-in-toothpastes-and-mouthwash/|title=New studies show dangers of Triclosan in Toothpastes and Mouthwash|work=New York Orthodontists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zinc ===
[[Astringents]] like zinc chloride provide a pleasant-tasting sensation and shrink tissues.&lt;ref name=GentleDENTALcare&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dentalgentlecare.com/mouthrinses.htm|title=FAMILY GENTLE DENTAL CARE - Mouth Rinses}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zinc#Topical use|Zinc]] when used in combination with other anti-septic agents can limit the build-up of [[Calculus (dental)#Prevention|tartar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/290616-zinc-treatment-for-bad-breath/|title=Zinc for Bad Breath (Halitosis)|last=McNamara|first=Melissa|newspaper=LIVESTRONG.COM|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
