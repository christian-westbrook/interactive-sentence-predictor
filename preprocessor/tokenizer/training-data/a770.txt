<text xml:space="preserve">“'''Hymn to Proserpine'''” is a [[poetry|poem]] by [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], published in ''[[Poems and Ballads]]'' in 1866.  The poem is addressed to the [[goddess]] [[Proserpina]], the Roman equivalent of [[Persephone]], but laments the rise of Christianity for displacing the pagan goddess and her pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Louis |first=Margot Kathleen |date= Spring 2005 |title=Gods and Mysteries: The Revival of Paganism and the Remaking of Mythography through the Nineteenth Century  |journal=Victorian Studies |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=329–361 |doi=10.1353/vic.2005.0100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] at the beginning of the poem is the phrase ''Vicisti, Galilaee'', [[Latin]] for &quot;You have conquered, O [[Galilean]]&quot;, the apocryphal [[Wikiquote:Last words|dying words]] of the Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]].  He had tried to reverse the official endorsement of [[Christianity]] by the [[Roman Empire]].  The poem is cast in the form of a [[lament]] by a person professing the [[paganism]] of [[classical antiquity]] and lamenting its passing, and expresses regret at the rise of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Eron |first=Sarah |year=2003 |title=Myth, Pattern, and Paradox in Swinburne's &quot;Hymn to Proserpine&quot; |publisher=Victorian Web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/swinburne/eron9.html |accessdate=Oct 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lines 35 and 36 express this best:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean; the world has grown grey from thy breath;''
''We have drunken of things [[Lethe]]an, and fed on the fullness of death.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The line &quot;Time and the Gods are at strife&quot; inspired the title of [[Lord Dunsany]]'s ''Time and the Gods''.

The poem is quoted by Sue Bridehead in [[Thomas Hardy]]'s 1895 novel, ''[[Jude the Obscure]]'' and also by Edward Ashburnham in [[Ford Madox Ford]]'s ''[[The Good Soldier]]''.
