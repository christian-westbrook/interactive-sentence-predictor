'''Agnosticism''' is the view that the [[existence of God]]  or the [[supernatural]] is unknown or&lt;!--probably?--&gt; [[Uncertainty|unknowable]].&lt;!--

&lt;!--
--&gt;According to the philosopher [[William L. Rowe]], &quot;agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RoweRoutledge&quot;/&gt; Agnosticism is a [[doctrine]] or set of [[wikt:tenet|tenet]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|agnosticism}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than a [[religion]].

English biologist [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] coined the word &quot;agnostic&quot; in 1869.
Earlier thinkers, however, had written works that promoted agnostic points of view, such as [[Sanjaya Belatthaputta]], a [[Ancient Indian philosophy|5th-century BCE Indian philosopher]] who expressed agnosticism about any [[afterlife]];&lt;!--

==Defining agnosticism==

{{quote|Agnosticism is of the essence of science, whether ancient or modern. It simply means that a man shall not say he knows or believes that which he has no scientific grounds for professing to know or believe.

Consequently, agnosticism puts aside not only the greater part of popular theology, but also the greater part of anti-theology. On the whole, the &quot;bosh&quot; of [[heterodoxy]] is more offensive to me than that of orthodoxy, because heterodoxy professes to be guided by reason and science, and orthodoxy does not.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Huxley, [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/UnColl/Rdetc/AgnAnn.html &quot;Agnosticism: A Symposium&quot;], ''The Agnostic Annual.'' 1884&lt;/ref&gt;|Thomas Henry Huxley}}

{{quote|That which Agnostics deny and repudiate, as immoral, is the contrary doctrine, that there are propositions which men ought to believe, without logically satisfactory evidence; and that reprobation ought to attach to the profession of disbelief in such inadequately supported propositions.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Huxley, [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE5/Agn-X.html &quot;Agnosticism and Christianity&quot;], ''Collected Essays V'', 1899&lt;/ref&gt;|Thomas Henry Huxley}}

{{quote|Agnosticism, in fact, is not a creed, but a method, the essence of which lies in the rigorous application of a single principle&amp;nbsp;... Positively the principle may be expressed: In matters of the intellect, follow your reason as far as it will take you, without regard to any other consideration. And negatively: In matters of the intellect do not pretend that conclusions are certain which are not demonstrated or demonstrable.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Huxley, [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE5/Agn.html &quot;Agnosticism&quot;], ''Collected Essays V'', 1889&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huxley|first=Thomas Henry|date=April 1889|title=Agnosticism|journal=[[Popular Science|The Popular Science Monthly]]|publisher=[[D.

Being a scientist, above all else, [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] presented agnosticism as a form of demarcation. A hypothesis with no supporting objective, testable evidence is not an objective, scientific claim. As such, there would be no way to test said hypotheses, leaving the results inconclusive. His agnosticism was not compatible with forming a belief as to the truth, or falsehood, of the claim at hand. [[Karl Popper]] would also describe himself as an agnostic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edward Zerin 1998&quot;&gt;Edward Zerin: Karl Popper On God: The Lost Interview. ''Skeptic'' '''6''':2 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; According to philosopher [[William L. Rowe]], in this strict sense, agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.&lt;ref name=RoweRoutledge/&gt;

Others have redefined this concept. [[George H. Smith]], while admitting that the narrow definition of atheist was the common usage definition of that word,&lt;ref&gt;George H. Smith, Atheism: The Case Against God, pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt; and admitting that the broad definition of agnostic was the common usage definition of that word,&lt;ref&gt;George H. Smith, Atheism: The Case Against God, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; promoted broadening the definition of atheist and narrowing the definition of agnostic. Smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as [[agnostic atheism]] (the view of those who do not ''believe'' in the existence of any deity, but do not claim to ''know'' if a deity does or does not exist) and [[agnostic theism]] (the view of those who do not claim to ''know'' of the existence of any deity, but still ''believe'' in such an existence).&lt;ref name=Smith1979&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FI7ZAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=atheism+the+case+against+god&amp;q=agnostic+theist#search_anchor |title=Atheism: The Case Against God |first=George H |last=Smith |authorlink=George H. Smith |pages=10–11 |quote=Properly considered, agnosticism is not a third alternative to theism and atheism because it is concerned with a different aspect of religious belief. Theism and atheism refer to the presence or absence of belief in a god; agnosticism refers to the impossibility of knowledge with regard to a god or supernatural being. The term ''agnostic'' does not, in itself, indicate whether or not one believes in a god. Agnosticism can be either theistic or atheistic. |year=1979 |isbn=978-0-87975-124-1 }}

===Etymology===
''Agnostic'' ({{ety|grc|ἀ- (a-)|without||[[wikt:γνῶσις|γνῶσις]] (gnōsis)|knowledge}}) was used by Thomas Henry Huxley in a speech at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1869 to describe his philosophy, which rejects all claims of spiritual or mystical knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Dixon| first = Thomas| title = Science and Religion: A Very Short Introduction| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2008| location = Oxford| page = 63| isbn = 978-0-19-929551-7}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EB-Agnosticism&quot;&gt;
{{cite encyclopedia|last=Antony|first=Flew|title=Agnosticism|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/9356/agnosticism|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early [[Christian]] church leaders used the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''[[gnosis]]'' (knowledge) to describe &quot;spiritual knowledge&quot;. Agnosticism is not to be confused with religious views opposing the ancient religious movement of [[Gnosticism]] in particular; Huxley used the term in a broader, more abstract sense.&lt;ref name=&quot;nknxjx&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=ag·nos·tic|website=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2011|url=http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=agnostic&amp;submit.x=20&amp;submit.y=28|accessdate= November 15, 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Huxley identified agnosticism not as a creed but rather as a method of [[Skepticism|skeptical]], evidence-based inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=97DaE6BzKTsC&amp;pg=PA41 |title=Aphorisms and Reflections |first=Henrietta A.| last=Huxley|publisher=Kessinger Publishing |year=2004|edition=reprint |pages=41–42|isbn=978-1-4191-0730-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, scientific literature dealing with neuroscience and psychology has used the word to mean &quot;not knowable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, Additions Series, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;
In technical and marketing literature, &quot;agnostic&quot; can also mean independence from some parameters—for example, &quot;platform agnostic&quot;&lt;ref name=SparkSheet&gt;{{cite web

===Qualifying agnosticism===
[[Scottish Enlightenment]] philosopher [[David Hume]] contended that meaningful statements about the universe are always qualified by some degree of doubt. He asserted that the fallibility of human beings means that they cannot obtain absolute certainty except in trivial cases where a statement is true by definition (e.g. [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] such as &quot;all bachelors are unmarried&quot; or &quot;all triangles have three corners&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David, &quot;An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding&quot; (1748)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types===
;Strong agnosticism (also called &quot;hard&quot;, &quot;closed&quot;, &quot;strict&quot;, or &quot;permanent agnosticism&quot;): The view that the question of the existence or nonexistence of a deity or deities, and the nature of ultimate reality is unknowable by reason of our natural inability to verify any experience with anything but another subjective experience. A strong agnostic would say, &quot;I cannot know whether a deity exists or not, and neither can you.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppy2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Oppy |first=Graham|title=Arguing about Gods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DlVtfUxPD14C&amp;pg=PA15|date=September 4, 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45889-4|pages=15–}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
;Weak agnosticism (also called &quot;soft&quot;, &quot;open&quot;, &quot;empirical&quot;, or &quot;temporal agnosticism&quot;): The view that the existence or nonexistence of any deities is currently unknown but is not necessarily unknowable; therefore, one will withhold judgment until evidence, if any, becomes available. A weak agnostic would say, &quot;I don't know whether any deities exist or not, but maybe one day, if there is evidence, we can find something out.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppy2006&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes2003&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Poidevin2010&quot; /&gt;
;Apathetic agnosticism: The view that no amount of debate can prove or disprove the existence of one or more deities, and if one or more deities exist, they do not appear to be concerned about the fate of humans. Therefore, their existence has little to no impact on personal human affairs and should be of little interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apatheticagnostic.com/ourchurch/faith.html|title=Commentary on the Articles of Faith|author=John Tyrrell|year=1996|quote=To believe in the existence of a god is an act of faith.

==History==

===Greek philosophy===
Agnostic thought, in the form of [[Philosophical skepticism|skepticism]], emerged as a formal philosophical position in [[ancient Greece]]. Its proponents included [[Protagoras]], [[Pyrrho]], [[Carneades]], [[Sextus Empiricus]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Sextus&quot;&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
and, to some degree, [[Socrates]], who was a strong advocate for a skeptical approach to [[epistemology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gareth Southwell |url=http://www.philosophyonline.co.uk/tok/scepticism8.htm |title=Scepticism&amp;nbsp;– History of Scepticism |publisher=Philosophyonline.co.uk |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826031745/http://www.philosophyonline.co.uk/tok/scepticism8.htm |archivedate=August 26, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pyrrho]] said that we should refrain from making judgment as we can never know the true reality. According to Pyrrho, having opinion was possible, but certainty and knowledge are impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Carneades]] was also a skeptic in relation to all knowledge claims. He proposed a probability theory, however.  According to him, certainty could never be attained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophos.com/philosophical_connections/profile_020.html |title=Philosophical Connections: Carneades |publisher=Philosophos.com |accessdate=February 9, 2014 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6NFdan6QI?url=http://philosophos.com/philosophical_connections/profile_020.html |archivedate=February 9, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Protagoras]] rejected the conventional accounts of the gods.

The skeptical empiricism of [[David Hume]], the [[antinomy|antinomies]] of [[Immanuel Kant]], and the existential philosophy of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] convinced many later philosophers to abandon these attempts, regarding it impossible to construct any unassailable proof for the existence or non-existence of God.&lt;ref name=&quot;RoweRoutledge-online&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.texttribe.com/routledge/A/Agnosticism.html |title=Agnosticism |first=William L. |last=Rowe |authorlink=William L.

{{quote|Let us call this unknown something: God. It is nothing more than a name we assign to it. The idea of demonstrating that this unknown something (God) exists, could scarcely suggest itself to Reason. For if God does not exist it would of course be impossible to prove it; and if he does exist it would be folly to attempt it. For at the very outset, in beginning my proof, I would have presupposed it, not as doubtful but as certain (a presupposition is never doubtful, for the very reason that it is a presupposition), since otherwise I would not begin, readily understanding that the whole would be impossible if he did not exist. But if when I speak of proving God's existence I mean that I propose to prove that the Unknown, which exists, is God, then I express myself unfortunately. For in that case I do not prove anything, least of all an existence, but merely develop the content of a conception.}}

{{quote|The first time that M. Hume found himself at the table of the Baron, he was seated beside him.

===Thomas Henry Huxley===
[[File:ThomasHenryHuxley.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Henry Huxley]]]]
Agnostic views are as old as [[philosophical skepticism]], but the terms agnostic and agnosticism were created by [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] to sum up his thoughts on contemporary developments of metaphysics about the &quot;unconditioned&quot; ([[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]]) and the &quot;unknowable&quot; ([[Herbert Spencer]]). Though Huxley began to use the term &quot;agnostic&quot; in 1869, his opinions had taken shape some time before that date. In a letter of September 23, 1860, to [[Charles Kingsley]], Huxley discussed his views extensively:&lt;ref name=&quot;Huxley1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Henry Huxley|title=The Major Prose of Thomas Henry Huxley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OAdUIXC32GkC&amp;pg=PA357|year=1997|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-1864-6|pages=357–}}

{{quote|I neither affirm nor deny the immortality of man. I see no reason for believing it, but, on the other hand, I have no means of disproving it. I have no ''a priori'' objections to the doctrine. No man who has to deal daily and hourly with nature can trouble himself about ''a priori'' difficulties. Give me such evidence as would justify me in believing in anything else, and I will believe that. Why should I not? It is not half so wonderful as the conservation of force or the indestructibility of matter&amp;nbsp;...

It is no use to talk to me of analogies and probabilities. I know what I mean when I say I believe in the law of the inverse squares, and I will not rest my life and my hopes upon weaker convictions&amp;nbsp;...

That my personality is the surest thing I know may be true. But the attempt to conceive what it is leads me into mere verbal subtleties. I have champed up all that chaff about the ego and the non-ego, noumena and phenomena, and all the rest of it, too often not to know that in attempting even to think of these questions, the human intellect flounders at once out of its depth.}}

And again, to the same correspondent, May 6, 1863:&lt;ref name=&quot;HuxleyHuxley2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Leonard Huxley|author2=Thomas Henry Huxley|title=Life and Letters of Thomas Henry Huxley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-azeZXAf6MMC&amp;pg=PA347|date=December 22, 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-04045-7|pages=347–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|I have never had the least sympathy with the ''a priori'' reasons against orthodoxy, and I have by nature and disposition the greatest possible antipathy to all the atheistic and infidel school. Nevertheless I know that I am, in spite of myself, exactly what the Christian would call, and, so far as I can see, is justified in calling, atheist and infidel. I cannot see one shadow or tittle of evidence that the great unknown underlying the phenomenon of the universe stands to us in the relation of a Father [who] loves us and cares for us as Christianity asserts. So with regard to the other great Christian dogmas, immortality of soul and future state of rewards and punishments, what possible objection can I—who am compelled perforce to believe in the immortality of what we call Matter and Force, and in a very unmistakable present state of rewards and punishments for our deeds—have to these doctrines? Give me a scintilla of evidence, and I am ready to jump at them.}}

Of the origin of the name agnostic to describe this attitude, Huxley gave the following account:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Collected Essays, Vol. V: Science and Christian Tradition| first=Thomas| last=Huxley| isbn= 1-85506-922-9| publisher=Macmillan and Co 1893| pages=237–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|When I reached intellectual maturity and began to ask myself whether I was an atheist, a theist, or a pantheist; a materialist or an idealist; Christian or a freethinker; I found that the more I learned and reflected, the less ready was the answer; until, at last, I came to the conclusion that I had neither art nor part with any of these denominations, except the last. The one thing in which most of these good people were agreed was the one thing in which I differed from them. They were quite sure they had attained a certain &quot;gnosis&quot;–had, more or less successfully, solved the problem of existence; while I was quite sure I had not, and had a pretty strong conviction that the problem was insoluble. And, with Hume and Kant on my side, I could not think myself presumptuous in holding fast by that opinion&amp;nbsp;...

So I took thought, and invented what I conceived to be the appropriate title of &quot;agnostic&quot;. It came into my head as suggestively antithetic to the &quot;gnostic&quot; of Church history, who professed to know so much about the very things of which I was ignorant.&amp;nbsp;... To my great satisfaction the term took.}}

In 1889, Huxley wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore, although it be, as I believe, demonstrable that we have no real knowledge of the authorship, or of the date of composition of the Gospels, as they have come down to us, and that nothing better than more or less probable guesses can be arrived at on that subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huxley|first=Thomas Henry|authorlink=Thomas Henry Huxley|title=Essays Upon Some Controverted Questions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_b7aAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA364|year=1892|publisher=Macmillan|page=364|chapter=Agnosticism And Christianity|quote=Agnosticism And Christianity: Therefore, although it be, as I believe, demonstrable that we have no real knowledge of the authorship, or of the date of composition of the Gospels, as they have come down to us, and that nothing better than more or less probable guesses can be arrived at on that subject.

In an 1896 lecture titled ''Why I Am An Agnostic'', Ingersoll related why he was an agnostic:&lt;ref name=&quot;infidels1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infidels.org/library/historical/robert_ingersoll/why_i_am_agnostic.html |title=Why I Am Agnostic|publisher=Infidels.org |accessdate=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Is there a supernatural power—an arbitrary mind—an enthroned God—a supreme will that sways the tides and currents of the world—to which all causes bow? I do not deny. I do not know—but I do not believe. I believe that the natural is supreme—that from the infinite chain no link can be lost or broken—that there is no supernatural power that can answer prayer—no power that worship can persuade or change—no power that cares for man.

I believe that with infinite arms Nature embraces the all—that there is no interference—no chance—that behind every event are the necessary and countless causes, and that beyond every event will be and must be the necessary and countless effects.

Is there a God? I do not know. Is man immortal? I do not know. One thing I do know, and that is, that neither hope, nor fear, belief, nor denial, can change the fact. It is as it is, and it will be as it must be.}}

In the conclusion of the speech he simply sums up the agnostic position as:&lt;ref name=&quot;infidels1&quot;/&gt;

In 1939, Russell gave a lecture on ''The existence and nature of God'', in which he characterized himself as an atheist. He said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Russell| first= Bertrand| title=Collected Papers, Vol 10|page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The existence and nature of God is a subject of which I can discuss only half. If one arrives at a negative conclusion concerning the first part of the question, the second part of the question does not arise; and my position, as you may have gathered, is a negative one on this matter.}}

However, later in the same lecture, discussing modern non-anthropomorphic concepts of God, Russell states:&lt;ref&gt;''Collected Papers, Vol. 10'', p.258&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|That sort of God is, I think, not one that can actually be disproved, as I think the omnipotent and benevolent creator can.}}

In Russell's 1947 pamphlet, ''Am I An Atheist or an Agnostic?'' (subtitled ''A Plea For Tolerance in the Face of New Dogmas''), he ruminates on the problem of what to call himself:&lt;ref name=&quot;Ewell2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Ken Ewell|title=Traveling with Philosophes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYgDxc90buUC&amp;pg=PA348|date=August 27, 2006|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-85361-8|pages=348–}}

No. An atheist, like a Christian, holds that we can know whether or not there is a God. The Christian holds that we can know there is a God; the atheist, that we can know there is not. The Agnostic suspends judgment, saying that there are not sufficient grounds either for affirmation or for denial.}}

A November–December 2006 poll published in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' gives rates for the United States and five European countries. The rates of agnosticism in the United States were at 14%, while the rates of agnosticism in the European countries surveyed were considerably higher: Italy (20%), Spain (30%), Great Britain (35%), Germany (25%), and France (32%).&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Criticism==
Agnosticism is criticized from a variety of standpoints. Some religious thinkers see agnosticism as limiting the mind's capacity to know reality to [[materialism]]. Some atheists criticize the use of the term agnosticism as functionally indistinguishable from atheism; this results in frequent criticisms of those who adopt the term as avoiding the atheist label.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB-Agnosticism&quot;/&gt;

===Theistic===
Theistic critics claim that agnosticism is impossible in practice, since a person can live only either as if God did not exist (''etsi deus non-daretur''), or as if God did exist (''etsi deus daretur'').&lt;ref name=SM&gt;

Religious scholars such as Laurence B. Brown criticize the misuse of the word agnosticism, claiming that it has become one of the most misapplied terms in metaphysics. Brown raises the question, &quot;You claim that nothing can be known with certainty ... how, then, can you be so sure?&quot;&lt;ref name=Islamrel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/641/ |title=Religion of Islam: Agnosticism |author=Laurence B.

====Christian====
According to [[Pope Benedict XVI]], strong agnosticism in particular contradicts itself in affirming the power of reason to know scientific [[truth]].&lt;ref name=YOJC/&gt;&lt;ref name=TT/&gt; He blames the exclusion of reasoning from religion and ethics for dangerous pathologies such as crimes against humanity and ecological disasters.&lt;ref name=YOJC&gt;{{cite book| title=The Yes of Jesus Christ: Spiritual Exercises in Faith, Hope, and Love| first=Joseph| last=Ratzinger|publisher=Cross Roads Publishing|year=2005}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TT&gt;{{cite book| title=Truth and Tolerance: Christian Belief And World Religions| first=Joseph| last=Ratzinger|publisher=[[Ignatius Press]]|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/papal-address-at-university-of-regensburg |title=Papal Address at University of Regensburg |publisher=zenit.org |date=September 12, 2006 |accessdate=June 29, 2014 |author=Benedict XVI |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6QhAgp8TR?url=http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/papal-address-at-university-of-regensburg |archivedate=June 29, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;Agnosticism&quot;, said Ratzinger, &quot;is always the fruit of a refusal of that knowledge which is in fact offered to man&amp;nbsp;... The knowledge of God has always existed&quot;.&lt;ref name=TT/&gt; He asserted that agnosticism is a choice of comfort, pride, dominion, and utility over truth, and is opposed by the following attitudes: the keenest self-criticism, humble listening to the whole of existence, the persistent patience and self-correction of the [[scientific method]], a readiness to be purified by the truth.&lt;ref name=YOJC/&gt;

The [[Catholic Church]] sees merit in examining what it calls &quot;partial agnosticism&quot;, specifically those systems that &quot;do not aim at constructing a complete philosophy of the unknowable, but at excluding special kinds of truth, notably religious, from the domain of knowledge&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CEnc1&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Church is historically opposed to a full denial of the capacity of human reason to know God. The [[Council of the Vatican]] declares, &quot;God, the beginning and end of all, can, by the natural light of human reason, be known with certainty from the works of creation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CEnc1&quot;/&gt;

[[Blaise Pascal]] argued that even if there were truly no evidence for God, agnostics should consider what is now known as [[Pascal's Wager]]: the [[Infinity|infinite]] expected value of acknowledging God is always greater than the finite expected value of not acknowledging his existence, and thus it is a safer &quot;bet&quot; to choose God.&lt;ref name=PKPW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peterkreeft.com/topics/pascals-wager.htm| title=Argument from Pascal's Wager| year=2007 | accessdate=May 25, 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605044148/http://peterkreeft.com/topics/pascals-wager.htm| archivedate=June 5, 2008 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atheistic===
According to [[Richard Dawkins]], a distinction between agnosticism and atheism is unwieldy and depends on how close to zero a person is willing to rate the probability of existence for any given god-like entity. About himself, Dawkins continues, &quot;I am agnostic only to the extent that I am agnostic about fairies at the bottom of the garden.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006), Bantam Press, p.&amp;nbsp;51&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins also identifies two categories of agnostics; &quot;Temporary Agnostics in Practice&quot; (TAPs), and &quot;Permanent Agnostics in Principle&quot; (PAPs). He states that &quot;agnosticism about the existence of God belongs firmly in the temporary or TAP category. Either he exists or he doesn't. It is a scientific question; one day we may know the answer, and meanwhile we can say something pretty strong about the probability.&quot;, and considers PAP a &quot;deeply inescapable kind of fence-sitting&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006), Bantam Press, pp&amp;nbsp;47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related concepts==
[[Ignosticism]] is the view that a coherent definition of a deity must be put forward before the question of the existence of a deity can be meaningfully discussed. If the chosen definition is not coherent, the ignostic holds the [[theological noncognitivism|noncognitivist]] view that the existence of a deity is meaningless or empirically untestable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strongatheism.net/library/atheology/argument_from_noncognitivism/ |title=The Argument From Non-Cognitivism |accessdate=October 1, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6N59bmP1Y?url=http://www.strongatheism.net/library/atheology/argument_from_noncognitivism/ |archivedate=February 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Ayer|A.J. Ayer]], [[Theodore Drange]], and other philosophers see both atheism and agnosticism as incompatible with ignosticism on the grounds that atheism and agnosticism accept &quot;a deity exists&quot; as a meaningful proposition that can be argued for or against.&lt;ref&gt;Ayer, ''Language'', 115: &quot;There can be no way of proving that the existence of a God&amp;nbsp;... is even probable.&amp;nbsp;... For if the existence of such a god were probable, then the proposition that he existed would be an empirical hypothesis. And in that case it would be possible to deduce from it, and other empirical hypotheses, certain experimental propositions which were not deducible from those other hypotheses alone. But in fact this is not possible.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Drange&quot;&gt;Drange, ''Atheism''&lt;/ref&gt;
