[[File:Weltchronik Fulda Aa88 286r detail.jpg|thumb|right|The death of Absalom, hanging from a tree by his hair (14th-century German miniature).]]

'''Absalom''' or '''Avshalom''' ({{Hebrew Name|אַבְשָלוֹם|Avshalom|ʼAḇšālôm|&quot;Father of peace&quot;}}) according to the [[Hebrew Bible]] was the third son of [[David (biblical king)|David]], [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|King of Israel]] with [[Maachah]], daughter of [[Talmai]], King of [[Geshur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|3:2|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|3:3|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|14:25|NIV}} describes him as the most handsome man in the kingdom. Absalom eventually rebelled against his father and was killed during the [[Battle of the Wood of Ephraim|Battle of Ephraim Wood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|18:1–17|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Absalom, David's third son, by Maacah, was born in [[Hebron]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|3:3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moved at an early age along with the transfer of the capital to [[Jerusalem]], where he spent most of his life. He was a great favorite of his father and of the people. His charming manners, personal beauty, and insinuating ways, together with his love of pomp and royal pretensions, captivated the hearts of the people from the beginning. He lived in great style, drove in a magnificent chariot and had fifty men run before him.

Little is known of Absalom's family life, but the biblical narrative states that he had three sons and one daughter, whose name was also Tamar.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|14:27}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the language of {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|18:18}}, &quot;I have no son to keep my name in remembrance&quot;, it is inferred that his sons died at an early age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/18.htm Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges] on 2 Samuel 18, accessed 6 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|11:20|NKJV}} says that Absalom has another daughter or grand-daughter named [[Maacah]], who later became the favorite wife of [[Rehoboam]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=2 Chronicles 11:20 cev : Then Rehoboam married Maacah the daughter of Absalom; 2 Chronicles 11:21 cev : Rehoboam loved his wife Maacah the most |url=https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=rehoboam+maacah&amp;qs_version=CEV}}. A [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Chronicles%2011:19-21&amp;version=NKJV#fen-NKJV-11435a footnote in the New King James Version] reads &quot;Literally ''daughter'', but in the broader sense of granddaughter&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder of Amnon==
[[File:Convito di Ansalonne.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[The Banquet of Absalom]] attributed to [[Niccolò de Simone]] around 1650]]
Absalom's sister [[Tamar (2 Samuel)|Tamar]] was raped by [[Amnon]], who was their half-brother. Amnon was also David's eldest son. After the rape, Absalom waited two years, and then avenged Tamar by sending his servants to murder a drunken Amnon at a feast, to which Absalom had invited all the king's sons ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|13|NIV}}).

After this murder Absalom fled to [[Talmai]], who was the king of [[Geshur]] and Absalom's maternal grandfather &lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|13:37|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also {{bibleverse||Joshua|12:5|NIV}} or {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|13:2|NIV}}). It was not until three years later that Absalom was fully reinstated in his father's favour and finally returned to Jerusalem&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|13–14|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Joab]]).

==The revolt at Hebron==
[[File:InsideAbsalom'sPillar.jpg|thumb|Two views of the burial chamber inside the so-called [[Tomb of Absalom]] in the [[Valley of Jehoshaphat]], [[Jerusalem]], which has no connection to biblical Absalom.]]

While at Jerusalem, Absalom built support for himself by speaking to those who came to King David for justice, saying, “See, your claims are good and right; but there is no one deputed by the king to hear you&quot;, perhaps reflecting flaws in the judicial system of the United Monarchy. &quot;If only I were the judge of the land! Then all who had a suit or cause might come to me, and I would give them justice.&quot; He made gestures of humility by kissing those who bowed before him instead of accepting supplication. He &quot;stole the hearts of the people of Israel&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|15|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After four years he declared himself king, raised a revolt at [[Hebron]], the former capital, and slept with his father's concubines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirk-Duggan2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Kirk-Duggan |first=Cheryl A.|year=2004 |title=Pregnant Passion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M_gW1I90G4MC&amp;pg=PA59 |accessdate=10 March 2013 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9789004127319 |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Israel and Judah flocked to him, and David, attended only by the [[Cherethites]] and [[Pelethites]] and his former bodyguard, which had followed him from Gath, found it expedient to flee. The priests Zadok and Abiathar remained in Jerusalem, and their sons Jonathan and Ahimaaz served as David's spies. Absalom reached the capital and consulted with the renowned [[Ahithophel]] (sometimes spelled Achitophel).

David took refuge from Absalom's forces beyond the [[Jordan River]]. However, he took the precaution of instructing a servant, [[Hushai]], to infiltrate Absalom's court and subvert it. Hushai convinced Absalom to ignore Ahithophel's advice to attack his father while he was on the run, and instead to prepare his forces for a major attack. This gave David critical time to prepare his own troops for the coming battle.

==The Battle of Ephraim's Wood==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Yerushalayim Tomb of Absalom 1860s.jpg|thumb|right|Photo of [[Tomb of Absalom|Absalom's Tomb]] in Kidron Valley (1860s)]] --&gt;

A fateful [[Battle of the Wood of Ephraim|battle]] was fought in the [[Wood of Ephraim]] (the name suggests a locality west of the Jordan) and Absalom's army was completely routed.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|16:18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absalom's head was caught in the boughs of an oak tree as the mule he was riding ran beneath it. He was discovered there still alive by one of David's men, who reported this to [[Joab]], the king's commander. Joab, accustomed to avenging himself, took this opportunity to even the score with Absalom.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|14:30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absalom once had Joab's field set on fire &lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|17:25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then made Amasa Captain of the Host instead of Joab. Killing Absalom was against David's explicit command, &quot;Beware that none touch the young man Absalom&quot;. Joab killed Absalom with three darts through the heart.

When David heard that Absalom was killed, although not how he was killed, he greatly sorrowed.
:''O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!'' &lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|18:33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
David withdrew to the city ([[Mahanaim]]) &lt;ref&gt;See {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|19:32}}&lt;/ref&gt; in mourning, until Joab roused him from &quot;the extravagance of his grief&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/19.htm Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges] on 2 Samuel 19, accessed 12 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and called on him to fulfil his duty to his people.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|19:1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorial to Absalom==
Absalom had erected a monument near [[Jerusalem]] to perpetuate his name:&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|18:18|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a monument, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's monument.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is now the monument known as the Pillar or [[Tomb of Absalom]], which is dated to the first century AD.
