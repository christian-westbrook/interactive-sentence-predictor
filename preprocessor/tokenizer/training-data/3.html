This file is interesting.  I am interested in how you handle numbers and special characters.

Did you know that there are over 7,500 students enrolled at the moment?  There are also more than 330,123,456 people in the US. <br>

I like fake statistics.  Did you know that 123,456.78 people like ice cream?

This is a piece of <strong>c</strong>ake!


100 - 15 = 85 or does it equal 9381.3213?  Is 85 &gt; 9281 * 2?  I don't know.
