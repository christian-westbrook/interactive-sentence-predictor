'''Albertus Magnus''',&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-la|Albertus Teutonicus, Albertus Coloniensis}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dominican Order|O.P.]] (c. 1200 – November 15, 1280), also known as '''Saint Albert the Great''' and '''Albert of Cologne''', was a [[Germans|German]] [[Catholic]] [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[friar]] and [[Catholic bishop|bishop]]. Later canonised as a [[Catholic saint]], he was known during his lifetime as ''Doctor universalis'' and ''Doctor expertus'' and, late in his life, the [[sobriquet]] ''[[List of people known as &quot;the Great&quot;|Magnus]]'' was appended to his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |editor-last=Weisheipl |editor-first=James A. |last=Weisheipl |first=James A. |title=Albertus Magnus and the Sciences: Commemorative Essays |place=Toronto |publisher=Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies |series=Studies and texts |volume=49 |year=1980 |chapter=The Life and Works of St. Albert the Great |page=46 |isbn=0-88844-049-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as James A. Weisheipl and Joachim R. Söder have referred to him as the greatest German philosopher and theologian of the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Joachim R. Söder, &quot;Albert der Grosse – ein staunen- erregendes Wunder,&quot; Wort und Antwort 41 (2000): 145; J.A. Weisheipl, &quot;Albertus Magnus,&quot; Joseph Strayer ed., Dictionary of the Middle Ages 1 (New York: Scribner, 1982) 129.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic Church]] distinguishes him as one of the 36 [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors of the Church]].

==Biography==
It seems likely that Albert was born sometime before 1200, given well-attested evidence that he was aged over 80 on his death in 1280. More than one source says that Albert was 87 on his death, which has led 1193 to be commonly given as the date of Albert's birth.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Albert was probably born in [[Lauingen]] (now in [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]]), since he called himself 'Albert of Lauingen', but this might simply be a family name. Most probably his family was of ''ministerial'' class; his familiar connection with (being son of the count) Bollstädt noble family was a 15th-century misinterpretation that is now completely disproved.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Tugwell, Simon. ''Albert and Thomas,'' New York Paulist Press, 1988, p. 3, 96–7&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2016}}

Albert was probably educated principally at the [[University of Padua]], where he received instruction in [[Aristotle]]'s writings. A late account by Rudolph de Novamagia refers to Albertus' encounter with the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], who convinced him to enter [[Holy Orders]]. In 1223 (or 1229){{sfn|Tugwell|1988|pp=4–5}} he became a member of the [[Dominican Order]], and studied [[theology]] at [[Bologna]] and elsewhere. Selected to fill the position of lecturer at Cologne, Germany, where the Dominicans had a house, he taught for several years there, as well as in [[Regensburg]], [[Freiburg]], [[Strasbourg]], and [[Hildesheim]]. During his first tenure as lecturer at Cologne, Albert wrote his ''Summa de bono'' after discussion with [[Philip the Chancellor]] concerning the transcendental properties of being.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kovach, Francs 1980, p.X&quot;&gt;Kovach, Francs, and Rober Shahan. Albert the Great: Commemorative Essays . Norman, Oklahoma: University of Oklahoma Press, 1980, p.X&lt;/ref&gt; In 1245, Albert became master of theology under Gueric of Saint-Quentin, the first German Dominican to achieve this distinction. Following this turn of events, Albert was able to teach theology at the [[University of Paris]] as a full-time professor, holding the seat of the Chair of Theology at the College of St. James.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kovach, Francs 1980, p.X&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hampden, ''The Life'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time [[Thomas Aquinas]] began to study under Albertus.&lt;ref name=Kennedy&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01264a.htm Kennedy, Daniel. &quot;St. Albertus Magnus.&quot; The Catholic Encyclopedia.

[[File:Vincenzo onofri, sant'alberto magno, 1493.JPG|thumb|left|Bust of Albertus Magnus by [[Vincenzo Onofri]], c. 1493]]

Albert was the first to comment on virtually all of the writings of [[Aristotle]], thus making them accessible to wider academic debate. The study of Aristotle brought him to study and comment on the teachings of Muslim academics, notably [[Avicenna]] and [[Averroes]], and this would bring him into the heart of academic debate.

In 1254 Albert was made [[provincial superior|provincial]] of the Dominican Order,&lt;ref name=Kennedy /&gt; and fulfilled the duties of the office with great care and efficiency. During his tenure he publicly defended the Dominicans against attacks by the secular and regular faculty of the University of Paris, commented on [[John the Evangelist]], and answered what he perceived as errors of the [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]] Averroes.

In 1259 Albert took part in the General Chapter of the Dominicans at [[Valenciennes]] together with Thomas Aquinas, masters Bonushomo Britto,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Histoire littéraire de la France: XIIIe siècle |volume=19 |page=103 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LIYNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=bonushomo#v=onepage&amp;q=bonushomo&amp;f=false |accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florentius,&lt;ref&gt;Probably Florentius de Hidinio, a.k.a.

[[File:2004 Köln Sarkophag Albertus Magnus.JPG|thumb|Roman [[sarcophagus]] containing the relics of Albertus Magnus in the crypt of [[St. Andrew's Church, Cologne]], Germany]]

In 1260 [[Pope Alexander IV]] made him [[bishop of Regensburg]], an office from which he resigned after three years. During the exercise of his duties he enhanced his reputation for humility by refusing to ride a horse, in accord with the dictates of the Order, instead traversing his huge diocese on foot. This earned him the affectionate sobriquet &quot;boots the bishop&quot; from his parishioners. In 1263 [[Pope Urban IV]] relieved him of the duties of bishop and asked him to preach the [[eighth Crusade]] in German-speaking countries.&lt;ref name=Markus&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/albert-great/ Führer, Markus, &quot;Albert the Great&quot;, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.),]&lt;/ref&gt;  After this, he was especially known for acting as a mediator between conflicting parties. In Cologne he is not only known for being the founder of Germany's oldest university there, but also for &quot;the big verdict&quot; (der Große Schied) of 1258, which brought an end to the conflict between the citizens of Cologne and the archbishop. Among the last of his labors was the defense of the orthodoxy of his former pupil, Thomas Aquinas, whose death in 1274 grieved Albert (the story that he travelled to Paris in person to defend the teachings of Aquinas can not be confirmed).

After suffering a collapse of health in 1278, he died on November 15, 1280, in the Dominican convent in Cologne, [[Germany]]. Since November 15, 1954, his relics are in a Roman sarcophagus in the [[crypt]] of the Dominican St. [[Andreas]] Church in Cologne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gemeinden.erzbistum-koeln.de/st_andreas_koeln/albertusMagnus/ |title=Zeittafel |publisher=Gemeinden.erzbistum-koeln.de |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although his body was discovered to be incorrupt at the first exhumation three years after his death, at the exhumation in 1483 only a skeleton remained.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cruz 1977&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Incorruptibles: A Study of the Incorruption of the Bodies of Various Catholic Saints and Beati |last=Carroll Cruz |first=Joan |publisher=TAN Books |location=[[Charlotte, NC]] |year=1977 |isbn=0-89555-066-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert was [[beatified]] in 1622. He was [[canonized]] and proclaimed a Doctor of the Church on December 16, 1931, by [[Pope Pius XI]]&lt;ref name=Markus /&gt; and the patron saint of natural scientists in 1941. St. Albert's [[feast day]] is November 15.

==Writings==
[[File:Albertus Magnus-Denkmal.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Albertus Magnus monument at the [[University of Cologne]]]]

Albert's writings collected in 1899 went to thirty-eight volumes. These displayed his prolific habits and encyclopedic knowledge of topics such as [[logic]], [[theology]], [[botany]], [[geography]], [[astronomy]], [[astrology]], [[mineralogy]], [[alchemy]], [[zoology]], [[physiology]], [[phrenology]], [[justice]], [[law]], [[friendship]], and [[love]]. He digested, interpreted, and systematized the whole of Aristotle's works, gleaned from the Latin translations and notes of the Arabian commentators, in accordance with Church doctrine. Most modern knowledge of Aristotle was preserved and presented by Albert.&lt;ref name=Kennedy /&gt;

His principal theological works are a commentary in three volumes on the Books of the Sentences of [[Peter Lombard]] (''Magister Sententiarum''), and the ''Summa Theologiae'' in two volumes. The latter is in substance a more didactic repetition of the former.

Albert's activity, however, was more philosophical than theological (see [[Scholasticism]]). The philosophical works, occupying the first six and the last of the 21 volumes, are generally divided according to the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] scheme of the sciences, and consist of interpretations and condensations of Aristotle's relative works, with supplementary discussions upon contemporary topics, and occasional divergences from the opinions of the master. Albert believed that Aristotle's approach to natural philosophy did not pose any obstacle to the development of a Christian philosophical view of the natural order.&lt;ref name=Markus /&gt;

[[File:Firenze, alberto magno, de animalibus, 1450-1500 ca. cod fiesolano 67, 01.JPG|thumb|250px|''De animalibus'' (1450–1500 ca., cod. fiesolano 67, [[Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana]])]]

Albert's knowledge of physical science was considerable and for the age remarkably accurate. His industry in every department was great, and though we find in his system many gaps which are characteristic of scholastic philosophy, his protracted study of Aristotle gave him a great power of systematic thought and exposition. An exception to this general tendency is his Latin treatise &quot;De falconibus&quot; (later inserted in the larger work, ''De Animalibus'', as book 23, chapter 40), in which he displays impressive actual knowledge of a) the differences between the [[birds of prey]] and the other kinds of birds; b) the different kinds of [[falcon]]s; c) the way of preparing them for the [[Hunting|hunt]]; and d) the cures for sick and wounded falcons.&lt;ref&gt;An Smets, &quot;Le réception en langue vulgaire du &quot;De falconibus&quot; d'Albert le Grand,&quot; in: ''Medieval Forms of Argument: Disputation and Debate'', ed. Georgiana Donavin, Carol Poster, and Richard Utz (Eugene, OR: Wipf &amp; Stock, 2002), pp. 189–99.&lt;/ref&gt; His scholarly legacy justifies his contemporaries' bestowing upon him the honourable surname ''Doctor Universalis.''

In ''De Mineralibus'' Albert claims, &quot;The aim of natural philosophy (science) is not simply to accept the statements of others, but to investigate the causes that are at work in nature.&quot; Aristotelianism greatly influences Albert's view on nature and philosophy.&lt;ref name=Kennedy /&gt; Another example of his reason to formally search for the causes is in his treatises on plants, he begins with the principle, experiment is the only safe guide in such investigations. His studies of Aristotle and theology show their colors in nearly all of his works and volumes.

Albert placed emphasis on experiment as well as investigation, but he respected authority and tradition so much that many of his investigations or experiments were unpublished. Albert would often keep silent about many issues such as astronomy, physics and such because he felt that his theories were too advanced for the time in which he was living.&lt;ref name=Kennedy /&gt;

==Alchemy==
[[File:Liebig Company Trading Card Ad 01.12.003 front.tif|thumb|left|250px| Albertus Magnus, Chimistes Celebres, [[Liebig's Extract of Meat Company]] Trading Card, 1929]]

In the centuries since his death, many stories arose about Albert as an [[Alchemy|alchemist]] and magician. &quot;Much of the modern confusion results from the fact that later works, particularly the alchemical work known as the ''Secreta Alberti'' or the ''Experimenta Alberti'', were falsely attributed to Albertus by their authors to increase the prestige of the text through association.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Katz, David A., &quot;An Illustrated History of Alchemy and Early Chemistry&quot;, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; On the subject of alchemy and chemistry, many treatises relating to alchemy have been attributed to him, though in his authentic writings he had little to say on the subject, and then mostly through commentary on Aristotle. For example, in his commentary, ''De mineralibus'', he refers to the power of stones, but does not elaborate on what these powers might be.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Wieland, &quot;Albert der Grosse.  Der Entwurf einer eigenständigen Philosophie,&quot; Philosophen des Mittelalters (Darmstadt: Primus, 2000) 124-39.&lt;/ref&gt; A wide range of Pseudo-Albertine works dealing with alchemy exist, though, showing the belief developed in the generations following Albert's death that he had mastered alchemy, one of the fundamental sciences of the Middle Ages. These include ''Metals and Materials''; the ''Secrets of Chemistry''; the ''Origin of Metals''; the ''Origins of Compounds'', and a ''Concordance ''which is a collection of ''Observations on the [[philosopher's stone]]''; and other alchemy-chemistry topics, collected under the name of ''Theatrum Chemicum''.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, John, ''The Thirteenth, Greatest of Centuries.'' 1907:46 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=_rofAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA46&amp;dq=albertus+magnus+gold+minerals#PRA2-PA46,M1 available online]).&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with the discovery of the element [[arsenic]]&lt;ref name=&quot;BuildingBlocks451-3&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Emsley |first=John |title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements |year=2001 |isbn=0-19-850341-5 |pages=43,513,529 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; and experimented with photosensitive chemicals, including [[silver nitrate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davidson |first=Michael W. |author2=National High Magnetic Field Laboratory at The Florida State University |title=Molecular Expressions: Science, Optics and You&amp;nbsp;— Timeline&amp;nbsp;— Albertus Magnus |publisher=The Florida State University |date=2003-08-01 |url=http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/optics/timeline/people/magnus.html |accessdate=2009-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330045629/http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/optics/timeline/people/magnus.html |archivedate=2010-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Szabadváry |first=Ferenc |title=History of analytical chemistry |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1992 |location= |page=17 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=53APqy0KDaQC |isbn=2-88124-569-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did believe that stones had occult properties, as he related in his work ''De mineralibus''. However, there is scant evidence that he personally performed alchemical experiments.

According to legend, Albert is said to have discovered the philosopher's stone and passed it on to his pupil Thomas Aquinas, shortly before his death. Albert does not confirm he discovered the stone in his writings, but he did record that he witnessed the creation of gold by &quot;transmutation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Julian Franklyn and Frederick E. Budd. ''A Survey of the Occult.'' Electric Book Company. 2001. p. 28-30. {{ISBN|1-84327-087-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that Thomas Aquinas died six years before Albert's death, this legend as stated is unlikely.

==Astrology==

Albert was deeply interested in astrology, as has been articulated by scholars such as Paola Zambelli.&lt;ref&gt;Paola Zambelli, &quot;The Speculum Astronomiae and its Enigma&quot; Dordrecht.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the Middle Ages&amp;nbsp;–and well into the early modern period&amp;nbsp;–astrology was widely accepted by scientists and intellectuals who held the view that life on earth is effectively a microcosm within the macrocosm (the latter being the cosmos itself). It was believed that correspondence therefore exists between the two and thus the celestial bodies follow patterns and cycles analogous to those on earth. With this worldview, it seemed reasonable to assert that astrology could be used to predict the probable future of a human being. Albert made this a central component of his philosophical system, arguing that an understanding of the celestial influences affecting us could help us to live our lives more in accord with Christian precepts.&lt;ref&gt;Scott E. Hendrix, How Albert the Great's Speculum Astronomiae Was Interpreted and Used by Four Centuries of Readers (Lewiston: 2010), 44-46.&lt;/ref&gt; The most comprehensive statement of his astrological beliefs is to be found in a work he authored around 1260, now known as the ''[[Speculum astronomiae]]''. However, details of these beliefs can be found in almost everything he wrote, from his early ''De natura boni'' to his last work, the ''Summa theologiae''.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrix, 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Matter and form==
Albert believed that all natural things were compositions of matter and form, he referred to it as ''quod est'' and ''quo est''. Albert also believed that God alone is the absolute ruling entity. Albert's version of [[hylomorphism]] is very similar to the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] doctrine.

==Music==
Albert is known for his commentary on the musical practice of his times. Most of his written musical observations are found in his commentary on Aristotle's ''Poetics''. He rejected the idea of &quot;[[Musica universalis|music of the spheres]]&quot; as ridiculous: movement of astronomical bodies, he supposed, is incapable of generating sound. He wrote extensively on proportions in music, and on the three different subjective levels on which [[plainchant]] could work on the human soul: purging of the impure; illumination leading to contemplation; and nourishing perfection through contemplation. Of particular interest to 20th-century music theorists is the attention he paid to silence as an integral part of music.

==Metaphysics of morals==
Both of his early treatises, ''De natura boni'' and ''De bono'', start with a metaphysical investigation into the concepts of the good in general and the physical good. Albert refers to the physical good as ''bonum naturae''. Albert does this before directly dealing with the moral concepts of metaphysics. In Albert's later works, he says in order to understand human or moral goodness, the individual must first recognize what it means to be good and do good deeds. This procedure reflects Albert's preoccupations with neo-Platonic theories of good as well as the doctrines of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]].&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Stanley. Reclaiming Moral Agency: The Moral Philosophy of Albert the Great. Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University Of America Press, 2008 p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; Albert's view was highly valued by the Catholic Church and his peers.

==Natural law==
Albert devoted the last tractatus of ''De Bono'' to a theory of justice and [[natural law]]. Albert places God as the pinnacle of justice and natural law. God legislates and divine authority is supreme. Up until his time, it was the only work specifically devoted to natural law written by a theologian or philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Stanley. Reclaiming Moral Agency: The Moral Philosophy of Albert the Great. Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University Of America Press, 2008 p.207&lt;/ref&gt;

==Friendship==

Albert mentions friendship in his work, ''De bono'', as well as presenting his ideals and morals of friendship in the very beginning of ''Tractatus II''. Later in his life he published ''Super Ethica''.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Stanley. Reclaiming Moral Agency: The Moral Philosophy of Albert the Great. Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University Of America Press, 2008 p.242&lt;/ref&gt; With his development of friendship throughout his work it is evident that friendship ideals and morals took relevance as his life went on. Albert comments on Aristotle's view of friendship with a quote from [[Cicero]], who writes, &quot;friendship is nothing other than the harmony between things divine and human, with goodwill and love&quot;. Albert agrees with this commentary but he also adds in harmony or agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Stanley. Reclaiming Moral Agency: The Moral Philosophy of Albert the Great. Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University Of America Press, 2008 p.243&lt;/ref&gt; Albert calls this harmony, ''consensio'', itself a certain kind of movement within the human spirit. Albert fully agrees with Aristotle in the sense that friendship is a virtue. Albert relates the inherent metaphysical contentedness between friendship and moral goodness. Albert describes several levels of goodness; the useful (''utile''), the pleasurable (''delectabile'') and the authentic or unqualified good (''honestum''). Then in turn there are three levels of friendship based on each of those levels, namely friendship based on usefulness (''amicitia utilis''), friendship based on pleasure (''amicitia delectabilis''), and friendship rooted in unqualified goodness (''amicitia honesti''; ''amicitia quae fundatur super honestum'').&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Stanley. Reclaiming Moral Agency: The Moral Philosophy of Albert the Great. Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University Of America Press, 2008 p.244&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert is frequently mentioned by [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], who made his doctrine of [[free will]] the basis of his ethical system. In his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', Dante places Albertus with his pupil Thomas Aquinas among the great lovers of wisdom (''Spiriti Sapienti'') in the Heaven of the Sun.
