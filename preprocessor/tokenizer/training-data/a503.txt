{{Arianism}}

In [[Christianity]], '''Arianism''' is a [[Christological]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Arianism|title=Arianism|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; concept which asserts the belief that [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] is the [[Son of God]] who was begotten by [[God the Father]] at a point in time, is distinct from the [[Father]] and is therefore subordinate to the Father.&lt;ref name=&quot;ehrmanblogariusalexander&quot;&gt;https://ehrmanblog.org/the-controversies-about-christ-arius-and-alexander/&lt;/ref&gt; Arian teachings were first attributed to [[Arius]] ([[circa|c.]] AD 256–336), a Christian [[presbyter]] in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]]. The teachings of Arius and his supporters were opposed to the theological views held by [[Homoousian]] Christians, regarding the nature of the [[Trinity]] and the nature of Christ. The Arian [[Christology|concept of Christ]] is based on the belief that the Son of God did not always exist but was begotten by God the Father.&lt;ref name=&quot;ehrmanblogariusalexander&quot;/&gt;

There was a dispute between two interpretations (Arianism and Homoousianism) based upon the theological orthodoxy of the time, both of them attempted to solve its theological dilemmas.&lt;ref name=&quot;ehrmanblogariusalexander&quot;/&gt; So there were, initially, two equally orthodox interpretations which initiated a conflict in order to attract adepts and define the new orthodoxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ehrmanblogariusalexander&quot;/&gt; [[Homoousian]]ism was formally affirmed by the first two [[Ecumenical Council]]s. The Ecumenical [[First Council of Nicaea]] of 325 deemed it to be a heresy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferguson2013&quot;/&gt;  All mainstream branches of Christianity now consider Arianism to be [[Heterodoxy|heterodox]] and [[heresy|heretical]].&lt;ref&gt;Ben Witherington III, The Living Word of God: Rethinking the Theology of the Bible (Waco, TX: Baylor University Press, 2009), p.241.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Everett Ferguson, &quot;The great majority of Christians had no clear views about the nature of the Trinity and they did not understand what was at stake in the issues that surrounded it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferguson2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Everett|last=Ferguson|title=Church History, Volume One: From Christ to the Pre-Reformation: The Rise and Growth of the Church in Its Cultural, Intellectual, and Political Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mRQwAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT267|date=26 November 2013|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=978-0-310-51657-6|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the regional [[First Synod of Tyre]] in 335, Arius was exonerated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Socrates of Constantinople]], ''Church History'', book 1, chapter 33.

Arianism is also used to refer to other [[nontrinitarian]] theological systems of the 4th century, which regarded [[Jesus Christ]]—the Son of God, the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]—as either a begotten being (as in Arianism proper and [[Anomoeanism]]) or as neither uncreated nor created in the sense other beings are created (as in [[Semi-Arianism]]).

==Origin==
{{Main|Arius|Arian controversy}}
Arius had been a pupil of [[Lucian of Antioch]] at [[School of Antioch|Lucian's private academy in Antioch]] and inherited from him a modified form of the teachings of [[Paul of Samosata]].&lt;ref&gt;Leighton Pullan, Early Christian Doctrine, Third Edition, Oxford Church Text Books (New York: Edwin S. Gorham, 1905), p.87.&lt;/ref&gt; He taught that God the Father and the Son of God did not always exist together eternally.&lt;ref name=&quot;ritchies.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Story of the Church - Part 2, Topics 2 &amp; 3|first=Mark S.|last=Ritchie|website=The Story of the Church|url=http://www.ritchies.net/p2wk2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arians taught that the Logos was a divine being begotten by God the Father before the creation of the world, made him a medium through whom everything else was created, and that the Son of God is subordinate to God the Father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=M'Clintock|first=John|title=Cyclopedia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature|author2=James Strong|page=45|volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A verse from Proverbs was also used: &quot;The Lord created me at the beginning of his work&quot; ([[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] {{bibleverse-nb||Proverbs|8:22}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;FiorenzaGalvin1991&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Francis Schüssler Fiorenza|author2=John P.

Controversy over Arianism arose in the late 3rd century and persisted throughout most of the 4th century. It involved most church members—from simple believers, priests, and monks to bishops, emperors, and members of Rome's imperial family. Two Roman emperors, [[Constantius II]] and [[Valens]], became Arians or Semi-Arians, as did prominent [[Goths|Gothic]], [[Vandal]], and [[Lombards|Lombard]] warlords both before and after the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]]. Such a deep controversy within the Church during this period of its development could not have materialized without significant historical influences providing a basis for the Arian doctrines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanson2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanson|first=R P C|title=The Search for the Christian Doctrine of God|year=2007|publisher=Baker Academic|location=Grand Rapids|isbn=0-8010-3146-X|pages=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the roughly three hundred bishops in attendance at the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicea]], two bishops did not sign the [[Nicene Creed]] that condemned Arianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chadwick|first=Henry|title=Faith and Order at the Council of Nicea|journal=The Harvard Theological Review|date=July 1960|volume=53|issue=3|pages=171–195|jstor=1508399|doi=10.1017/S0017816000027000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constantine the Great|Emperor Constantine]] also ordered a penalty of death for those who refused to surrender the Arian writings:

{{quotation|&quot;In addition, if any writing composed by Arius should be found, it should be handed over to the flames, so that not only will the wickedness of his teaching be obliterated, but nothing will be left even to remind anyone of him. And I hereby make a public order, that if someone should be discovered to have hidden a writing composed by Arius, and not to have immediately brought it forward and destroyed it by fire, his penalty shall be death. As soon as he is discovered in this offence, he shall be submitted for capital punishment.&amp;nbsp;... &quot;|Edict by Emperor Constantine against the Arians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourthcentury.com/index.php/urkunde-33 |title=Emperor Constantine's Edict against the Arians |publisher=fourthcentury.com |date=23 January 2010 |accessdate=20 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819215807/http://www.fourthcentury.com/index.php/urkunde-33 |archivedate=19 August 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

==Beliefs==
Reconstructing what Arius actually taught, and why, is a formidable task, both because little of his own work survives except in quotations selected for polemical purposes by his opponents, and also because there is no certainty about what theological and philosophical traditions formed his thought.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bauckham, “Review of Arius: Heresy and Tradition by Rowan Williams,” Themelios: Volume 14, No. 2, January/February 1989, 1989, 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arians do not believe in the traditional doctrine of the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Newton's Arian beliefs|publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics, [[University of St. Andrews]]|location=Scotland|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Extras/Newton_Arian.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter of Arian Auxentius&lt;ref name=&quot;faculty.georgetown.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Auxentius on Wulfila: Translation by Jim Marchand|url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/texts/auxentius.trans.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarding the Arian missionary [[Ulfilas]] gives a picture of Arian beliefs. Arian [[Ulfilas]], who was ordained a bishop by Arian [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]] and returned to his people to work as a missionary, believed: God, the Father, (&quot;unbegotten&quot; God; Almighty God) always existing and who is the only true God (John 17:3). The Son of God, Jesus Christ, (&quot;only-begotten God&quot; John 1:18;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New American Standard Bible {{ndash}} John 1|website=Bible Hub|url=http://biblehub.com/nasb/john/1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mighty God Isaiah 9:6) begotten before time began (Proverbs 8:22-29; Revelation 3:14; Colossians 1:15) and who is Lord/Master (1 Cor 8:6). The Holy Spirit (the illuminating and sanctifying power, who is neither God the Father nor Lord/Master. [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|First Corinthians]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Corinthians|8:5}}-{{bibleverse-nb|1|Corinthians|8:6}} was cited as [[proof text]]:

{{quote|Indeed, even though there may be so-called gods in heaven or on earth — as in fact there are many gods and many lords/masters — yet for us there is one God (Gk. ''theos'' – θεός), the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord/Master (''[[kyrios]]'' – κύριος), Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.|[[NRSV]]}}

The creed of Arian [[Ulfilas]] (c. 311 – 383), which concludes a letter praising him written by Auxentius,&lt;ref name=&quot;faculty.georgetown.edu&quot;/&gt; distinguishes God the Father (&quot;unbegotten&quot;), who is the only true God from Son of God (&quot;only-begotten&quot;), who is Lord/Master; and the Holy Spirit, the illuminating and sanctifying power, who is neither God the Father nor Lord/Master:

{{quote|I, Ulfila, bishop and confessor, have always so believed, and in this, the one true faith, I make the journey to my Lord; I believe in only one God the Father, the unbegotten and invisible, and in his only-begotten son, our Lord/Master and God, the designer and maker of all creation, having none other like him. Therefore, there is one God of all, who is also God of our God; and in one Holy Spirit, the illuminating and sanctifying power, as Christ said after his resurrection to his apostles: &quot;And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you; but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be clothed with power from on high&quot; (Luke 24:49) and again &quot;But ye shall receive power, when the Holy Ghost is come upon you&quot; (Acts 1:8); Neither God nor Lord/Master, but the faithful minister of Christ; not equal, but subject and obedient in all things to the Son. And I believe the Son to be subject and obedient in all things to God the Father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heather and Matthews|title=Goths in the Fourth Century|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; |}}

A letter from [[Arius]] (c. 250–336) to the Arian [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]] (died 341) succinctly states the core beliefs of the Arians:

{{quote|Some of them say that the Son is an eructation, others that he is a production, others that he is also unbegotten. These are impieties to which we cannot listen, even though the heretics threaten us with a thousand deaths. But we say and believe and have taught, and do teach, that the Son is not unbegotten, nor in any way part of the unbegotten; and that he does not derive his subsistence from any matter; but that by his own will and counsel he has subsisted before time and before ages as perfect as God, only begotten and unchangeable, and that before he was begotten, or created, or purposed, or established, he was not. For he was not unbegotten. We are persecuted because we say that the Son has a beginning but that God is without beginning.|Theodoret: Arius's Letter to Eusebius of Nicomedia|translated in Peters' ''Heresy and Authority in [[Medieval Europe]]'', p. 41}}

According to [[Bart Ehrman]], the dispute between Trinitarianism and Arianism was about:

* has the Son always existed next to the Father or was the Son begotten at a certain time in eternity past?
* is the Son equal to the Father or subordinated to the Father?
* for Constantine it was minor theological claptrap that stood in the way of uniting the Empire, but for the theologians it was of huge importance.&lt;ref name=&quot;ehrmanblogariusalexander&quot;/&gt;

==Homoian Arianism==
Arianism had several different variants, including [[Eunomianism]] and [[Acacians|Homoian Arianism]]. Homoian Arianism is associated with [[Acacius of Caesarea|Akakius]] and [[Eudoxius of Antioch|Eudoxius]]. Homoian Arianism avoided the use of the word ''ousia'' to describe the relation of Father to Son, and described these as &quot;like&quot; each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hanson|first1=R.P.C.|title=The Search for the Christian Doctrine of God|date=1988|publisher=T&amp;T Clark|location=Edinburgh|pages=557–558}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson lists twelve creeds that reflect the Homoian faith:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hanson|first1=R.P.C.|title=The Search for the Christian Doctrine of God|date=1988|publisher=T&amp;T Clark|location=Edinburgh|pages=558–559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Struggles with Orthodoxy==

===First Council of Nicaea===
[[File:Constantine burning Arian books.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] burning Arian books, illustration from a compendium of [[canon law]], ''c''. 825.]]

In 321, Arius was denounced by a [[synod]] at Alexandria for teaching a heterodox view of the relationship of Jesus to God the Father. Because Arius and his followers had great influence in the schools of Alexandria—counterparts to modern universities or seminaries—their theological views spread, especially in the eastern Mediterranean.

By 325, the controversy had become significant enough that the [[Emperor Constantine]] called an assembly of bishops, the [[First Council of Nicaea]], which condemned Arius's doctrine and formulated the original [[Nicene Creed#The original Nicene Creed of 325|Nicene Creed of 325]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.vii.iii.html|ref= NPNF2-14|title=The Seven Ecumenical Councils |publisher= Christian Classics Ethereal Library }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nicene Creed's central term, used to describe the relationship between the Father and the Son, is [[Homoousios]] ({{lang-grc|ὁμοούσιος}}), or [[Consubstantiality]], meaning &quot;of the same substance&quot; or &quot;of one being&quot;. (The [[Athanasian Creed]] is less often used but is a more overtly anti-Arian statement on the Trinity.)

The focus of the Council of Nicaea was the nature of the Son of God and his precise relationship to God the Father. (see [[Paul of Samosata]] and the [[Synods of Antioch]]). Arius taught that Jesus Christ was divine/holy and was sent to earth for the salvation of mankind&lt;ref name=&quot;www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk&quot;/&gt; but that Jesus Christ was not equal to God the Father (infinite, primordial origin) in rank ''and'' that God the Father and the Son of God were not equal to the Holy Spirit (power of God the Father).&lt;ref name=&quot;ritchies.net&quot;/&gt; Under Arianism, Christ was instead not consubstantial with God the Father&lt;ref name=Pomazansky&gt;&quot;The oneness of Essence, the Equality of Divinity, and the Equality of Honor of God the Son with the God the Father.&quot; Orthodox Dogmatic Theology: A Concise Exposition Protopresbyter Michael Pomazansky pages 92–95&lt;/ref&gt; since both the Father and the Son under Arius were made of &quot;like&quot; essence or being (see [[homoiousia]]) but not of the same essence or being (see [[homoousia]]).&lt;ref name=Pomazansky/&gt;

In the Arian view, God the Father is a Deity and is divine ''and'' the Son of God is not a Deity but divine (I, the LORD, am Deity alone. Isaiah 46:9).&lt;ref name=&quot;www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk&quot;/&gt; God the Father sent Jesus to earth for salvation of mankind (John 17:3). [[Ousia]] is essence or being, in Eastern Christianity, and is the aspect of God that is completely incomprehensible to mankind and human perception. It is all that subsists by itself and which has not its being in another,&lt;ref&gt;The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church, SVS Press, 1997. ({{ISBN|0-913836-31-1}}) James Clarkef &amp; Co Ltd, 1991. ({{ISBN|0-227-67919-9}}) V Lossky pg&amp;nbsp;50–51&lt;/ref&gt; God the Father and God the Son and God the Holy Spirit all being uncreated.&lt;ref&gt;Orthodox Dogmatic Theology: A Concise Exposition Protopresbyter Michael Pomazansky pages 57 As quoted by [[John Damascene]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;God is unoriginate, unending, eternal, constant, uncreated, unchanging, unalterable, simple, incomplex, bodiless, invisible, intangible, indescribable, without bounds, inaccessible to the mind, uncontainable, incomprehensible, good, righteous, that Creator of all creatures, the almighty [[Pantocrator]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the teaching of Arius, the pre-existent Logos and thus the incarnate Jesus Christ was a begotten being; only the Son was directly begotten by God the Father, before ages, but was of a distinct, though similar, essence or substance from the Creator. His opponents argued that this would make Jesus less than God and that this was heretical.&lt;ref name=Pomazansky/&gt; Much of the distinction between the differing factions was over the phrasing that Christ expressed in the New Testament to express submission to God the Father.&lt;ref name=Pomazansky/&gt; The theological term for this submission is [[kenosis]]. This Ecumenical council declared that Jesus Christ was a distinct being of God in existence or reality ([[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]]), which the Latin fathers translated as persona. Jesus was God in essence, being, and/or nature (ousia), which the Latin fathers translated as substantia.

Constantine is believed to have exiled those who refused to accept the Nicean creed—Arius himself, the deacon Euzoios, and the Libyan bishops Theonas of Marmarica and [[Secundus of Ptolemais]]—and also the bishops who signed the creed but refused to join in condemnation of Arius, Eusebius of Nicomedia and [[Theognis of Nicaea]]. The Emperor also ordered all copies of the ''Thalia'', the book in which Arius had expressed his teachings, to be [[Book burning|burned]]. However, there is no evidence that his son and ultimate successor, [[Constantius II]], who was an Arian Christian, was exiled.

Although he was committed to maintaining what the church had defined at Nicaea, Constantine was also bent on pacifying the situation and eventually became more lenient toward those condemned and exiled at the council. First he allowed Eusebius of Nicomedia, who was a protégé of his sister, and Theognis to return once they had signed an ambiguous statement of faith. The two, and other friends of Arius, worked for Arius's rehabilitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jonathan Kirsch 2004&quot;&gt;Edward Gibbons &quot;The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, Chapter 21, (1776–88), Jonathan Kirsch, &quot;God Against the Gods: The History of the War Between Monotheism and Polytheism&quot;, 2004, and [[Charles Freeman (historian)|Charles Freeman]], ''[[The Closing of the Western Mind]]: The Rise of Faith and the Fall of Reason'', 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[First Synod of Tyre]] in AD 335, they brought accusations against [[Pope Athanasius I of Alexandria|Athanasius]], now bishop of Alexandria, the primary opponent of Arius. After this, Constantine had Athanasius banished since he considered him an impediment to reconciliation. In the same year, the Synod of Jerusalem under Constantine's direction readmitted [[Arius]] to communion in AD 336. Arius died on the way to this event in Constantinople. Some scholars suggest that Arius may have been poisoned by his opponents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jonathan Kirsch 2004&quot;/&gt; Eusebius and Theognis remained in the Emperor's favor, and when Constantine, who had been a [[catechumen]] much of his adult life, accepted [[baptism]] on his deathbed, it was from Eusebius of Nicomedia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gonzalez 1984 176&quot;/&gt;

The historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]] wrote of the Council:
{{quote|It is one of the most intolerable spectacles in all history to see the Church, barely saved from [[Diocletianic Persecution|persecution]]...wholly consumed in strenuous conflict over the relations of the three Persons of the [[Trinity]].  Oriental rigidity and Greek sophistry, equally represented in the episcopal thrones, tormented themselves and the letter of Scripture to produce some symbol which would make the incomprehensible comprehensible and to give general validity to some expression of the idea. From  ''homoousios'' and ''homoiousios'' (&quot;equal&quot; and &quot;similar&quot;) the conflict proceeded through a hundred metamorphoses and several hundred years and split the Eastern Church into sects.... A host of other interests, in part very worldly, attached themselves to the conflict and were concealed in it, so that it assumes the aspect of a merely hypocritical pretext.  For the sake of this quarrel the Church made itself inwardly hollow; for the sake of orthodox dogma it suffered the inward man to be famished, and, itself demoralized, it completely forfeited its higher moral effect upon the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burckhardt|first1=Jacob|title=The Age of Constantine the Great|date=1852|publisher=Univ California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04680-1|pages=312-313}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Aftermath of Nicaea===
The Council of Nicaea did not end the controversy, as many bishops of the Eastern provinces disputed the ''[[homoousios]]'', the central term of the Nicene creed, as it had been used by [[Paul of Samosata]], who had advocated a [[Monarchianism|monarchianist]] [[Christology]]. Both the man and his teaching, including the term ''homoousios'', had been condemned by the [[Synods of Antioch]] in 269.

Hence, after Constantine's death in 337, open dispute resumed again. Constantine's son [[Constantius II]], who had become Emperor of the eastern part of the Empire, actually encouraged the Arians and set out to reverse the Nicene creed. His advisor in these affairs was Eusebius of Nicomedia, who had already at the Council of Nicea been the head of the Arian party, who also was made bishop of Constantinople.

Constantius used his power to exile bishops adhering to the Nicene creed, especially St [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], who fled to Rome. In 355 Constantius became the sole Emperor and extended his pro-Arian policy toward the western provinces, frequently using force to push through his creed, even exiling [[Pope Liberius]] and installing [[Antipope Felix II]].

The third [[Council of Sirmium]] in 357 was the high point of Arianism. The Seventh Arian Confession (Second Sirmium Confession) held that both ''homoousios'' (of one substance) and ''homoiousios'' (of similar substance) were unbiblical and that the Father is greater than the Son. (This confession was later known as the Blasphemy of Sirmium.)

&lt;blockquote&gt;
But since many persons are disturbed by questions concerning what is called in Latin ''substantia'', but in Greek ''ousia'', that is, to make it understood more exactly, as to 'coessential,' or what is called, 'like-in-essence,' there ought to be no mention of any of these at all, nor exposition of them in the Church, for this reason and for this consideration, that in divine Scripture nothing is written about them, and that they are above men's knowledge and above men's understanding;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fourthcentury.com/index.php/second-creed-of-sirmium-or-the-blasphemy-of-sirmium/|title=Second Creed of Sirmium or &quot;The Blasphemy of Sirmium&quot;|website=www.fourthcentury.com|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As debates raged in an attempt to come up with a new formula, three camps evolved among the opponents of the Nicene creed. The first group mainly opposed the Nicene terminology and preferred the term ''homoiousios'' (alike in substance) to the Nicene ''homoousios'', while they rejected Arius and his teaching and accepted the equality and coeternality of the persons of the Trinity. Because of this centrist position, and despite their rejection of Arius, they were called &quot;semi-Arians&quot; by their opponents. The second group also avoided invoking the name of Arius, but in large part followed Arius' teachings and, in another attempted compromise wording, described the Son as being like (''[[Acacians|homoios]]'') the Father. A third group explicitly called upon Arius and described the Son as unlike (''[[Anomoeanism|anhomoios]]'') the Father. Constantius wavered in his support between the first and the second party, while harshly persecuting the third.

[[Epiphanius of Salamis]] labelled the party of [[Basil of Ancyra]] in 358 &quot;[[Semi-Arianism]]&quot;. This is considered unfair by Kelly who states that some members of the group were virtually orthodox from the start but disliked the adjective ''homoousios'' while others had moved in that direction after the out-and-out Arians had come into the open.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly J.N.D. ''Early Christian Doctrines'' A&amp;G Black 1965, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

The debates among these groups resulted in numerous synods, among them the [[Council of Sardica]] in 343, the [[Council of Sirmium]] in 358 and the double [[Council of Rimini]] and Seleucia in 359, and no fewer than fourteen further creed formulas between 340 and 360, leading the pagan observer [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] to comment sarcastically: &quot;The highways were covered with galloping bishops.&quot; None of these attempts were acceptable to the defenders of Nicene orthodoxy: writing about the latter councils, Saint [[Jerome]] remarked that the world &quot;awoke with a groan to find itself Arian.&quot;

After Constantius' death in 361, his successor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], a devotee of [[State religion of Rome|Rome's pagan gods]], declared that he would no longer attempt to favor one church faction over another, and allowed all exiled bishops to return; this resulted in further increasing dissension among Nicene Christians. The Emperor [[Valens]], however, revived Constantius' policy and supported the &quot;Homoian&quot; party, exiling bishops and often using force. During this persecution many bishops were exiled to the other ends of the Empire, (e.g., [[St Hilary of Poitiers]] to the Eastern provinces). These contacts and the common plight subsequently led to a rapprochement between the Western supporters of the Nicene creed and the ''homoousios'' and the Eastern semi-Arians.

===Council of Constantinople===
{{Main|Theodosius I}}
It was not until the co-reigns of Gratian and Theodosius that Arianism was effectively wiped out among the ruling class and elite of the Eastern Empire. Theodosius' wife St [[Aelia Flacilla|Flacilla]] was instrumental in his campaign to end Arianism. Valens died in the [[Battle of Adrianople (378)|Battle of Adrianople]] in 378 and was succeeded by [[Theodosius I]], who adhered to the Nicene creed. This allowed for settling the dispute.

Two days after Theodosius arrived in Constantinople, 24 November 380, he expelled the [[Homoiousian]] bishop, [[Demophilus of Constantinople]], and surrendered the churches of that city to [[Gregory Nazianzus]], the leader of the rather small Nicene community there, an act which provoked rioting. Theodosius had just been baptized, by bishop Acholius of Thessalonica, during a severe illness, as was common in the early Christian world. In February he and [[Gratian]] had published an edict&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf202.iii.xii.iv.html |title=Sozomen's Church History VII.4 |publisher=ccel.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; that all their subjects should profess the faith of the bishops of Rome and Alexandria (i.e., the Nicene faith), or be handed over for punishment for not doing so.

Although much of the church hierarchy in the East had opposed the Nicene creed in the decades leading up to Theodosius' accession, he managed to achieve unity on the basis of the Nicene creed. In 381, at the [[First Council of Constantinople|Second Ecumenical Council]] in Constantinople, a group of mainly Eastern bishops assembled and accepted the [[Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed|Nicene Creed of 381]],&lt;ref&gt;The text of this version of the [[Nicene creed]] is available at {{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.ix.iii.html |title=The Holy Creed Which the 150 Holy Fathers Set Forth, Which is Consonant with the Holy and Great Synod of Nice |publisher=ccel.org |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was supplemented in regard to the [[Holy Spirit]], as well as some other changes: see [[Comparison of Nicene Creeds of 325 and 381|Comparison between Creed of 325 and Creed of 381]]. This is generally considered the end of the dispute about the Trinity and the end of Arianism among the Roman, non-Germanic peoples.

==Among medieval Germanic tribes==
{{Main|Gothic Christianity|Germanic Christianity}}

[[File:Baptism of Christ - Arian Baptistry - Ravenna 2016.jpg|thumb|300px|The ceiling mosaic of the [[Arian Baptistry]].]]
During the time of Arianism's flowering in [[Constantinople]], the Gothic convert [[Ulfilas]] (later the subject of the letter of Auxentius cited above) was sent as a missionary to the Gothic barbarians across the [[Danube River|Danube]], a mission favored for political reasons by emperor Constantius II. Ulfilas' initial success in converting this Germanic people to an Arian form of Christianity was strengthened by later events. When the Germanic peoples entered the provinces of the [[Western Roman Empire]] and began founding their own kingdoms there, most had been Arian Christians for more than a century.

The conflict in the 4th century AD had seen Arian and Nicene factions struggling for control of the Church. In contrast, among the Arian German kingdoms established in the collapsing Western Empire in the 5th century, there were entirely separate Arian and Nicene Churches with parallel hierarchies, each serving different sets of believers. The Germanic elites were Arians, and the Romance majority population was Nicene.

Most Germanic tribes were generally tolerant of the Nicene beliefs of their subjects. However, the Vandals tried for several decades to force their Arian beliefs on their North African Nicene subjects, exiling Nicene clergy, dissolving monasteries, and exercising heavy pressure on non-conforming Nicene Christians.

The apparent resurgence of Arianism after Nicaea was more an anti-Nicene reaction exploited by Arian sympathizers than a pro-Arian development.&lt;ref&gt;Everett Ferguson, Church History: From Christ to Pre-Reformation, vol. 1 (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 2005), 200.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the 4th century it had surrendered its remaining ground to [[Trinitarianism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;carm&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://carm.org/arianism-and-its-influence-today|title=Arianism and Its Influence Today&amp;#124;Arius&amp;#124;Idea That Jesus Christ Is Not Equal to the Father By Nature|publisher=carm.org|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In western Europe, Arianism, which had been taught by [[Ulfilas]], the Arian missionary to the barbarian Germanic tribes, was dominant among the [[Goths]], [[Lombards]] and [[Vandals]]. By the 8th century it had ceased to be the tribes' mainstream belief as the tribal rulers gradually came to adopt Nicene orthodoxy. This trend began in 496 with Clovis I of the Franks, then [[Reccared I]] of the [[Visigoths]] in 587 and [[Aripert I]] of the [[Lombards]] in 653.

The [[Franks]] and the [[Anglo-Saxons]] were unlike the other Germanic peoples in that they entered the empire as pagans and converted to [[Chalcedonian Christianity]] directly, guided by their kings, [[Clovis I|Clovis]]&lt;ref&gt;Frassetto, Michael, ''Encyclopedia of barbarian Europe'', (ABC-CLIO, 2003), 128.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Æthelberht of Kent]]. The remaining tribes – the Vandals and the Ostrogoths – did not convert as a people nor did they maintain territorial cohesion. Having been militarily defeated by the armies of [[Emperor Justinian I]], the remnants were dispersed to the fringes of the empire and became lost to history. The [[Vandalic War]] of 533–534 dispersed the defeated Vandals.&lt;ref&gt;Procopius, Secret Histories, Chapter 11, 18&lt;/ref&gt; Following their final defeat at the [[Battle of Mons Lactarius]] in 553, the [[Ostrogoths]] went back north and (re)settled in south Austria.
[[File:PalatiumTheodoricMosaicDetail.jpg|thumb|Once the Orthodox Trinitarians succeeded in defeating Arianism, they censored any signs that the perceived heresy left behind. This mosaic in [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo]] in Ravenna has had images of the Arian king, Theoderic, and his court removed. On some columns their hands remain.]]

==From the 5th to the 7th century==
Much of south-eastern Europe and [[central Europe]], including many of the [[Goths]] and [[Vandals]] respectively, had embraced Arianism (the [[Visigoths]] converted to Arian Christianity in 376), which led to Arianism being a religious factor in various wars in the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{quote|The inhibiting and paralyzing force of superstitious beliefs penetrated to every department of life, and the most primary and elementary activities of society were influenced. War, for example, was not a simple matter of a test of strength and courage, but supernatural matters had to be taken carefully into consideration. When [[Clovis I|Clovis]] said of the Goths in southern Gaul, &quot;I take it hard that these Arians should hold a part of the Gauls; let us go with God's aid and conquer them and bring the land under our dominion&quot;, [note: see p. 45 (Book II:37)] he was not speaking in a hypocritical or arrogant manner but in real accordance with the religious sentiment of the time. What he meant was that the Goths, being heretics, were at once enemies of the true God and inferior to the orthodox Franks in their supernatural backing. Considerations of duty, strategy, and self-interest all reinforced one another in [[Clovis I|Clovis]]'s mind. However, it was not always the orthodox side that won. We hear of a battle fought a few years before Gregory became bishop of Tours between king [[Sigebert I|Sigibert]] and the [[Huns]], [note: Book IV:29] in which the Huns &quot;by the use of magic arts caused various false appearances to arise before their enemies and overcame them decisively.&quot; Medieval Study Guide to Gregory of Tours History of the Franks.|St [[Gregory of Tours]] |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/gregory-hist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the west, organized Arianism survived in [[North Africa]], in Hispania, and parts of Italy until it was finally suppressed in the 6th and 7th centuries. [[Grimoald I of Benevento|Grimwald]], [[King of the Lombards]] (662–671), and his young son and successor [[Garibald]] (671), were the last Arian kings in Europe.

==From the 16th to the 19th century==
Following the [[Protestant Reformation]] from 1517, it did not take long for Arian and other [[non-trinitarian]] views to resurface. The first recorded English [[antitrinitarian]] was [[John Assheton]] who was forced to recant before [[Thomas Cranmer]] in 1548. At the [[Anabaptist]] [[Council of Venice]] 1550, the early Italian instigators of the [[Radical Reformation]] committed to the views of [[Servetus|Miguel Servetus]] (burned alive by [[John Calvin|Calvin]] in 1553), and these were promulgated by [[Giorgio Biandrata]] and others into Poland and Transylvania.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Bainton]], ''Hunted Heretic. The Life and Death of Michael Servetus''&lt;/ref&gt;

The antitrinitarian wing of the Polish Reformation separated from the [[Calvinist]] ''ecclesia maior'' to form the ''ecclesia minor'' or [[Polish Brethren]]. These were commonly referred to as &quot;Arians&quot; due to their rejection of the Trinity, though in fact the [[Socinians]], as they were later known, went further than Arius to the position of [[Photinus]]. The epithet &quot;Arian&quot; was also applied to the early [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] such as [[John Biddle (Unitarian)|John Biddle]] though in denial of the [[pre-existence of Christ]] they were again largely Socinians not Arians.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Huntston Williams]]. ''The Radical Reformation'', 3rd edition. Volume 15 of Sixteenth Century Essays and Studies. Ann Arbor, MI: Edwards Brothers, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century the &quot;dominant trend&quot; in Britain, particularly in [[Latitudinarianism]], was towards Arianism, with which the names of [[Samuel Clarke]], [[Benjamin Hoadly]], [[William Whiston]] and [[Isaac Newton]] are associated.&lt;ref&gt;William Gibson, Robert G. Ingram ''Religious identities in Britain, 1660–1832'' p92&lt;/ref&gt; To quote the ''Encyclopædia Britannica''{{'s}} article on Arianism: &quot;In modern times some [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] are virtually Arians in that they are unwilling either to reduce Christ to a mere human being or to attribute to him a divine nature identical with that of the Father.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Arianism.&quot; Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica 2007 Deluxe Edition. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, their doctrines cannot be considered representative of traditional Arian doctrines or vice versa.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

A similar view was held by the ancient anti-Nicene [[Pneumatomachi]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Πνευματομάχοι}}, &quot;breath&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot; and &quot;fighters&quot;, combining as &quot;fighters against the spirit&quot;), so called because they opposed the deifying of the Nicene Holy Ghost. However, the Pneumatomachi were adherents of [[Macedonianism]], and though their beliefs were somewhat reminiscent of Arianism,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wace&quot;&gt;Wace, Henry; Piercy, William C., eds. Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature to the End of the Sixth Century (1911, third edition) London: John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; they were distinct enough to be distinguishably different.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wace&quot;/&gt;

The [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] is one of the largest groups that teaches a similar doctrine, though they are really closer to Socinianism, believing the Word in John 1:1 is God's plan of salvation, not Christ. So Christ did not preexist.

== Today ==

The original Arians also generally prayed directly to Jesus, whereas the Witnesses pray to God, through Jesus as a mediator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Should You Believe in the Trinity?|journal=Awake!|date=August 2013|pages=12–13|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/102013286|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adherents===
The teachings of the first two ecumenical councils – which entirely reject Arianism – are held by the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and all churches founded during the [[Reformation]] in the 16th century or influenced by it ([[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Calvinism|Reformed]]/[[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]]). Also, nearly all [[Protestantism|Protestant]] groups (such as [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[Baptists]], and most [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]]) entirely reject the teachings associated with Arianism. Modern groups which currently appear to embrace some of the principles of Arianism include [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. Although the origins of their beliefs are not necessarily attributed to the teachings of Arius, many of the core beliefs of Unitarians and Jehovah's Witnesses are entirely similar to them.

Other groups which oppose the belief in the Trinity are not necessarily Arian.
* The [[Iglesia ni Cristo]],&lt;ref&gt;Bienvenido Santiago &quot;Is Jesus Christ Called 'God' in John 1:1?&quot; in God's Message magazine July–September 1995&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christadelphians]],&lt;ref&gt;Pearce F.

CMPA&lt;/ref&gt; [[Church of God General Conference]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Sir Anthony Buzzard, 3rd Baronet|Anthony Buzzard]] and Charles Hunting ''The Doctrine of the Trinity: Christianity's Self-Inflicted Wound''&lt;/ref&gt; and other &quot;[[Biblical Unitarian]]s&quot; are typically [[Socinianism|Socinian]] in their Christology, not Arian.
* There are also various [[Binitarian]] churches, which basically believe that God is two persons, the Father and the Son, but they believe that the Holy Spirit is not a person. They include the [[Church of God (Seventh Day)]] and its various offshoots, in particular the former Radio Church of God, founded by Herbert W. Armstrong, renamed the [[Worldwide Church of God]], which after Armstrong's death converted to Trinitarianism, causing many small breakaway churches to form, and most of them remain loyal to the teachings of Armstrong, for example the [[Restored Church of God]], the [[United Church of God]], the [[Philadelphia Church of God]], the [[Living Church of God]], and many others. Other Binitarian churches include the Gospel Assemblies, a group of Pentecostal denominations which believe that God adopted the name Jesus, and the [[Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)]], an offshoot of [[Mormonism]], which believes that God is two personages, not two persons. Binitarian churches generally believe that the Father is greater than the Son, a view somewhat similar to Arianism.
