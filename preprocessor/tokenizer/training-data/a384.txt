'''{{lang|fr|Anatole France}}''' ({{IPA-fr|anatɔl fʁɑ̃s|lang}}; born '''{{lang|fr|François-Anatole Thibault}}''', {{IPA-fr|frɑ̃swa anatɔl tibo|}}; 16 April 1844 – 12 October 1924) was a French poet, journalist, and novelist. He was a successful novelist, with several best-sellers. Ironic and skeptical, he was considered in his day the ideal French man of letters. He was a member of the ''{{lang|fr|[[Académie française]]}}'', and won the 1921 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] &quot;in recognition of his brilliant literary achievements, characterized as they are by a nobility of style, a profound human sympathy, grace, and a true [[French people|Gallic]] temperament&quot;.
France is also widely believed to be the model for narrator Marcel's literary idol {{lang|fr|Bergotte}} in {{lang|fr|[[Marcel Proust]]}}'s ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title={{lang|fr|Marcel Proust|nocat=y}}: A Life, by Edmund White |url=http://tenpagesormore.blogspot.com/2010/07/3-marcel-proust-life-by-edmund-white-pp.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
The son of a bookseller, France spent most of his life around books and was a [[bibliophile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://benonsensical.com/blog/tag/famous-bibliophiles |title=Anatole France |work=benonsensical |date=24 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father's bookstore, called the ''{{lang|fr|Librairie France}}'', specialized in books and papers on the [[French Revolution]] and was frequented by many notable writers and scholars of the day. France studied at the ''{{lang|fr|[[Collège Stanislas de Paris|Collège Stanislas]]}}'', a private Catholic school, and after graduation he helped his father by working in his bookstore. After several years he secured the position of cataloguer at {{lang|fr|Bacheline-Deflorenne}} and at {{lang|fr|Lemerre}}. In 1876 he was appointed librarian for the French Senate.

==Literary career==
Anatole France began his literary career as a poet and a journalist. In 1869, ''{{lang|fr|Le Parnasse Contemporain}}'' published one of his poems, ''{{lang|fr|La Part de Madeleine}}''. In 1875, he sat on the committee which was in charge of the third ''{{lang|fr|Parnasse Contemporain}}'' compilation. As a journalist, from 1867, he wrote many articles and notices. He became famous with the novel ''{{lang|fr|Le Crime de Sylvestre Bonnard}}'' (1881). Its protagonist, skeptical old scholar Sylvester Bonnard, embodied France's own personality. The novel was praised for its elegant prose and won him a prize from the {{lang|fr|Académie française}}. [[File:Anatole France house, Villa Said.jpg|thumb|left|140px|France's home, 5 {{lang|fr|villa Saïd}}, 1894–1924]]
In ''{{lang|fr|La Rotisserie de la Reine Pedauque}}'' (1893) Anatole France ridiculed belief in the occult; and in ''{{lang|fr|Les Opinions de Jérôme Coignard}}'' (1893), France captured the atmosphere of the ''{{lang|fr|[[fin de siècle]]}}''. France was elected to the ''{{lang|fr|Académie française}}'' in 1896.

Anatole France took an important part in the [[Dreyfus affair]]. He signed {{lang|fr|[[Émile Zola]]}}'s manifesto supporting [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a Jewish army officer who had been falsely convicted of [[espionage]]. France wrote about the affair in his 1901 novel ''{{lang|fr|Monsieur Bergeret}}''.

France's later works include ''{{lang|fr|[[Penguin Island (novel)|L'Île des Pingouins]]}}'' (1908) which satirizes human nature by depicting the transformation of penguins into humans – after the animals have been baptized by mistake by the nearsighted Abbot {{lang|fr|Mael}}. It is a satirical [[history of France]], starting in Medieval times, going on to the writer's own time with special attention to the [[Dreyfus Affair]] and concluding with a [[dystopia]]n future. ''{{lang|fr|[[The Gods Are Athirst|Les dieux ont soif]]}}'' (1912) is a novel, set in Paris during the [[French Revolution]], about a true-believing follower of {{lang|fr|[[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]]}} and his contribution to the bloody events of the [[Reign of Terror]] of 1793–94. It is a wake-up call against political and ideological fanaticism and explores various other philosophical approaches to the events of the time. ''{{lang|fr|[[Revolt of the Angels|La Revolte des Anges]]}}'' (1914) is often considered Anatole France's most profound novel. Loosely based on the Christian understanding of the [[War in Heaven]], it tells the story of Arcade, the guardian angel of {{lang|fr|Maurice d'Esparvieu}}. Arcade falls in love, joins the revolutionary movement of angels, and towards the end realizes that the overthrow of God is meaningless unless &quot;in ourselves and in ourselves alone we attack and destroy [[Demiurge|Ialdabaoth]].&quot;

He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921. He died in 1924 and is buried in the [[Neuilly-sur-Seine community cemetery|{{lang|fr|Neuilly-sur-Seine|nocat=y}} community cemetery]] near Paris.

On 31 May 1922,  France's entire works were put on the ''{{lang|la|[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]}}'' (Prohibited Books Index) of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/indexlibrorum.html |title=Modern History Sourcebook: ''{{lang|la|Index librorum prohibitorum|nocat=y}}'', 1557–1966 (Index of Prohibited Books) |first=Paul |last=Halsall |date=May 1998 |publisher=[[Internet History Sourcebooks Project]] ([[Fordham University]]) }}&lt;/ref&gt; He regarded this as a &quot;distinction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Current Opinion'', September 1922, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; This Index was abolished in 1966.

==Private life==
In 1877, Anatole France married {{lang|fr|Valérie Guérin de Sauville}}, a granddaughter of {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Urbain Guérin|fr}} a [[miniaturist]] who painted Louis XVI,&lt;ref name=&quot;Leduc2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author={{lang|fr|Édouard Leduc|nocat=y}} |title={{lang|fr|Anatole France avant l'oubli|nocat=y}} |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lRpAHOLmpF4C&amp;pg=PA222 |accessdate=12 June 2013 |year=2004 |publisher=Éditions Publibook |isbn=978-2-7483-0397-1 |pages=219, 222–}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he had a daughter, Suzanne, in 1881 (dec. 1918). France's relations with women were always turbulent, and in 1888 he began a relationship with {{lang|fr|[[Léontine Lippmann|Madame Arman de Caillavet]]}}, who conducted a celebrated literary salon of the [[Third Republic of France|Third Republic]]; the affair lasted until shortly before her death in 1910.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leduc2004&quot;/&gt; After his divorce in 1893, he had many liaisons, notably with {{lang|fr|Mme Gagey}}, who committed suicide in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leduc|first1=Edouard|title=Anatole France avant l'oubli|publisher=Editions Publibook|isbn=9782748303971|page=223|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lRpAHOLmpF4C&amp;pg=PA223|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; France married again in 1920, {{lang|fr|Emma Laprévotte}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lahy-Hollebecque&quot;&gt;{{lang|fr|Lahy-Hollebecque, M}}. (1924). ''{{lang|fr|Anatole France et la femme}}''. {{lang|fr|Baudinière}}, 1924, 252 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically, Anatole France was a [[socialist]] and an outspoken supporter of the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]]. In 1920, he gave his support to the newly founded [[French Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Anatole+France |title=Anatole France |encyclopedia=The Free Dictionary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/anatole-france-694.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://mereinkling.net/2014/08/11/introducing-anatole-france/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation==
After his death in 1924 France was the object of written attacks, including a particularly venomous one from the Nazi [[collaborationism|collaborator]], {{lang|fr|[[Pierre Drieu La Rochelle|Pierre Drieu la Rochelle]]}}, and detractors decided he was a vulgar and derivative writer. An admirer, the English writer [[George Orwell]], defended him however and declared that he remained very readable, and that &quot;it is unquestionable that he was attacked partly from political motive.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = What Is Fiction For?: Literary Humanism Restored|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ec1uBgAAQBAJ|publisher = Indiana University Press|date = 2014-12-29|isbn = 9780253014122|language = en|first = Bernard|last = Harrison}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anatole France was also documented to have a [[brain size]] just three-quarters the average weight, and racial anthropologist [[Arthur Keith]] argued that this correlated well with the fact that his life had demonstrated that he was in many ways &quot;a primitive man&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=2525321 |title=The Brain of Anatole France |journal=British Medical Journal|volume=2 |issue=3491 |pages=1048–1049 |year=1927 |author1=Keith |first1=A }}&lt;/ref&gt;
