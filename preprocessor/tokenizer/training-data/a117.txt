Early in his career Huxley edited the magazine ''[[Oxford Poetry]]'' and published short stories and poetry. Mid career and later, he published travel writing, film stories, and scripts. He spent the later part of his life in the United States, living in [[Los Angeles]] from 1937 until his death. In 1962, a year before his death, he was elected Companion of Literature by the [[Royal Society of Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rslit.org/companions-of-literature &quot;Companions of Literature&quot;].

Huxley was born in [[Godalming]], Surrey, England, in 1894. He was the third son of the writer and schoolmaster [[Leonard Huxley (writer)|Leonard Huxley,]] who edited ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.nls.uk/jma/topics/publishing/cornhill.html|title=Cornhill Magazine – The John Murray Archive – National Library of Scotland|website=digital.nls.uk|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his first wife, Julia Arnold, who founded [[Prior's Field School]]. Julia was the niece of poet and critic [[Matthew Arnold]] and the sister of [[Mary Augusta Ward|Mrs. Humphrey Ward]]. Aldous was the grandson of [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], the [[Zoology|zoologist]], agnostic, and controversialist (&quot;Darwin's Bulldog&quot;). His brother [[Julian Huxley]] and half-brother [[Andrew Huxley]] also became outstanding biologists. Aldous had another brother, Noel Trevelyan Huxley (1891–1914), who committed suicide after a period of [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Charles Mason (1978) ''Aldous Huxley and the Way to Reality.'' Greenwood Press, 1978, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Huxley's nickname was &quot;Ogie&quot;, short for &quot;Ogre&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aldous Huxley|last=Bedford|first=Sybille|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf / Harper &amp; Row|year=1974|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was described by his brother, Julian, as someone who frequently &quot;[contemplated] the strangeness of things&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; According to his cousin and contemporary, Gervas Huxley, he had an early interest in drawing.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Huxley's education began in his father's well-equipped botanical laboratory, after which he enrolled at Hillside School near [[Godalming]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hull2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=James Hull|title=Aldous Huxley, Representative Man|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bX3EAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6|year=2004|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-8258-7663-0|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rintoul2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=M.C.

After Hillside, he went on to [[Eton College]]. His mother died in 1908 when he was 14. In 1911 he contracted the eye disease ([[Keratitis|keratitis punctata]]) which &quot;left [him] practically blind for two to three years&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Huxley | first=Aldous |year=1939 |chapter=Biography and bibliography (appendix) |title=After Many A Summer Dies The Swan | series = 1st Perennial Classic |page=243 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row}}&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;ended his early dreams of becoming a doctor.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brave New World|last=Huxley|first=Aldous|publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics / HarperCollins Publishers|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Aldous Huxley: A Life of the Mind}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1913, Huxley went up to [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he read English Literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reiff&quot; /&gt; In January 1916, he volunteered to join the [[British Army]] in the [[World War I|Great War]], but was rejected on health grounds, being half-blind in one eye.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reiff&quot;&gt;Raychel Haugrud Reiff (2009). &quot;Aldous Huxley: Brave New World&quot;. p. 112. Marshall Cavendish&lt;/ref&gt; His eyesight later partly recovered. In 1916 he edited ''[[Oxford Poetry]]'' and in June of that year graduated [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] with [[British undergraduate degree classification#First Class Honours|First Class honours]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Reiff&quot; /&gt; His brother Julian wrote:

{{Quote|I believe his blindness was a blessing in disguise. For one thing, it put paid to his idea of taking up medicine as a career&amp;nbsp;... His uniqueness lay in his universalism. He was able to take all knowledge for his province.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Huxley 1965. ''Aldous Huxley 1894–1963: a Memorial Volume''. Chatto &amp; Windus, London. p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following his years at Balliol, Huxley, being financially indebted to his father, decided to find employment. From April to July 1917, he was in charge of ordering supplies at the [[Air Ministry]] &lt;!-- for the [[Royal Air Force]] (can't be true; was founded following year!) --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Murray (2009). &quot;Aldous Huxley: An English Intellectual&quot;. Chapter 7. p. 4. Hachette&lt;/ref&gt; He taught French for a year at [[Eton College|Eton]], where Eric Blair (who was to take the pen name [[George Orwell]]) and [[Steven Runciman]] were among his pupils. He was mainly remembered as being an incompetent schoolmaster unable to keep order in class. Nevertheless, Blair and others spoke highly of his brilliant command of language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crick&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Crick |first= Bernard | title = George Orwell: A Life |year=1992 |publisher=Penguin Books | location =London |isbn=978-0-14-014563-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significantly, Huxley also worked for a time during the 1920s at [[Tata Chemicals Europe|Brunner and Mond]], a high-tech chemical plant in [[Billingham]] in [[County Durham]], northeast England. According to the introduction to the latest edition of his great science fiction novel ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932), the experience he had there of &quot;an ordered universe in a world of planless incoherence&quot; was an important source for the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Baggini |first= Julian |title=Atheism |url= https://books.google.com/?id=DUal7eYmEnEC&amp;pg=PA86 |year=2009 |publisher = Sterling |isbn = 978-1-4027-6882-8 |page= 86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Huxley completed his first (unpublished) novel at the age of 17 and began writing seriously in his early 20s, establishing himself as a successful writer and social satirist. His first published novels were social satires, ''[[Crome Yellow]]'' (1921), ''[[Antic Hay]]'' (1923), ''[[Those Barren Leaves]]'' (1925), and ''[[Point Counter Point]]'' (1928). ''Brave New World'' was Huxley's fifth novel and first dystopian work. In the 1920s he was also a contributor to ''[[Vanity Fair (American magazine 1913–1936)|Vanity Fair]]'' and [[Vogue (British magazine)|British ''Vogue'']] magazines.&lt;ref&gt;Aldous Huxley: Selected Letters&quot;. p. 144. Ivan R. Dee, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bloomsbury Set ===
[[File:SomeBloomsburymembers.jpg|thumb|right|Left to right: [[Bloomsbury Group]] members [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]], Maria Nys, [[Lytton Strachey]], [[Duncan Grant]], and [[Vanessa Bell]] ]]
During World War I, Huxley spent much of his time at [[Garsington Manor]] near Oxford, home of [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]], working as a farm labourer. There he met several [[Bloomsbury Group|Bloomsbury]] figures, including [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Alfred North Whitehead]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Weber | first = Michel | author-link = Michel Weber | url = https://www.academia.edu/3268912/_On_Religiousness_and_Religion._Huxleys_Reading_of_Whiteheads_Religion_in_the_Making_in_the_Light_of_James_Varieties_of_Religious_Experience_2005_ | title = On Religiousness and Religion.

Later, in ''[[Crome Yellow]]'' (1921) he caricatured the Garsington lifestyle. Jobs were very scarce, but in 1919 [[John Middleton Murry]] was reorganising the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' and invited Huxley to join the staff. He accepted immediately, and quickly married the Belgian refugee Maria Nys, also at Garsington.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Huxleys | first = Ronald W | last = Clark | publisher = William Heinemann | place = London | year = 1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They lived with their young son in Italy part of the time during the 1920s, where Huxley would visit his friend [[D. H. Lawrence]]. Following Lawrence's death in 1930, Huxley edited Lawrence's letters (1932).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = George | last = Woodcock | year = 2007 | title = Dawn and the Darkest Hour: A Study of Aldous Huxley | page = 240 | publisher=Black Rose Books}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Works of this period included important novels on the dehumanising aspects of scientific progress, most famously ''[[Brave New World]]'', and on pacifist themes (for example, ''[[Eyeless in Gaza (novel)|Eyeless in Gaza]]''). In ''Brave New World'', set in a [[dystopia]]n London, Huxley portrays a society operating on the principles of mass production and [[Classical conditioning|Pavlovian conditioning]]. Huxley was strongly influenced by [[F. Matthias Alexander]] and included him as a character in ''Eyeless in Gaza''.

Starting from this period, Huxley began to write and edit non-fiction works on pacifist issues, including ''[[Ends and Means]]'', ''An Encyclopedia of Pacifism'', and ''Pacifism and Philosophy'', and was an active member of the [[Peace Pledge Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/people/huxley.html |publisher=Peace Pledge Union |title=Aldous Huxley |accessdate=15 May 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110606072731/http://www.ppu.org.uk/people/huxley.html |archivedate= 6 June 2011 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In 1937, Huxley moved to Hollywood with his wife Maria, son [[Matthew Huxley]], and friend [[Gerald Heard]]. He lived in the US, mainly in southern California, until his death, but also for a time in [[Taos, New Mexico]], where he wrote ''[[Ends and Means]]'' (published in 1937). The book contains tracts on war, religion, nationalism and ethics.

Heard introduced Huxley to [[Vedanta]] ([[Upanishads|Upanishad-centered philosophy]]), meditation, and [[vegetarianism]] through the principle of [[ahimsa]]. In 1938, Huxley befriended [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], whose teachings he greatly admired. He also became a Vedantist in the circle of Hindu [[Swami Prabhavananda]], and introduced [[Christopher Isherwood]] to this circle. Not long after, Huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas, ''[[The Perennial Philosophy]]'', which discussed the teachings of renowned mystics of the world. Huxley's book affirmed a sensibility that insists there are realities beyond the generally accepted &quot;five senses&quot; and that there is genuine meaning for humans beyond both sensual satisfactions and sentimentalities.

Huxley became a close friend of Remsen Bird, president of [[Occidental College]]. He spent much time at the college, which is in the [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles|Eagle Rock]] neighbourhood of Los Angeles. The college appears as &quot;Tarzana College&quot; in his satirical novel ''[[After Many a Summer]]'' (1939). The novel won Huxley a British literary award, the 1939 [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Haugrud Reiff, Raychel (2003) ''Aldous Huxley: Brave New World'' p. 103. Marshall Cavendish, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley also incorporated Bird into the novel.

During this period, Huxley earned a substantial income as a Hollywood screenwriter; [[Christopher Isherwood]], in his autobiography ''My Guru and His Disciple'', states that Huxley earned more than $3,000 per week (an enormous sum in those days) as a screenwriter, and that he used much of it to transport Jewish and left-wing writer and artist refugees from Hitler's Germany to the U.S. In March 1938, his friend [[Anita Loos]], a novelist and screenwriter, put him in touch with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] who hired Huxley for ''[[Madame Curie (film)|Madame Curie]]'', which was originally to star [[Greta Garbo]] and be directed by [[George Cukor]]. (Eventually, the film was completed by MGM in 1943 with a different director and cast.) Huxley received screen credit for ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1940) and was paid for his work on a number of other films, including ''[[Jane Eyre (1943 film)|Jane Eyre]]'' (1944). Huxley was commissioned by Walt Disney in 1945 to write a script based on ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and the biography of the story's author, Lewis Carroll. The script was not used, however.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2010/04/15/mcsweeneys_intellectual_screenplays/ Salon]&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley wrote an introduction to the posthumous publication of [[J. D. Unwin]]'s 1940 book ''Hopousia or The Sexual and Economic Foundations of a New Society''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = JD | last = Unwin | title = Hopousia or The Sexual and Economic Foundations of a New Society | year = 1940 | publisher = Oscar Piest | place = NY}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 October 1949, Huxley wrote to [[George Orwell]], author of ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', congratulating him on &quot;how fine and how profoundly important the book is&quot;. In his letter to Orwell, he predicted:
{{Quote | Within the next generation I believe that the world's leaders will discover that infant conditioning and narco-hypnosis are more efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging them and kicking them into obedience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last = Huxley | first=Aldous |editor=Grover Smith |title=Letters of Aldous Huxley |year=1969 |publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus |location=London |isbn = 978-0-7011-1312-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Huxley had deeply felt apprehensions about the future the developed world might make for itself. From these, he made some warnings in his writings and talks. In a 1958 televised interview conducted by journalist [[Mike Wallace]], Huxley outlined several major concerns: the difficulties and dangers of world overpopulation; the tendency toward distinctly hierarchical social organisation; the crucial importance of evaluating the use of technology in mass societies susceptible to wily persuasion; the tendency to promote modern politicians to a naive public as well-marketed commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePNGa0m3XA |title=The Mike Wallace Interview: Aldous Huxley (18 May 1958) |publisher=YouTube |date=25 July 2011 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post World War II ===
In 1953, Huxley and Maria applied for [[Citizenship in the United States|United States citizenship]] and presented themselves for examination. When Huxley refused to bear arms for the US and would not state that his objections were based on religious ideals, the only excuse allowed under the [[McCarran Internal Security Act|McCarran Act]], the judge had to adjourn the proceedings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reiff2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Raychel Haugrud Reiff|title=Aldous Huxley: Brave New World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8JyRntokmqYC&amp;pg=PA31|date=1 September 2009|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-4701-6|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas Murray|title=Aldous Huxley: An English Intellectual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7h7CKgXGDi4C&amp;pg=PT309|date=4 June 2009|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|isbn=978-0-7481-1231-9|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; He withdrew his application. Nevertheless, he remained in the US. In 1959 Huxley turned down an offer of a [[Knight Bachelor]] by the [[Harold Macmillan#Prime Minister (1957–1963)|Macmillan government]] without putting forward a reason; his brother Julian had been knighted in 1958, while another brother Andrew would be knighted in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopaedia Britannica''. (2003). Volume 6. p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

== Association with Vedanta ==
Beginning in 1939 and continuing until his death in 1963, Huxley had an extensive association with the [[Vedanta Society of Southern California]], founded and headed by [[Swami Prabhavananda]]. Together with [[Gerald Heard]], [[Christopher Isherwood]], and other followers he was initiated by the Swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices.{{sfn|Roy|2003}}

In 1944, Huxley wrote the introduction to the &quot;Bhagavad Gita: The Song of God&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;IsherwoodSwami Prabhavananda1987&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Isherwood |first1=Christopher |last2=Swami Prabhavananda |last3=Aldous |first3=Huxley |title=Bhagavad Gita: The Song of God |year=1987 |publisher=Vedanta Press |location=Hollywood, Calif |isbn=978-0-87481-043-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; translated by Swami Prabhavananda and Christopher Isherwood, which was published by The Vedanta Society of Southern California.

From 1941 until 1960, Huxley contributed 48 articles to ''Vedanta and the West'', published by the society. He also served on the editorial board with Isherwood, Heard, and playwright John van Druten from 1951 through 1962.

Huxley also occasionally lectured at the Hollywood and Santa Barbara Vedanta temples. Two of those lectures have been released on CD: ''[[Knowledge and Understanding]]'' and ''[[Who Are We? (album)|Who Are We?]]'' from 1955. Nonetheless, Huxley's agnosticism, together with his speculative propensity, made it difficult for him to fully embrace any form of institutionalized religion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Weber]], &quot; [https://www.academia.edu/1564486/_Perennial_Truth_and_Perpetual_Perishing._A._Huxleys_Worldview_in_the_Light_of_A._N._Whiteheads_Process_Philosophy_of_Time_2007_ Perennial Truth and Perpetual Perishing. A. Huxley’s Worldview in the Light of A. N. Whitehead’s Process Philosophy of Time] &quot;, in Bernfried Nugel, Uwe Rasch and Gerhard Wagner (eds.), ''Aldous Huxley, Man of Letters: Thinker, Critic and Artist, Proceedings of the Third International Aldous Huxley Symposium Riga 2004'', Münster, LIT, “Human Potentialities”, Band 9, 2007, pp. 31–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1953, Huxley had his first experience with [[psychedelic drug]]s (in this case, [[mescaline]]). Huxley had initiated a correspondence with [[Humphry Osmond|Dr. Humphry Osmond]], a British psychiatrist then employed in a Canadian institution, and eventually asked him to supply a dose of mescaline; Osmond obliged and supervised Huxley’s session in southern California. After the publication of ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', in which he recounted this experience, Huxley and Swami Prabhavananda disagreed about the meaning and importance of the psychedelic drug experience, which may have caused the relationship to cool, but Huxley continued to write articles for the society's journal, lecture at the temple, and attend social functions.

== Eyesight ==
There are differing accounts about the details of the quality of Huxley's eyesight at specific points in his life. About 1939, Huxley encountered the [[Bates method]] for better eyesight, and a teacher, [[Margaret Darst Corbett]], who was able to teach the method to him. In 1940, Huxley relocated from Hollywood to a {{convert|40|acre|ha| adj =on}} ''ranchito'' in the high desert hamlet of [[Llano, California]], in northernmost Los Angeles County. Huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the Bates Method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern American desert. He reported that, for the first time in more than 25 years, he was able to read without glasses and without strain. He even tried driving a car along the dirt road beside the ranch. He wrote a book about his successes with the Bates Method, ''[[The Art of Seeing]]'', which was published in 1942 (U.S.), 1943 (UK). The book contained some generally disputed theories, and its publication created a growing degree of popular controversy about Huxley's eyesight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Aldous Huxley Annual|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYFcahCQm4wC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=The+Art+of+Seeing+huxley&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQ9K27y6zKAhUHKx4KHZ84DjAQuwUIVDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Art%20of%20Seeing%20huxley&amp;f=false|publisher = LIT Verlag Münster|date = 28 February 2011|isbn = 978-3-643-10450-2|language = en|first = Bernfried|last = Nugel|first2 = Jerome|last2 = Meckier|page = 111|chapter = A New Look at The Art of Seeing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was, and is, widely believed that Huxley was nearly blind since the illness in his teens, despite the partial recovery that had enabled him to study at Oxford. For example, some ten years after publication of ''The Art of Seeing'', in 1952, [[Bennett Cerf]] was present when Huxley spoke at a Hollywood banquet, wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty: &quot;Then suddenly he faltered — and the disturbing truth became obvious. He wasn't reading his address at all. He had learned it by heart. To refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes. When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn't read it, and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him. It was an agonising moment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardner&quot;&gt;Cerf, Bennett (12 April 1952), ''The Saturday Review'' (column), quoted in {{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Martin | authorlink =Martin Gardner |title=[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]] |year=1957 |publisher=Dover Publications |isbn = 978-0-486-20394-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazilian author [[João Ubaldo Ribeiro]], who as a young journalist spent several evenings in the Huxleys company in the late 1950's, wrote&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = O Conselheiro Come|publisher = Editora Nova Fronteira|date = 2000|isbn = 85-209-1069-6|language = pt|page = 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Huxley had said to him, with a wry smile: “I can hardly see at all. And I don't give a damn, really.” Ribeiro then proceeds to confirm [[Bennett Cerf]]'s experience, as described above.

On the other hand, Huxley's second wife, [[Laura Archera]], would later emphasise in her biographical account, ''This Timeless Moment'': &quot;One of the great achievements of his life: that of having regained his sight.&quot; After revealing a letter she wrote to the ''Los Angeles Times'' disclaiming the label of Huxley as a &quot;poor fellow who can hardly see&quot; by [[Walter C. Alvarez]], she tempered this: &quot;Although I feel it was an injustice to treat Aldous as though he were blind, it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision. For instance, although Aldous did not wear glasses, he would quite often use a magnifying lens.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Huxley&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Huxley |first=Laura |title=This Timeless Moment |year=1968 |publisher= Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-89087-968-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laura Huxley proceeded to elaborate a few nuances of inconsistency peculiar to Huxley's vision. Her account, in this respect, is discernibly congruent with the following sample of Huxley's own words from ''The Art of Seeing'': &quot;The most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism, or any part of the organism, is that it is not constant, but highly variable.&quot; Nevertheless, the topic of Huxley's eyesight continues to endure similar, significant controversy, regardless of how trivial a subject matter it might initially appear.&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe, Lionel (1981) ''Literary LA'' p. 50. Chronicle Books, 1981. University of California.&lt;/ref&gt;

American [[popular science]] author [[Steven Johnson (author)|Steven Johnson]], in his book ''Mind Wide Open'', quotes Huxley about his difficulties with [[Encoding (memory)#Visual encoding|visual encoding]]: &quot;I am and, for as long as I can remember, I have always been a poor visualizer. Words, even the pregnant words of poets, do not evoke pictures in my mind. No hypnagogic visions greet me on the verge of sleep. When I recall something, the memory does not present itself to me as a vividly seen event or object. By an effort of the will, I can evoke a not very vivid image of what happened yesterday afternoon&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, ''The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell'', Harper Perennial, 1963, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnson |first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Johnson (author) |title = Mind Wide Open: Your Brain and the Neuroscience of Everyday Life | location =New York |publisher=Scribner |year=2004 |page=235 |ISBN = 978-0-7432-4165-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Huxley married Maria Nys (10 September 1899 – 12 February 1955), a Belgian he met at [[Garsington]], Oxfordshire, in 1919. They had one child, [[Matthew Huxley]] (19 April 1920 – 10 February 2005), who had a career as an author, anthropologist, and prominent [[epidemiology|epidemiologist]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A31009-2005Feb16.html &quot;Author, NIMH Epidemiologist Matthew Huxley Dies at 84&quot;.] 17 February 2005 ''[[The Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, Maria died of cancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

In 1956, Huxley married [[Laura Huxley|Laura Archera]] (1911–2007), also an author as well as a violinist and psychotherapist.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; She wrote ''This Timeless Moment'', a biography of Huxley. Laura felt inspired to illuminate the story of their marriage through Mary Ann Braubach's 2010 documentary, &quot;Huxley on Huxley&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://huxleyonhuxley.com/about/synopsis/ |title=Huxley on Huxley. |others=Dir. Mary Ann Braubach. Cinedigm, 2010. DVD.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, Huxley was diagnosed with [[laryngeal cancer]] and, in the years that followed, with his health deteriorating, he wrote the Utopian novel ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bowering ''Aldous Huxley: A Study of the Major Novels'', p. 197, Oxford University Press, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; and gave lectures on &quot;Human Potentialities&quot; both at the [[University of California]]'s San Francisco Medical Center and at the [[Esalen Institute]]. These lectures were fundamental to the beginning of the [[Human Potential Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kripal |first=Jeffrey |title=Esalen America and the Religion of No Religion |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2007}}[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/453699.html excerpt].&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley was a close friend of [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] and [[Rosalind Rajagopal]] and was involved in the creation of the Happy Valley School (now [[Besant Hill School]] of Happy Valley) in [[Ojai, California]].

The most substantial collection of Huxley's few remaining papers (following the destruction of most in a fire) is at the Library of the University of California, Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt1489q14s/ |title=Finding Aid for the Aldous and Laura Huxley papers, 1925–2007 |publisher=Special Collections, [[Charles E.

On 9 April 1962, Huxley was informed he was elected Companion of Literature by the [[Royal Society of Literature]], the senior literary organisation in Britain, and he accepted the title via letter on 28 April 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;Society&quot;&gt;Peter Edgerly Firchow, Hermann Josef Real (2005). &quot;The Perennial Satirist: Essays in Honour of Bernfried Nugel, Presented on the Occasion of His 65th Birthday&quot;, p. 1.

Huxley wrote a draft of the speech he intended to give at the society; however, his deteriorating health meant he would not be able to attend.&lt;ref name=&quot;Society&quot; /&gt;

== Death ==
On his deathbed, unable to speak due to advanced [[laryngeal cancer]], Huxley made a written request to his wife Laura for &quot;LSD, 100 [[Microgram|µg]], [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscular]]&quot;. According to her account of his death&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/03/most-beautiful-death.html |title=Account of Huxley's death on Letters of Note |publisher=Lettersofnote.com |date=25 March 2010 |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''This Timeless Moment'', she obliged with an injection at 11:20&amp;nbsp;a.m. and a second dose an hour later; Huxley died aged 69, at 5:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. (Los Angeles time), on 22 November 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Raychel Haugrud Reiff (2009). &quot;Aldous Huxley: Brave New World&quot;. p. 35. Marshall Cavendish&lt;/ref&gt;

Media coverage of Huxley's death — as with that of the author [[C. S. Lewis]] – was overshadowed by the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy]] on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Ruddick (1993). &quot;Ultimate Island: On the Nature of British Science Fiction&quot;. p. 28. Greenwood Press&lt;/ref&gt; This coincidence served as the basis for [[Peter Kreeft]]'s book ''[[Between Heaven and Hell (novel)|Between Heaven and Hell: A Dialog Somewhere Beyond Death with John F. Kennedy, C. S. Lewis, &amp; Aldous Huxley]]'', which imagines a conversation among the three men taking place in Purgatory following their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kreeft|first1=Peter|title=Between Heaven and Hell: A Dialog Somewhere Beyond Death with John F.

How might the conversation go?&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley's memorial service took place in London in December 1963 which was led by his older brother [[Julian Huxley|Julian]], and on 27 October 1971&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Aldous Huxley:  A Biography| last = Murray| first = Nicholas| publisher = St. Martin's Press| date = 2003| isbn = 978-0312302375| page = 455| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tukmDMYu6ysC&amp;lpg=PA455&amp;ots=EvzavKTfre&amp;dq=(%22Aldous%20Huxley%22%7C%22Huxley%20Aldous%22)%20(%22funeral%22%7C%22burial%22%7C%22buried%22%7C%22interment%22%7C%22interred%22)%201971&amp;hl=fr&amp;pg=PA455#v=onepage&amp;q=%2227%20october%201971%22&amp;f=false| accessdate = 9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; his ashes were interred in the family grave at the Watts Cemetery, home of the [[Watts Mortuary Chapel]] in [[Compton, Guildford]], Surrey, England.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.

Huxley had been a long-time friend of Russian composer [[Igor Stravinsky]], who later dedicated his last orchestral composition to Huxley. Stravinsky began ''Variations'' in Santa Fé, New Mexico, in July 1963, and completed the composition in Hollywood on 28 October 1964. It was first performed in Chicago on 17 April 1965, by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra conducted by Robert Craft.&lt;ref&gt;Spies 1965, 62; White 1979, 534&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White 1979, 536–37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Relevance to Huxley? : Although not composed for the purpose, Stravinsky's music was twice choreographed for the New York City Ballet by George Balanchine, a first version in 1966, and a second version in 1982, both times under the title ''Variations'' (Barnes 1966; Anderson 1982). --&gt;
