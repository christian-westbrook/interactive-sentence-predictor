{{Neuron map|Axon}}

An '''axon''' (from Greek ἄξων ''áxōn'', axis), is a long, slender projection of a nerve cell, or [[neuron]], that typically conducts [[action potential|electrical impulses]] away from the neuron's [[cell body]]. Axons are also known as [[nerve fiber]]s. The function of the axon is to transmit information to different neurons, muscles and glands. In certain sensory neurons ([[pseudounipolar neuron]]s), such as those for touch and warmth, the electrical impulse travels along an axon from the periphery to the cell body, and from the cell body to the spinal cord along another branch of the same axon. Axon dysfunction has caused many inherited and acquired neurological disorders which can affect both the peripheral and central neurons. Nerve fibers are classed into three types – [[A delta fiber]]s, B fibers, and [[Group C nerve fiber|C fibres]]. A and B are [[myelin]]ated and C are unmyelinated.

An axon is one of two types of [[protoplasm]]ic protrusions from the cell body of a neuron; the other type is a [[dendrite]]. Axons are distinguished from dendrites by several features, including shape (dendrites often taper while axons usually maintain a constant radius), length (dendrites are restricted to a small region around the cell body while axons can be much longer), and function (dendrites receive signals whereas axons transmit them). All of these rules have exceptions, however.

Axons are covered by a membrane known as [[axolemma]]; the cytoplasm of axon is called [[axoplasm]].The branched end of an axon is formed by [[telodendron|telodendria]];  the swollen end of a telodendron is known as the [[axon terminal]]; which joins the dendron or cell body of another neurone forming a synaptic connection.

Some types of neurons have no axon and transmit signals from their dendrites. No neuron ever has more than one axon; however in invertebrates such as insects or leeches the axon sometimes consists of several regions that function more or less independently of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yau |first=KW |year=1976 |title=Receptive fields, geometry and conduction block of sensory neurons in the CNS of the leech |journal=[[Journal of Physiology|J. Physiol.]] |location=Lond |volume=263 |issue=3 |pages=513–538 |doi= 10.1113/jphysiol.1976.sp011643|pmid=1018277 |pmc=1307715}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most axons branch, in some cases very profusely.

Axons make contact with other cells—usually other neurons but sometimes muscle or gland cells—at junctions called [[synapse]]s.  At a synapse, the [[Cell membrane|membrane]] of the axon closely adjoins the membrane of the target cell, and special molecular structures serve to transmit electrical or electrochemical signals across the gap. Some synaptic junctions appear partway along an axon as it extends—these are called ''en passant'' (&quot;in passing&quot;) synapses. Other synapses appear as terminals at the ends of axonal branches. A single axon, with all its branches taken together, can [[innervate]] multiple parts of the brain and generate thousands of synaptic terminals.

Axons are the primary transmission lines of the [[nervous system]], and as bundles they form [[nerve]]s. Some axons can extend up to one meter or more while others extend as little as one millimeter. The longest axons in the human body are those of the [[sciatic nerve]], which run from the base of the [[spinal cord]] to the big toe of each foot. The diameter of axons is also variable. Most individual axons are microscopic in diameter (typically about one [[micrometre|micrometer]] (µm) across). The largest mammalian axons can reach a diameter of up to 20&amp;nbsp;µm. The squid giant axon, which is specialized to conduct signals very rapidly, is close to 1 [[millimetre]] in diameter, the size of a small pencil lead. Axonal arborization (the branching structure at the end of a nerve fiber) also differs from one nerve fiber to the next. Axons in the [[central nervous system]] typically show complex trees with many branch points. In comparison, the cerebellar granule cell axon is characterized by a single T-shaped branch node from which two parallel fibers extend. Elaborate arborization allows for the simultaneous transmission of messages to a large number of target neurons within a single region of the brain.

There are two types of axons occurring in the [[peripheral nervous system]] and the central nervous system: [[Myelin|unmyelinated]] and [[myelin]]ated axons.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21527732&quot; /&gt; [[Myelin]] is a layer of a fatty insulating substance, which is formed by two types of [[neuroglia|glial cells]]: [[Schwann cell]]s ensheathing [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] neurons and [[oligodendrocyte]]s insulating those of the [[central nervous system]]. Along myelinated nerve fibers, gaps in the myelin sheath known as [[myelin sheath gap|nodes of Ranvier]] occur at evenly spaced intervals. The myelination enables an especially rapid mode of electrical impulse propagation called [[saltatory conduction]]. Demyelination of axons causes the multitude of neurological symptoms found in the disease [[multiple sclerosis]].
[[File:Human brain right dissected lateral view description.JPG|thumb|left|A dissected human brain, showing [[grey matter]] and [[white matter]]]]
If the brain of a vertebrate is extracted and sliced into thin sections, some parts of each section appear dark and other parts lighter in color. The dark parts are known as [[grey matter]] and the lighter parts as [[white matter]]. White matter gets its light color from the myelin sheaths of axons:  the white matter parts of the brain are characterized by a high density of myelinated axons passing through them, and a low density of cell bodies of neurons. The [[cerebral cortex]] has a thick layer of grey matter on the surface and a large volume of white matter underneath:  what this means is that most of the surface is filled with neuron cell bodies, whereas much of the area underneath is filled with myelinated axons that connect these neurons to each other.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Initial segment===
The axon initial segment — the thick, unmyelinated part of an axon that connects directly to the cell body — consists of a specialized complex of proteins. It is approximately 25μm in length and  functions as the site of [[action potential]] initiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=BD|author2=Goldberg, EM |author3=Rudy, B |title=Electrogenic tuning of the axon initial segment.|journal=The Neuroscientist : a review journal bringing neurobiology, neurology and psychiatry|date=Dec 2009|volume=15|issue=6|pages=651–68|pmid=20007821|doi=10.1177/1073858409341973|pmc=2951114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The density of voltage-gated [[sodium channel]]s is much higher in the initial segment than in the remainder of the axon or in the adjacent cell body, excepting the [[axon hillock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wollner|first=DA|author2=Catterall, WA|title=Localization of sodium channels in axon hillocks and initial segments of retinal ganglion cells.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Nov 1986|volume=83|issue=21|pages=8424–8|pmid=2430289|doi=10.1073/pnas.83.21.8424|pmc=386941}}&lt;/ref&gt; The voltage-gated ion channels are known to be found within certain areas of the axonal membrane and initiate action potential, conduction, and synaptic transmission.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21527732&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Debanne|first1= Dominique|last2= Campanac|first2= Emilie|last3= Bialowas|first3= Andrzej|last4= Carlier|first4= Edmond|last5= Alcaraz|first5= Gisèle|title=Axon physiology.|journal=Physiological reviews|date=Apr 2011|volume=91|issue=2|pages=555–602|doi=10.1152/physrev.00048.2009|pmid=21527732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nodes of Ranvier===
{{Main article|Myelin sheath gap}}
[[Node of Ranvier|Nodes of Ranvier]] (also known as ''myelin sheath gaps'') are short unmyelinated segments of a [[myelin|myelinated axon]], which are found periodically interspersed between segments of the myelin sheath. Therefore, at the point of the node of Ranvier, the axon is reduced in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hess|first=A|author2=Young, JZ|title=The nodes of Ranvier|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society|date=November 20, 1952|volume=140|series=Series B|issue=900|pages=301–320|jstor=82721 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1952.0063|pmid=13003931}}&lt;/ref&gt; These nodes are areas where action potentials can be generated. In [[saltatory conduction]], electrical currents produced at each node of Ranvier are conducted with little attenuation to the next node in line, where they remain strong enough to generate another action potential. Thus in a myelinated axon, action potentials effectively &quot;jump&quot; from node to node, bypassing the myelinated stretches in between, resulting in a propagation speed much faster than even the fastest unmyelinated axon can sustain.

==Action potentials==
{{Synapse map}}
Most axons carry signals in the form of [[action potential]]s, which are discrete electrochemical impulses that travel rapidly along an axon, starting at the cell body and terminating at points where the axon makes [[chemical synapse|synaptic]] contact with target cells.  The defining characteristic of an action potential is that it is &quot;all-or-nothing&quot; — every action potential that an axon generates has essentially the same size and shape. This all-or-nothing characteristic allows action potentials to be transmitted from one end of a long axon to the other without any reduction in size.  There are, however, some types of neurons with short axons that carry graded electrochemical signals, of variable amplitude.

When an action potential reaches a presynaptic terminal, it activates the synaptic transmission process. The first step is rapid opening of calcium ion channels in the membrane of the axon, allowing calcium ions to flow inward across the membrane. The resulting increase in intracellular calcium concentration causes [[synaptic vesicle|vesicle]]s (tiny containers enclosed by a lipid membrane) filled with a [[neurotransmitter]] chemical to fuse with the axon's membrane and empty their contents into the extracellular space. The neurotransmitter is released from the presynaptic nerve through [[exocytosis]]. The neurotransmitter chemical then diffuses across to receptors located on the membrane of the target cell. The neurotransmitter binds to these receptors and activates them. Depending on the type of receptors that are activated, the effect on the target cell can be to excite the target cell, inhibit it, or alter its metabolism in some way. This entire sequence of events often takes place in less than a thousandth of a second. Afterward, inside the presynaptic terminal, a new set of vesicles is moved into position next to the membrane, ready to be released when the next action potential arrives. The action potential is the final electrical step in the integration of synaptic messages at the scale of the neuron.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21527732&quot; /&gt;

(B) overlay of the three average waveforms; (C) average and standard error of peak-trough time for pyramidal cells interneurons, and putative axons.(D)Scatter plot of signal to noise ratios for individual units againstpeak-trough time for axons, pyramidal cells (PYR) and interneurons (INT).]]

Extracellular recordings of [[action potential]] propagation in axons has been demonstrated in freely moving animals. While extracellular somatic action potentials have been used to study cellular activity in freely moving animals such as [[place cells]], axonal activity in both [[White matter|white]] and [[gray matter]] can also be recorded. Extracellular recordings of axon action potential propagation is distinct from somatic action potentials in three ways: 1. The signal has a shorter peak-trough duration (~150μs) than of pyramidal cells (~500μs) or interneurons (~250μs). 2. The voltage change is triphasic. 3. Activity recorded on a tetrode is seen on only one of the four recording wires. In recordings from freely moving rats, axonal signals have been isolated in white matter tracts including the alveus and the corpus callosum as well hippocampal gray matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robbins|first=A|author2=Fox, S|title=Short Duration Waveforms Recorded Extracellularly from Freely Moving Rats are Representative of Axonal Activity|journal=Frontiers in Neural Circuits|date=Nov 2013|volume=7|issue=181|pages=7–11|doi=10.3389/fncir.2013.00181|pmid=24348338|pmc=3831546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, the generation of [[action potential]]s in vivo is sequential in nature, and these sequential spikes constitute the digital codes in the [[neuron]]s. Although previous studies indicate an axonal origin of a single spike evoked by short-term pulses, physiological signals in vivo trigger the initiation of sequential spikes at the cell bodies of the neurons.&lt;ref Physiological synaptic signals initiate sequential spikes at soma of cortical pyramidal neurons&gt;Rongjing Ge, Hao Qian and Jin-Hui Wang* (2011) Molecular Brain 4(19), 1~11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Input-dependent subcellular localization of spike initiation between soma and axon at cortical pyramidal neurons&gt;Rongjing Ge, Hao Qian, Na Chen and Jin-Hui Wang* (2014) Molecular Brain 7(26):1-16&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to propagating action potentials to axonal terminals, the axon is able to amplify the action potentials, which makes sure a secure propagation of sequential action potentials toward the axonal terminal. In terms of molecular mechanisms, [[voltage-gated sodium channel]]s in the axons possess lower [[Threshold potential|threshold]] and shorter [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]] in response to short-term pulses.&lt;ref Axon amplifies somatic incomplete spikes to uniform&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = Na | last2 = Yu | first2 = Jiandong | last3 = Qian | first3 = Hao | last4 = Jin-Hui | year = 2010 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0011868 | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 5 | issue = 7| page = e11868 | title=Axons Amplify Somatic Incomplete Spikes into Uniform Amplitudes in Mouse Cortical Pyramidal Neurons| doi-access = free | pmid=20686619 | pmc=2912328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and growth==

===Development===
Studies done on cultured [[hippocampus|hippocampal]] neurons suggest that neurons initially produce multiple [[neurite]]s that are equivalent, yet only one of these neurites is destined to become the axon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fletcher|first=TL|author2=Banker, GA|title=The establishment of polarity by hippocampal neurons: the relationship between the stage of a cell's development in situ and its subsequent development in culture.|journal=Developmental Biology|date=Dec 1989|volume=136|issue=2|pages=446–54|doi=10.1016/0012-1606(89)90269-8|pmid=2583372}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether axon specification precedes axon elongation or vice versa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jiang|first=H|author2=Rao, Y|title=Axon formation: fate versus growth.|journal=Nature Neuroscience|date=May 2005|volume=8|issue=5|pages=544–6|doi=10.1038/nn0505-544|pmid=15856056}}&lt;/ref&gt; although recent evidence points to the latter. If an axon that is not fully developed is cut, the polarity can change and other neurites can potentially become the axon. This alteration of polarity only occurs when the axon is cut at least 10 μm shorter than the other neurites. After the incision is made, the longest neurite will become the future axon and all the other neurites, including the original axon, will turn into dendrites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goslin|first=K|author2=Banker, G|title=Experimental observations on the development of polarity by hippocampal neurons in culture.|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|date=Apr 1989|volume=108|issue=4|pages=1507–16|doi=10.1083/jcb.108.4.1507|pmid=2925793|pmc=2115496}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imposing an external force on a neurite, causing it to elongate, will make it become an axon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lamoureux|first=P|author2=Ruthel, G |author3=Buxbaum, RE |author4= Heidemann, SR |title=Mechanical tension can specify axonal fate in hippocampal neurons.|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|date=Nov 11, 2002|volume=159|issue=3|pages=499–508|doi=10.1083/jcb.200207174|pmid=12417580|pmc=2173080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, axonal development is achieved through a complex interplay between extracellular signaling, intracellular signaling and [[cytoskeleton|cytoskeletal]] dynamics.

====Extracellular signaling====
The extracellular signals that propagate through the [[extracellular matrix]] surrounding neurons play a prominent role in axonal development.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17311006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arimura|first=N|author2=Kaibuchi, K|title=Neuronal polarity: from extracellular signals to intracellular mechanisms.|journal=Nature Reviews. Neuroscience|date=Mar 2007|volume=8|issue=3|pages=194–205|doi=10.1038/nrn2056|pmid=17311006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These signaling molecules include proteins, [[neurotrophic factors]], and extracellular matrix and adhesion molecules.
UNC-6 or [[netrin]], a secreted protein, functions in axon formation. When the UNC-6 receptor is mutated, several neurites are irregularly projected out of neurons and finally a single axon is extended anteriorly.&lt;ref name=&quot;A&quot;&gt;[[Neuroglia]] and [[pioneer neuron]]s express UNC-6 to provide global and local netrin cues for guiding migrations in [[Caenorhabditis elegans|''C. elegans'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Serafini|first=T|author2=Kennedy, TE |author3=Galko, MJ |author4=Mirzayan, C |author5=Jessell, TM |author6= Tessier-Lavigne, M |title=The netrins define a family of axon outgrowth-promoting proteins homologous to C. elegans UNC-6.|journal=Cell|date=Aug 12, 1994|volume=78|issue=3|pages=409–24|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(94)90420-0|pmid=8062384}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hong|first=K|author2=Hinck, L |author3=Nishiyama, M |author4=Poo, MM |author5=Tessier-Lavigne, M |author6= Stein, E |title=A ligand-gated association between cytoplasmic domains of UNC5 and DCC family receptors converts netrin-induced growth cone attraction to repulsion.|journal=Cell|date=Jun 25, 1999|volume=97|issue=7|pages=927–41|doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80804-1|pmid=10399920}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hedgecock|first=EM|author2=Culotti, JG |author3=Hall, DH |title=The unc-5, unc-6, and unc-40 genes guide circumferential migrations of pioneer axons and mesodermal cells on the epidermis in C. elegans.|journal=Neuron|date=Jan 1990|volume=4|issue=1|pages=61–85|doi=10.1016/0896-6273(90)90444-K|pmid=2310575}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neurotrophic factors [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF), [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor]] (BDNF) and [[neurotrophin 3]] (NT3) are also involved in axon development and bind to [[Trk receptor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huang|first=EJ|author2=Reichardt, LF|title=Trk receptors: roles in neuronal signal transduction.|journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry|year=2003|volume=72|pages=609–42|doi=10.1146/annurev.biochem.72.121801.161629|pmid=12676795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ganglioside]]-converting enzyme plasma membrane ganglioside [[sialidase]] (PMGS), which is involved in the activation of [[TrkA]] at the tip of neutrites, is required for the elongation of axons. PMGS asymmetrically distributes to the tip of the neurite that is destined to become the future axon.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15834419&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Da Silva|first=JS|author2=Hasegawa, T |author3=Miyagi, T |author4=Dotti, CG |author5= Abad-Rodriguez, J |title=Asymmetric membrane ganglioside sialidase activity specifies axonal fate.|journal=Nature Neuroscience|date=May 2005|volume=8|issue=5|pages=606–15|doi=10.1038/nn1442|pmid=15834419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intracellular signaling====
During axonal development, the activity of [[PI3K]] is increased at the tip of destined axon. Disrupting the activity of PI3K inhibits axonal development. Activation of PI3K results in the production of [[phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate]] (PtdIns) which can cause significant elongation of a neurite, converting it into an axon. As such, the overexpression of [[phosphatase]]s that dephosphorylate PtdIns leads into the failure of polarization.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17311006&quot; /&gt;

====Cytoskeletal dynamics====
The neurite with the lowest [[actin]] filament content will become the axon. PGMS concentration and f-actin content are inversely correlated; when PGMS becomes enriched at the tip of a neurite, its f-actin content is substantially decreased.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15834419&quot; /&gt; In addition, exposure to actin-depolimerizing drugs and toxin B (which inactivates [[Rho family of GTPases|Rho-signaling]]) causes the formation of multiple axons. Consequently, the interruption of the actin network in a growth cone will promote its neurite to become the axon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bradke|first=F|author2=Dotti, CG|title=The role of local actin instability in axon formation.|journal=Science|date=Mar 19, 1999|volume=283|issue=5409|pages=1931–4|doi=10.1126/science.283.5409.1931|pmid=10082468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth===
[[Image:Axon two photon.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Axon of 9 day old mouse with growth cone visible]]
Growing axons move through their environment via the [[growth cone]], which is at the tip of the axon. The growth cone has a broad sheet like extension called [[lamellipodia]] which contain protrusions called [[filopodia]]. The filopodia are the mechanism by which the entire process adheres to surfaces and explores the surrounding environment. [[Actin]] plays a major role in the mobility of this system.
Environments with high levels of [[cell adhesion molecule]]s (CAMs) create an ideal environment for axonal growth. This seems to provide a &quot;sticky&quot; surface for axons to grow along. Examples of CAM's specific to neural systems include [[Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule|N-CAM]], neuroglial CAM or [[NgCAM]], [[TAG-1]], and [[MAG (neural)|MAG]] all of which are part of the [[immunoglobulin]] superfamily. Another set of molecules called [[extracellular matrix adhesion molecule]]s also provide a sticky substrate for axons to grow along. Examples of these molecules include [[laminin]], [[fibronectin]], [[tenascin]], and [[perlecan]]. Some of these are surface bound to cells and thus act as short range attractants or repellents. Others are difusible ligands and thus can have long range effects.

Cells called [[guidepost cells]] assist in the guidance of neuronal axon growth. These cells are typically other, sometimes immature, neurons.

It has also been discovered through research that if the axons of a neuron were damaged, as long as the soma (the cell body of a [[neuron]]) is not damaged, the axons would regenerate and remake the synaptic connections with neurons with the help of [[guidepost cells]]. This is also referred to as [[neuroregeneration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kunik |first=D |title=Laser-based single-axon transection for high-content axon injury and regeneration studies |journal=PLoS ONE |year=2011 |volume=6 |issue=11 |pages=e26832 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0026832 |pmid=22073205 |pmc=3206876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nogo-A is a type of neurite growth inhibitory component that is present in the central nervous system myelin membranes (found in an axon). It has a crucial role in restricting axonal regeneration in adult mammalian central nervous system. In recent studies, if Nogo- A is blocked and neutralized, it is possible to induce long-distance axonal regeneration which leads to enhancement of functional recovery in rats and mouse spinal cord. This has yet to be done on humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schwab |first=Martin E. |title=Nogo and axon regeneration |journal=[[Current Opinion in Neurobiology]] |year=2004 |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=118–124 |doi=10.1016/j.conb.2004.01.004 |pmid=15018947 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study has also found that [[macrophage]]s activated through a specific inflammatory pathway activated by the Dectin-1 receptor are capable of promoting axon recovery, also however causing neurotoxicity in the neuron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gensel |title=Macrophages promote axon regeneration with concurrent neurotoxicity |journal=[[Journal of Neuroscience]] |year=2009 |volume=29 |issue=12 |pages=3956–3968 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3992-08.2009 |pmc=2693768 |pmid=19321792 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
German anatomist [[Otto Friedrich Karl Deiters]] is generally credited with the discovery of the axon by distinguishing it from the dendrites.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21527732&quot; /&gt; Swiss [[Albert von Kölliker|Rüdolf Albert von Kölliker]] and German [[Robert Remak]] were the first to identify and characterize the axon initial segment. Kölliker named the axon in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/27151391|title=Origins of neuroscience : a history of explorations into brain function|last=Finger|first=Stanley|date=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1994|isbn=9780195146943|location=|pages=47|oclc=27151391|quote=Kölliker would give the &quot;axon&quot; its name in 1896.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Huxley]] also employed the [[squid giant axon]] (1939) and by 1952 they had obtained a full quantitative description of the ionic basis of the [[action potential]], leading to the formulation of the [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]]. Hodgkin and Huxley were awarded jointly the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] for this work in 1963. The formulas detailing axonal conductance were extended to vertebrates in the Frankenhaeuser–Huxley equations. [[Louis-Antoine Ranvier]] was the first to describe the gaps or nodes found on axons and for this contribution these axonal features are now commonly referred to as the [[Node of Ranvier|nodes of Ranvier]]. Santiago Ramón y Cajal, a Spanish anatomist, proposed that axons were the output components of neurons, describing their functionality.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21527732&quot; /&gt; Erlanger and Gasser earlier developed the classification system for peripheral nerve fibers,&lt;ref&gt;Sansom B, &quot;Reflex  Isolation&quot; http://www.sansomnia.com&lt;/ref&gt; based on axonal conduction velocity, [[myelin]]ation, fiber size etc.
Even recently our understanding of the biochemical basis for action potential propagation has advanced, and now includes many details about individual [[ion channel]]s.

The [[longfin inshore squid]] has been used as a [[model organism]] – it has the longest known axon.

==Injury==
{{Main article|Nerve injury}}
In order of degree of severity, injury to a nerve can be described as [[neurapraxia]], [[axonotmesis]], or [[neurotmesis]].
[[Concussion]] is considered a mild form of [[diffuse axonal injury]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emedicine.com/pmr/topic212.htm eMedicine - Traumatic Brain Injury: Definition, Epidemiology, Pathophysiology : Article by Segun T Dawodu, MD, FAAPMR, FAANEM, CIME, DipMI(RCSed)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The dysfunction of axons in the nervous system is one of the major causes of many inherited neurological disorders that affect both peripheral and central neurons.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21527732&quot; /&gt;

==Classification==

The axons that make up nerves in the human [[peripheral nervous system]] can be classified based on their physical features and signal conduction properties.

===Motor=== &lt;!-- Motor fiber types redirects here--&gt;
[[Lower motor neurons]] have two kind of fibers:

|}

===Sensory=== &lt;!--Sensory fiber types redirects here--&gt;
Different [[sensory receptors]] innervate different types of nerve fibers. [[Proprioceptor]]s are innervated by type Ia, Ib and II sensory fibers, [[mechanoreceptor]]s by type II and III sensory fibers and [[nociceptor]]s and [[thermoreceptors]] by type III and IV sensory fibers.
