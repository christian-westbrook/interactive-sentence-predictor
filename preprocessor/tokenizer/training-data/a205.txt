Physics.nist.gov. Retrieved on 2010-09-28.&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after [[André-Marie Ampère]] (1775–1836), French mathematician and physicist, considered the father of [[electrodynamics]].

SI defines the ampere in terms of other base units by measuring the electromagnetic force between electrical conductors carrying electric current. The earlier [[Centimetre gram second system of units#Derivation of CGS units in electromagnetism|CGS measurement system]] had two different definitions of current, one essentially the same as the SI's and the other using [[electric charge]] as the base unit, with the unit of charge defined by measuring the force between two charged metal plates. The ampere was then defined as one [[coulomb]] of charge per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = David Bodanis| last = Bodanis | first = David | year = 2005 | title = Electric Universe | place = New York | publisher = Three Rivers Press | ISBN = 978-0-307-33598-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In SI, the unit of charge, the coulomb, is defined as the charge carried by one ampere during one second.

In the future, the SI definition may shift back to charge as the base unit, with the coulomb defined in terms of the [[elementary charge]] on electrons and protons (one coulomb equals the charge of roughly {{val|6.242|e=18}} protons).

==Definition==
[[File:Ampere-def-en.svg|thumb|Illustration of the definition of the ampere unit]]
SI defines ampere as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ampere is that constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and placed one [[metre]] apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to {{val|2|e=-7}} [[newton (unit)|newtons]] per metre of length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/ampere.html|title=BIPM - ampere|website=www.bipm.org|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;BIPMdefinition&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Paul MS | last = Monk | title = Physical Chemistry: Understanding our Chemical World | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | year = 2004 | ISBN = 0-471-49180-2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0471491802&amp;id=LupAi35QjhoC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;ots=IMiGyIL-67&amp;dq=ampere+definition+si&amp;sig=9Y0k0wgvymmLNYFMcXodwJZwvAM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This force is used in the formal definition of the ampere.

The SI unit of charge, the [[coulomb]], &quot;is the quantity of electricity carried in 1 second by a current of 1 ampere&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = [[Bureau International des Poids et Mesures]] | year = 2006 | url = http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf | title = The International System of Units (SI) | edition = 8th | page = 144 | format = PDF}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a current of one ampere is one coulomb of charge going past a given point per second:
:&lt;math&gt;\rm 1\ A=1\tfrac C s.&lt;/math&gt;
In general, charge ''Q'' is determined by steady current ''I'' flowing for a time ''t'' as {{nowrap|1=''Q'' = ''It''}}.

Constant, instantaneous and average current are expressed in amperes (as in &quot;the charging current is 1.2&amp;nbsp;A&quot;) and the charge accumulated, or passed through a circuit over a period of time is expressed in coulombs (as in &quot;the [[battery (electricity)|battery]] charge is {{val|30000|u=C}}&quot;). The relation of the ampere (C/s) to the coulomb is the same as that of the [[watt]] (J/s) to the [[joule]].

== History ==
{{main|International System of Electrical and Magnetic Units}}
The ampere was originally defined as one tenth of the unit of [[electric current]] in the [[centimetre–gram–second system of units]]. That unit, now known as the [[abampere]], was defined as the amount of current that generates a force of two [[dyne]]s per centimetre of length between two wires one centimetre apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://alpha.montclair.edu/~kowalskiL/SI/SI_PAGE.HTML |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020214114359/http://alpha.montclair.edu/~kowalskiL/SI/SI_page.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 February 2002 |title=A short history of the SI units in electricity |publisher=Montclair |last=Kowalski |first=L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the unit was chosen so that the units derived from it in the [[MKS system of units|MKSA]] system would be conveniently sized.

The &quot;international ampere&quot; was an early realization of the ampere, defined as the current that would deposit {{val|0.001118|u=grams}} of silver per second from a [[silver nitrate]] solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.sizes.com/units/ampHist.htm |title=History of the ampere |publisher=Sizes |date=1 April 2014 |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, more accurate measurements revealed that this current is {{val|0.99985|u=A}}.

== Realization ==
The standard ampere is most accurately realized using a [[watt balance]], but is in practice maintained via [[Ohm's law]] from the units of [[electromotive force]] and [[electrical resistance|resistance]], the [[volt]] and the [[ohm]], since the latter two can be tied to physical phenomena that are relatively easy to reproduce, the [[Josephson junction]] and the [[quantum Hall effect]], respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Electrical quantities&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/appendix2/electrical.html |title=SI brochure |chapter=Appendix 2: Practical realization of unit definitions: Electrical quantities |publisher=BIPM|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414093725/http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/appendix2/electrical.html|archivedate=April 14, 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, techniques to establish the realization of an ampere have a [[relative uncertainty]] of approximately a few parts in 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, and involve realizations of the watt, the ohm and the volt.&lt;ref name= &quot;Electrical quantities&quot; /&gt;

== Proposed future definition ==
{{Main article|New SI definitions|CODATA 2018}}
Rather than a definition in terms of the force between two current-carrying wires, it has been proposed that the ampere should be defined in terms of the rate of flow of elementary charges.&lt;ref name = &quot;Beyond&quot; /&gt; Since a [[coulomb]] is approximately equal to {{val|6.2415093|e=18}} [[elementary charge]]s (such as those carried by [[proton]]s, or the negative of those carried by [[electron]]s), one ampere is approximately equivalent to {{val|6.2415093|e=18}} elementary charges moving past a boundary in one second. ({{val|6.2415093|e=18}} is the reciprocal of the value of the elementary charge in coulombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?e | publisher = NIST | place = USA | title = Physics | contribution = Value}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) The proposed change would define 1&amp;nbsp;A as being the current in the direction of flow of a particular number of elementary charges per second. In 2005, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) agreed to study the proposed change. The [[New SI definitions|new definition]] was discussed at the 25th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) in 2014 but for the time being was not adopted.

== Everyday examples ==
{{main article|Orders of magnitude (current)}}
The current drawn by typical constant-voltage energy distribution systems is usually dictated by the power ([[watt]]) consumed by the system and the operating voltage. For this reason the examples given below are grouped by voltage level.

=== CPUs – 1 V DC  ===
*Current Notebook CPUs (up to 15...45 W at 1 V): up to 15...45&amp;nbsp;A
*Current High End CPUs (up to 65...140 W at 1,15 V): up to 55...120&amp;nbsp;A

=== Portable devices ===
*Hearing aid (typically 1&amp;nbsp;mW at 1.4&amp;nbsp;V): 700&amp;nbsp;µA
*USB charging adapter (as power supply - typically 10&amp;nbsp;W at 5&amp;nbsp;V): 2&amp;nbsp;A

=== Internal combustion engine vehicles – 12 V DC ===
A typical motor vehicle has a 12&amp;nbsp;V battery. The various accessories that are powered by the battery might include:
*Instrument panel light (typically 2&amp;nbsp;W): 166&amp;nbsp;mA
*Headlight (each, typically 60&amp;nbsp;W): 5&amp;nbsp;A
*Starter motor (typically 1–2&amp;nbsp;kW): 80–160&amp;nbsp;A

=== North American domestic supply – 120 V AC ===
Most Canada, Mexico and United States domestic power suppliers run at 120&amp;nbsp;V.

Household [[circuit breaker]]s typically provide a maximum of 15&amp;nbsp;A or 20&amp;nbsp;A of current to a given set of outlets.
*22-inch/56-centimeter portable television (35&amp;nbsp;W): 290&amp;nbsp;mA
*Tungsten light bulb (60–100&amp;nbsp;W): 500–830&amp;nbsp;mA
*Toaster, kettle (1.5&amp;nbsp;kW): 12.5&amp;nbsp;A
*Hair dryer (1.8&amp;nbsp;kW): 15&amp;nbsp;A
*USB charging adapter (as load - typically 10&amp;nbsp;W): 83&amp;nbsp;mA

=== European &amp; Commonwealth domestic supply – 230–240 V AC ===
Most European domestic power supplies run at 230&amp;nbsp;V, and most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] domestic power supplies run at 240&amp;nbsp;V. For the same amount of power (in watts), the current drawn by a particular European or Commonwealth appliance (in Europe or a Commonwealth country) will be less than for an equivalent North American appliance.&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;The formula for power is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
P(t) = I(t) \cdot V(t) \,
&lt;/math&gt;
so it follows that if the voltage is doubled and the power remains the same, the current will be halved.&lt;/ref&gt; Typical circuit breakers will provide 16&amp;nbsp;A.

The current drawn by a number of typical appliances are:
*22-inch/56-centimeter portable television (35&amp;nbsp;W): 145–150&amp;nbsp;mA
*Tungsten light bulb (60–100&amp;nbsp;W): 240–450&amp;nbsp;mA
*Compact fluorescent lamp (11–30&amp;nbsp;W): 56–112&amp;nbsp;mA
*Toaster, kettle (2&amp;nbsp;kW): 9&amp;nbsp;A
*Immersion heater (4.6&amp;nbsp;kW): 19–20&amp;nbsp;A
