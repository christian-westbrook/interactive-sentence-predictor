'''Alexander I of [[Epirotes|Epirus]]''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀλέξανδρος Α' τῆς Ἠπείρου}}, 370&amp;nbsp;BC – 331&amp;nbsp;BC), also known as '''Alexander [[Molossians|Molossus]]''' ({{lang|grc|Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ Μολοσσός}}), was a king of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] (350–331&amp;nbsp;BC) of the [[Aeacides of Epirus|Aeacid dynasty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Mason | first = Charles Peter | authorlink = | title = Alexander | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 1 | pages = 116 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;idno=acl3129.0001.001;size=l;frm=frameset;seq=131;page=root;view=image}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the son of [[Neoptolemus I of Epirus|Neoptolemus I]] and brother of [[Olympias]], Alexander I was an uncle of [[Alexander the Great]]. He was also an uncle of [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]]. He was brought at an early age to the court of [[Philip II of Macedon]], and after the Hellenic fashion became the object of his attachment. At the age of about 20, Philip made him king of Epirus, after dethroning his uncle [[Arybbas of Epirus|Arybbas]].&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Junianus Justinus (Justin): Epitome of the Philippic History of Pompeius Trogus Book VIII, Chapter 6. Online translation http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/english/trans8.html&lt;/ref&gt;

When Olympias was repudiated by her husband, 337 BC, she went to her brother, and endeavoured to induce him to make war on Philip.

Alexander, however, declined the contest, and formed a second alliance with Philip by taking to wife the daughter of Philip (Alexander's niece) [[Cleopatra of Macedonia|Cleopatra]] in marriage (336&amp;nbsp;BC). At the wedding Philip was assassinated by [[Pausanias of Orestis]].

In 334&amp;nbsp;BC, Alexander I, at the request of the Greek colony of [[Taranto|Taras]] (in [[Magna Graecia]]), crossed over into [[Italy]], to aid them in battle against several [[Ancient Italic peoples|Italic tribes]], the [[Lucanians]] and [[Bruttii]]. After a victory over the [[Samnium|Samnites]] and Lucanians near [[Paestum]], 332&amp;nbsp;BC, he made a treaty with the [[Roman Republic|Romans]]. Success still followed his arms. He took [[Heraclea (Lucania)|Heraclea]] from the Lucanians, and [[Terina (ancient city)|Terina]] and [[Siponto|Sipontum]] from the Bruttii. Through the treachery of some Lucanian exiles, he was compelled to engage under unfavourable circumstances in the [[battle of Pandosia]] and was killed by a Lucanian. He left a son, [[Neoptolemus II of Epirus|Neoptolemus]], and a daughter, Cadmea.&lt;ref&gt;[[Junianus Justinus|Justin]]. ''Epitome of Pompeius Trogus'', viii.6, ix.6, xii.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]]. ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', viii.3, 17, 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Aulus Gellius]]. ''Noctes Atticae'', xvii.21&lt;/ref&gt;

In a famous passage&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0026%3Abook%3D9%3Achapter%3D19 Livy 9.19, Alternative history: Alexander the Great vs. Rome]&lt;/ref&gt; that is often considered the first specimen of [[Counterfactual history|alternative history]], [[Livy]] speculates on what would have been the outcome of a military showdown between [[Alexander the Great]] and the [[Roman Republic]]. He reports there that as Alexander of Epirus lay mortally wounded on the battlefield at Pandosia he compared his fortunes to those of his famous nephew and said that the latter &quot;waged war against women&quot;.
