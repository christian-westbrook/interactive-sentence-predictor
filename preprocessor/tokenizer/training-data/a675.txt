'''Aachen''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʔaːxn̩|-|De-Aachen-2.ogg}}) or '''Bad Aachen''', French and traditional English: '''Aix-la-Chapelle''' ({{IPA-fr|ɛks.lɑ.ʃɑ.pɛl}}), is a [[spa town|spa]] and [[border city]]&lt;ref name=&quot;young&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Young|Stetler|1987|p=272}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]]. Aachen developed from a [[Roman Republic|Roman]] settlement and spa, subsequently becoming the preferred medieval Imperial residence of [[Charlemagne]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicgermany.travel/historic-cities/aachen|title=Aachen  {{!}} Historic Highlights of Germany|last=Mueller|first=Joerg|date=2017-07-26|website=www.historicgermany.travel|language=DE|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, from 936 to 1531, the place where 31 [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperors]] were crowned [[List of German monarchs|Kings of the Germans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;munro&quot; /&gt;

Aachen is the westernmost city in Germany, located near the borders with [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], {{convert|61|km|abbr=on}} west south west of [[Cologne]]&lt;ref name=&quot;CVDE&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bridgwater|Aldrich|1968|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EA&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bayer|2000|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in a former coal-mining area.&lt;ref name=&quot;EA&quot; /&gt; One of Germany's leading institutes of higher education in technology, the [[RWTH Aachen University]] is located in the city.{{efn|&quot;RWTH&quot; is the abbreviation of &quot;Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule&quot;, which translates into &quot;Rhine-Westphalian Technical University&quot;. The institution is commonly referred to as &quot;RWTH Aachen&quot; or simply &quot;RWTH&quot;, with the abbreviation remaining untranslated in other languages to avoid the use of the &quot;Hochschule&quot; term, which is sometimes mistakenly translated as [[High school (disambiguation)|high school]]. Sometimes, RWTH Aachen is also referred to as &quot;TH Aachen&quot; or &quot;Aachen University&quot;. However, the term &quot;FH Aachen&quot; does not refer to the RWTH but to the [[Fachhochschule Aachen]], a [[Fachhochschule|university of applied sciences]], which is also in Aachen.}}&lt;ref name=&quot;rwth-aachen.de&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|RWTH Aachen University|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Aachen's industries include science, engineering and information technology. In 2009, Aachen was ranked eighth among cities in Germany for innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
The name &quot;Aachen&quot; is a modern descendant, like southern [[German language|German]] ''Ach(e)'', ''Aach'', meaning &quot;river&quot; or &quot;stream&quot;, from [[Old High German]] ''ahha'', meaning &quot;water&quot; or &quot;stream&quot;, which directly translates (and etymologically corresponds to) [[Latin]] ''Aquae'', referring to the springs. The location has been inhabited by humans since the [[Neolithic]] era, about 5,000 years ago, attracted to its warm [[mineral spring]]s. Latin ''Aquae'' figures in Aachen's [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] name ''Aquae granni'', which meant &quot;waters of [[Grannus]]&quot;, referring to the [[Celts|Celtic]] god of healing who was worshipped at the springs.&lt;ref name=&quot;munro&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tourism&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Mielke|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This word became ''Åxhe'' in [[Walloon language|Walloon]] and ''Aix'' in French, and subsequently ''Aix-la-Chapelle'' after [[Charlemagne]] had his [[Palatine Chapel, Aachen|palatine chapel]] built there in the late eighth century and then made the city his empire's capital.

Aachen's name in French and German evolved in parallel. The city is known by a variety of different names in other languages:

=== Aachen dialect ===
Aachen is at the western end of the [[Benrath line]] that divides [[High German languages|High German]] to the south from the rest of the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] speech area to the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Aachen's local dialect is called ''[[Aachen dialect|Öcher Platt]]'' and belongs to the [[Ripuarian language]].

== History ==
{{see also|Free Imperial City of Aachen|Timeline of Aachen}}

=== Early history ===
Flint quarries on the [[Lousberg]], Schneeberg, and Königshügel, first used during [[Neolithic]] times (3000–2500 BC), attest to the long occupation of the site of Aachen, as do recent finds under the modern city's ''Elisengarten'' pointing to a former settlement from the same period. [[Bronze Age]] (around 1600 BC) settlement is evidenced by the remains of barrows (burial mounds) found, for example, on the Klausberg. During the [[Iron Age]], the area was settled by Celtic peoples&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schumacher|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who were perhaps drawn by the marshy Aachen basin's [[hot spring|hot sulphur springs]] where they worshipped [[Grannus]], god of light and healing.

Later, the 25-hectare Roman spa resort town of Aquae Granni was, according to legend, founded by Grenus, under [[Hadrian]], around AD 124. Instead, the fictitious founder refers to the Celtic god, and it seems it was the Roman 6th Legion at the start of the 1st century AD that first channelled the hot springs into a spa at Büchel,&lt;ref name=&quot;CVDE&quot; /&gt;{{efn|[http://www.archaeologie-aachen.de/DE/Mediathek/Audio/zeitreise_rundgang/zeitreise_hof.mp3 This audio file] is Andreas Schaub explaining the archaeological record in court in ''Archäologie am Hof''.}} adding at the end of the same century the ''Münstertherme'' spa,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2013a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; two water pipelines, and a probable{{clarify|date=December 2016}} sanctuary dedicated to Grannus. A kind of forum, surrounded by colonnades, connected the two spa complexes. There was also an extensive residential area, part of it inhabited by a flourishing Jewish community.&lt;ref name=&quot;jewishencyclopedia.com&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Freimann|1906|p=301}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans built bathhouses near [[Burtscheid]]. A temple precinct called ''Vernenum'' was built near the modern [[Kornelimünster/Walheim]]. Today, remains have been found of three bathhouses,&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|McClendon|1996|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; including two fountains in the ''Elisenbrunnen'' and the Burtscheid bathhouse.

Roman civil administration in Aachen broke down between the end of the 4th and beginning of the 5th centuries&lt;!--{{Fix|text=This seems rather precise}} What is that supposed to imply?--&gt;. Rome withdrew its troops from the area, but the town remained populated. By 470, the town came to be ruled by the [[Ripuarian Franks]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Coll&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Held|1997|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and subordinated to their capital, [[Cologne]].

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:Construction d Aix-la-Chapelle.jpg|thumb|right|Construction of Aix-la-Chapelle, by [[Jean Fouquet]]]]
[[Image:Aachener Heiligtumszeigung Oelgemaelde 17Jh.jpg|thumb|Presentation of the four &quot;Great Relics&quot; during the Aachen pilgrimage, after a 17th-century painting]]

After Roman times, [[Pepin the Short]] had a castle residence built in the town, due to the proximity of the hot springs and also for strategic reasons as it is located between the [[Rhineland]] and northern France.&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|McClendon|1996a|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Einhard]] mentions that in 765–6 Pepin spent both Christmas and Easter at ''Aquis villa'' (''{{lang|la|Et celebravit natalem Domini in Aquis villa et pascha similiter.}}''),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eginhard|2012|p=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (&quot;and [he] celebrated Christmas in the town Aquis, and similarly Easter&quot;) which must have been sufficiently equipped to support the royal household for several months. In the year of his coronation as king of the [[Francia|Franks]], 768, [[Charlemagne]] came to spend Christmas at Aachen for the first time.{{efn|This is in dispute, as some history books state that Charlemagne was in fact born in Aachen in 742.&lt;ref name=&quot;WB&quot; /&gt;}} He remained there in a mansion which he may have extended, although there is no source attesting to any significant building activity at Aachen in his time, apart from the building of the [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen|Palatine Chapel]] (since 1930, cathedral) and the [[Palace of Aachen|Palace]]. Charlemagne spent most winters in Aachen between 792 and his death in 814. Aachen became the focus of his court and the political centre of his empire. After his death, the king was buried in the church which he had built;&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA5&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|McClendon|1996a|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; his original tomb has been lost, while his alleged remains are preserved in the ''[[Karlsschrein]]'', the shrine where he was reburied after being declared a saint; his saintliness, however, was never officially acknowledged by the Roman Curia as such.

In 936, [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] was crowned king of [[East Francia]] in the collegiate church built by Charlemagne. During the reign of [[Otto II]], the nobles revolted and the [[West Francia|West Frank]]s, under [[Lothair of France|Lothair]],&lt;ref name=&quot;dupuy&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Dupuy|Dupuy|1986|p=258}}.&lt;/ref&gt; raided Aachen in the ensuing confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kitchen|1996|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This was between 970 and 980.&lt;ref name=&quot;dupuy&quot; /&gt;}} Aachen was attacked again by [[Odo II, Count of Blois|Odo of Champagne]], who attacked the imperial palace while [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] was absent. Odo relinquished it quickly and was killed soon afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kitchen|1996|p=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The palace and town of Aachen had fortifying walls built by order of Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] between 1172 and 1176.&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA&quot; /&gt; Over the next 500 years, most kings of [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] destined to reign over the [[Holy Roman Empire]] were crowned in Aachen. The original audience hall built by Charlemagne was torn down and replaced by the current [[Aachen Rathaus|city hall]] in 1330.{{efn|Sources differ on the age of the [[Aachen Rathaus|city hall]], as the dates used for the construction were 1334–1349.&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA&quot; /&gt;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA&quot; /&gt; The last king to be crowned here was [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] in 1531.&lt;ref name=&quot;CVDE&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AAE&quot; /&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]], Aachen remained a city of regional importance, due to its proximity to [[Flanders]]; it achieved a modest position in the trade in [[wool]]len cloths, favoured by imperial privilege. The city remained a [[free imperial city]], subject to the emperor only, but was politically far too weak to influence the policies of any of its neighbours. The only dominion it had was over [[Burtscheid]], a neighbouring territory ruled by a [[Benedictine]] [[abbess]]. It was forced to accept that all of its traffic must pass through the &quot;Aachener Reich&quot;. Even in the late 18th century the Abbess of Burtscheid was prevented from building a road linking her territory to the neighbouring estates of the [[Duchy of Jülich|duke of Jülich]]; the city of Aachen even deployed its handful of soldiers to chase away the road-diggers.

As an imperial city, Aachen held certain political privileges that allowed it to remain independent{{clarify|date=December 2016}} of the troubles of Europe for many years. It remained a direct vassal of the Holy Roman Empire throughout most of the Middle Ages. It was also the site of many important church councils, including the [[Council of 837]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|De Jong|1996|p=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Council of 1166]], a council convened by the [[antipope]] [[Paschal III]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EA&quot; /&gt;

=== Manuscript production ===
Aachen has proved an important site for the production of historical manuscripts. Under Charlemagne's purview, both the [[Aachen Gospels (Ada School)|Ada Gospels]] and the [[Coronation Gospel]]s may have been produced in Aachen.&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA1&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|McKitterick|1996|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, quantities of the other texts in the court library were also produced locally. During the reign of [[Louis the Pious]] (814–840), substantial quantities of ancient texts were produced at Aachen, including legal manuscripts such as the leges scriptorium group, [[patristic]] texts including the five manuscripts of the [[Bamberg Pliny Group]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA1&quot; /&gt; Finally, under [[Lothair I]] (840–855), texts of outstanding quality were still being produced. This however marked the end of the period of manuscript production at Aachen.&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA1&quot; /&gt;

=== 16th–18th centuries ===
[[File:The Siege of Aachen.png|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Siege of Aachen (1614)|siege of Aachen]] by the Spanish Army of Flanders under Ambrogio Spinola in 1614]]
[[File:Rhein-Strom 0184a Achen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|View of Aachen in 1690]]

In 1598, following the invasion of [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] troops from the [[Netherlands]], [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf]] deposed all Protestant office holders in Aachen and even went as far as expelling them from the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holborn|1982|p=295}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From the early 16th century, Aachen started to lose its power and influence. First the coronations of emperors were moved from Aachen to [[Frankfurt]]. This was followed by the religious wars, and the great fire of 1656.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Encyclopædia Britannica Online|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the destruction of most of the city in 1656, the rebuilding was mostly in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style.&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA&quot; /&gt; The decline of Aachen culminated in 1794, when the French, led by General [[Charles Dumouriez]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Coll&quot; /&gt; occupied Aachen.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAE&quot; /&gt;

By the middle of the 17th century Aachen had become attractive as a spa: not so much because of the effects of the hot springs on the health of its visitors but because Aachen was then – and remained well into the 19th century – a place of high-level prostitution. Traces of this hidden agenda of the city's history are found in the 18th-century guidebooks to Aachen as well as to the other spas; the main [[Indication (medicine)|indication]] for visiting patients, ironically, was [[syphilis]]; only by the end of the 19th century had rheumatism become the most important object of cures at Aachen and Burtscheid. Aachen was chosen as the site of several important congresses and peace treaties: the [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|first congress of Aachen]] (often referred to as the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle in English) on 2 May 1668,&lt;ref name=&quot;dupuy1&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Dupuy|Dupuy|1986|p=563}}.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|First Treaty of Aachen]] in the same year which ended the [[War of Devolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holborn|1982a|p=70}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|second congress]] ended with the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|second treaty]] in 1748, ending the [[War of the Austrian Succession]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CVDE&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holborn|1982a|p=217}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1789, there was a constitutional crisis in the Aachen government,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|2004|p=301}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1794 Aachen lost its status as a [[free imperial city]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA&quot; /&gt;

=== 19th century ===
On 9 February 1801, the [[Peace of Lunéville]] removed the ownership of Aachen and the entire &quot;left bank&quot; of the Rhine from Germany and granted it to France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coll&quot; /&gt; In 1815, control of the town was passed to [[Prussia]], by an act passed by the [[Congress of Vienna]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AAE&quot; /&gt; The [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)|third congress]] took place in 1818, to decide the fate of occupied [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]ic France.

By the middle of the 19th century, industrialisation had swept away most of the city's medieval rules of production and commerce, although the entirely corrupt{{clarify|date=December 2016}} remains of the city's medieval constitution were kept in place (compare the famous remarks of Georg Forster in his ''Ansichten vom Niederrhein'') until 1801, when Aachen became the &quot;[[Prefectures in France|chef-lieu]] du [[Roer (department)|département de la Roer]]&quot; in Napoleon's [[First French Empire]]. In 1815, after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] took over. The city was one of its most socially and politically backward centres until the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;CVDE&quot; /&gt; Administered within the [[Rhine Province]], by 1880 the population was 80,000. Starting in 1838, the railway from [[Cologne]] to [[Belgium]] passed through Aachen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holborn|1982b|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The city suffered extreme overcrowding and deplorable sanitary conditions until 1875, when the medieval fortifications were finally abandoned as a limit to building and new, better housing was built in the east of the city, where sanitary drainage was easiest. In December 1880, the [[Trams in Aachen|Aachen tramway network]] was opened, and in 1895 it was electrified.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van der Gragt|1968|p=137}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century and up to the 1930s, the city was important in the production of railway locomotives and carriages, iron, [[pin]]s, [[sewing needle|needles]], [[clothing button|button]]s, tobacco, woollen goods, and silk goods.

=== 20th century ===
[[File:KleineSchwimmhalle.JPG|thumb|The modern Elisabethhalle pool]]
After [[World War I]], Aachen was occupied by the Allies until 1930, along with the rest of German territory west of the Rhine.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAE&quot; /&gt; Aachen was one of the locations involved in the ill-fated [[Rhenish Republic]]. On 21 October 1923, an armed band took over the city hall. Similar actions took place in [[Mönchengladbach|Mönchen-Gladbach]], [[Duisburg]], and [[Krefeld]]. This republic lasted only about a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holborn|1982b|p=614}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Aachen was heavily damaged during [[World War II]]. The city and its fortified surroundings were laid siege to from 12 September to 21 October 1944 by the US 1st Infantry Division&lt;ref name=&quot;1d&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Stanton|2006|p=76}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with the 3rd Armored Division assisting from the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanton|2006|p=51}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 13 October the US 2nd Armored Division played their part, coming from the north and getting as close as [[Würselen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanton|2006|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while the 30th Infantry Division played a crucial role in completing the encirclement of Aachen on 16 October 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanton|2006|p=109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With reinforcements from the US 28th Infantry Division&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanton|2006|p=105}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Battle of Aachen]] then continued involving direct assaults through the heavily defended city, which finally forced the German garrison to surrender on 21 October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;1d&quot; /&gt; Aachen was the first German city to be captured by the Allies, and its residents welcomed the soldiers as liberators.&lt;ref name=&quot;baker2004&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Baker|2004|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The city was destroyed partially – and in some parts completely – during the fighting,&lt;ref name=&quot;CVDE&quot; /&gt; mostly by [[United States Army|American]] [[artillery]] fire and demolitions carried out by the [[Waffen-SS]] defenders. Damaged buildings included the medieval churches of [[Foillan|St. Foillan]], [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] and [[Saint Nicholas|St. Nicholas]], and the [[Aachen Rathaus|Rathaus]] (city hall), although [[Aachen Cathedral]] was largely unscathed. Only 4,000 inhabitants remained in the city; the rest had followed evacuation orders. Its first Allied-appointed mayor, [[Franz Oppenhoff]], was assassinated by an SS commando unit.

==== History of Aachen Jews ====
During the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period, Aachen was the site of a flourishing [[Jewish]] community. Later, during the [[Carolingian]] empire, a Jewish community lived near the royal palace.&lt;ref name=&quot;jewishencyclopedia.com&quot; /&gt; In 802, a Jew named Isaac accompanied the ambassador of [[Charlemagne]] to [[Harun al-Rashid]]. During the 13th century, many Jews converted to Christianity, as shown in the records of the Aachen Minster (today’s cathedral). In 1486, the Jews of Aachen offered gifts to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] during his coronation ceremony. In 1629, the Aachen Jewish community was expelled from the city. In 1667, six Jews were allowed to return. Most of the Aachen Jews settled in the nearby town of [[Burtscheid]]. On 16 May 1815, the Jewish community of the city offered an homage in its synagogue to the Prussian king, [[Friedrich Wilhelm III]]. A Jewish cemetery was acquired in 1851. 1,345 Jews lived in the city in 1933. The synagogue was destroyed during [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938. In 1939, after emigration and arrests, 782 Jews remained in the city. After [[World War II]], only 62 Jews lived there. In 2003, 1,434 Jews were living in Aachen. In Jewish texts, the city of Aachen was called Aish, or Ash (אש).

=== 21st century ===
The city of Aachen has developed into a technology hub as a by-product of hosting one of the leading [[Institute of Technology|universities of technology]] in Germany with the [[RWTH Aachen]] (Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule), known especially for mechanical engineering, automotive and manufacturing technology as well as for its research and academic hospital [[Klinikum Aachen]], one of the largest medical facilities in Europe.

== Geography ==
[[File:Drilandenpunt.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The three-country point, where the borders of Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands meet]]

Aachen is located in the middle of the [[Meuse–Rhine Euroregion]], close to the border [[tripoint]] of Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium. The city of [[Heerlen]] in the Netherlands lies nearby, as does [[Eupen]], the capital of the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]], both located about {{convert|20|km|1|abbr=on}} from Aachen's city centre. Aachen lies near the head of the open valley of the [[Wurm]] (which today flows through the city in canalised form), part of the larger basin of the [[Meuse]], and about {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the [[High Fens]], which form the northern edge of the [[Eifel]] uplands of the [[Rhenish Massif]].

The maximum dimensions of the city's territory are {{convert|21.6|km|1|abbr=on}} from north to south, and {{convert|17.2|km|1|abbr=on}} from east to west. The city limits are {{convert|87.7|km|1|abbr=on}} long, of which {{convert|23.8|km|1|abbr=on}} border Belgium and {{convert|21.8|km|1|abbr=on}} the Netherlands. The highest point in Aachen, located in the far southeast of the city, lies at an elevation of 410&amp;nbsp;m above sea level. The lowest point, in the north, and on the border with the Netherlands, is at 125&amp;nbsp;m.

As the westernmost city in Germany&lt;ref name=&quot;munro&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Munro|1995|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and close to the Low Countries), Aachen and the surrounding area belongs to a [[Temperate climate|temperate climate zone]], with humid weather, mild winters, and warm summers. Because of its location north of the [[Eifel]] and the [[High Fens]] and its subsequent prevailing westerly weather patterns, rainfall in Aachen (on average 805&amp;nbsp;mm/year) is comparatively higher than, for example, in [[Bonn]] (with 669&amp;nbsp;mm/year). Another factor in the local weather forces of Aachen is the occurrence of [[Foehn winds]] on the southerly air currents, which results from the city's geographic location on the northern edge of the Eifel.&lt;ref name=&quot;climate&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2013b}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the city is surrounded by hills, it suffers from [[inversion (meteorology)|inversion-related]] smog. Some areas of the city have become [[urban heat island]]s as a result of poor heat exchange, both because of the area's natural geography and from human activity. The city's numerous cold air corridors, which are slated to remain as free as possible from new construction, therefore play an important role in the urban climate of Aachen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aachen Department of Environmental|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The January average is
{{convert|3.0|°C|0|abbr=on}}, while the July average is {{convert|18.5|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Precipitation is almost evenly spread throughout the year.

== Geology ==
[[File:Aachen Felsen St.Adalbert.JPG|thumb|Layered [[sandstone]] and [[claystone]] [[formation (stratigraphy)|formation]] from the [[Devonian]] period below St. Adalbert Church in Aachen]]

The geology of Aachen is very structurally heterogeneous. The oldest occurring rocks in the area surrounding the city originate from the [[Devonian]] period and include [[carboniferous]] [[sandstone]], [[graywacke]], [[claystone]] and [[limestone]]. These formations are part of the [[Rhenish Massif]], north of the High Fens. In the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] subperiod of the [[Carboniferous]] geological period, these rock layers were narrowed and folded as a result of the [[Variscan orogeny]]. After this event, and over the course of the following 200 million years, this area has been continuously flattened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Anderson|first1= Ernest Masson|editor1-last= Healy|editor1-first= David|year= 2012|title= Faulting, Fracturing and Igneous Intrusion in the Earth's Crust|issue= 367|volume= 367|publisher= Geological Society of London|isbn=1-86239-347-8|issn=0305-8719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cretaceous]] period, the ocean penetrated the continent from the direction of the [[North Sea]] up to the mountainous area near Aachen, bringing with it clay, sand, and chalk deposits. While the clay (which was the basis for a major [[pottery]] industry in nearby [[Raeren]]) is mostly found in the lower areas of Aachen, the hills of the [[Aachen Forest]] and the [[Lousberg]] were formed from upper Cretaceous sand and chalk deposits. More recent sedimentation is mainly located in the north and east of Aachen and was formed through [[tertiary]] and [[quaternary]] river and wind activities.

Along the major [[thrust fault]] of the [[Variscan orogeny]], there are over 30 [[thermal spring]]s in Aachen and [[Burtscheid]]. Additionally, the subsurface of Aachen is traversed by numerous [[active fault]]s that belong to the Rurgraben fault system, which has, in the past, been responsible for numerous earthquakes, including the 1756 [[Düren]] earthquake&lt;ref name=&quot;duerenEQ&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|University of Cologne, Seismological Station Bensberg|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[1992 Roermond earthquake]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Roermond&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Geological Survey of North Rhine-Westphalia|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which was the strongest earthquake ever recorded in the [[Netherlands]].

== Demographics ==
[[File:Age structure aachen vs germany.svg|thumb|Age distribution of Aachen's population next to Germany's (2014)]]

Aachen has 245,885 inhabitants (as of 31 December 2015), of whom 118,272 are female, and 127,613 are male.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zensus 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.it.nrw.de/statistik/a/daten/bevoelkerungszahlen_zensus/zensus_rp3_dez15.html|last=Information und Technik Nordrhein-Westfalen|title=Bevölkerung im Regierungsbezirk Köln|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unemployment rate in the city is, as of April 2012, 9.7 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aktualisierung|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2009, the foreign-born residents of Aachen made up 13.6 percent of the total population.&lt;ref name=&quot;StatJahrbuch2009&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|City of Aachen|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A significant portion of foreign residents are students at the [[RWTH Aachen University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|RWTH Aachen University|2013a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main sights ==

=== Aachen Cathedral ===
[[File:Aachen Germany Imperial-Cathedral-01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Aachen Cathedral]]

[[Aachen Cathedral]] was erected on the orders of [[Charlemagne]] in AD 796&lt;ref name=&quot;EA&quot; /&gt; and was, on completion, in 798,&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA3&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|McClendon|1996a|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the largest cathedral north of the [[Alps]]. It was modelled after the [[Basilica of San Vitale]], in [[Ravenna]], Italy,&lt;ref name=&quot;AAE&quot; /&gt; and was built by [[Odo of Metz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EA&quot; /&gt; Charlemagne also desired for the chapel to compete with the [[Lateran Palace]], both in quality and authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA6&quot; /&gt; It was originally built in the [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] style, including marble covered walls, and mosaic inlay on the dome.&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA4&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|McClendon|1996a|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On his death, Charlemagne's remains were interred in the cathedral and can be seen there to this day. The cathedral was extended several times in later ages, turning it into a curious and unique mixture of building styles. The throne and gallery portion date from the [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]], with portions of the original [[opus sectile]] floor still visible.&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA4&quot; /&gt; The 13th century saw gables being added to the roof, and after the fire of 1656, the dome was rebuilt. Finally, a [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] was added around the start of the 15th century&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA5&quot; /&gt; After, [[Frederick Barbarossa]] [[Canonisation|canonised]] Charlemagne, in 1165, the chapel became a destination for pilgrims.&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA5&quot; /&gt; For 600 years, from 936 to 1531, Aachen Cathedral was the church of coronation for 30 German kings and 12 queens. The church built by Charlemagne is still the main attraction of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|City of Aachen|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to holding the remains of its founder, it became the burial place of his successor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]]. In the upper chamber of the gallery, Charlemagne's marble throne is housed.&lt;ref name=&quot;young2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Young|Stetler|1987|p=273}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Aachen Cathedral has been designated as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Aachen|title=Aachen {{!}} Germany|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the marble and columns used in the construction of the cathedral were brought from [[Rome]] and [[Ravenna]], including the [[sarcophagus]] that Charlemagne was eventually laid to rest in.&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA6&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gaehde|1996|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A bronze bear from [[Gaul]] was placed inside, along with an equestrian statue from Ravenna, believed to be [[Theodric]]. These were in contrast to a wolf and a statue of [[Marcus Aurelius]] in the [[Capitoline]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA6&quot; /&gt; Bronze pieces such as the doors and railings were cast in a local foundry, some of which have survived to the present. Finally, there is uncertainty surrounding the bronze pine cone in the chapel, and where it was created. Wherever it was made, it was also a parallel to a piece in Rome, this in [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA6&quot; /&gt;

=== Cathedral Treasury ===
[[File:Aachen Germany Domschatz Cross-of-Lothair-01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cross of Lothair]], Aachen Cathedral Treasury]]

[[Aachen Cathedral Treasury]] has housed, throughout its history, a collection of liturgical objects. The origin of this [[church treasure]] is in dispute as some say Charlemagne himself endowed his chapel with the original collection, while the rest were collected over time. Others say all of the objects were collected over time, from such places as [[Jerusalem]] and [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA6&quot; /&gt; The location of this treasury has moved over time and was unknown until the 15th, century when it was located in the Matthiaskapelle (St. Matthew's Chapel) until 1873, when it was moved to the Karlskapelle (Charles' Chapel). From there it was moved to the Hungarian Chapel in 1881 and in 1931 to its present location next to the Allerseelenkapelle (Poor Souls' Chapel).&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA6&quot; /&gt; Only six of the original [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] objects have remained, and of those only three are left in Aachen: the [[Aachen Gospels (Ada School)|Aachen Gospels]], a [[diptych]] of [[Christ]], and an early [[Byzantine silk]]. The [[Coronation Gospels]] and a [[St. Stephen's Purse|reliquary burse]] of [[St. Stephen]] were moved to [[Vienna]] in 1798 and the [[Talisman of Charlemagne]] was given as a gift in 1804 to [[Josephine Bonaparte]] and subsequently to [[Rheims Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA6&quot; /&gt; 210 documented pieces have been added to the treasury since its inception, typically to receive in return legitimisation of linkage to the heritage of Charlemagne. The [[Lothar Cross]], the [[Gospels of Otto III]] and multiple additional Byzantine silks were donated by [[Otto III]]. Part of the [[Aachen Cathedral#Pala d'Oro|Pala d'Oro]] and a covering for the [[Aachen Gospels (Ada School)|Aachen Gospels]] were made of gold donated by [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA6&quot; /&gt; [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] donated the candelabrum that adorns the dome and also once &quot;crowned&quot; the [[Karlsschrein|Shrine of Charlemagne]], which was placed underneath in 1215. [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] donated a pair of reliquaries. [[Louis XI]] gave, in 1475, the crown of [[Margaret of York]], and, in 1481, another arm reliquary of Charlemagne. [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] both gave numerous works of art by [[Hans von Reutlingen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA6&quot; /&gt; Continuing the tradition, objects continued to be donated until the present, each indicative of the period of its gifting, with the last documented gift being a chalice from 1960 made by [[Ewald Mataré]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA6&quot; /&gt;

=== Aachen Rathaus ===
[[File:AachenCityHallFromSouthHDR.jpg|thumb|Aachen Rathaus seen from the south]]
The [[Aachen Rathaus]], English '''Aachen City Hall''' or '''Aachen Town Hall''', dated from 1330,&lt;ref name=&quot;WB&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Merkl|2007|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; lies between two central squares, the ''Markt'' (marketplace) and the ''Katschhof'' (between city hall and cathedral). The coronation hall is on the first floor of the building. Inside you can find five frescoes by the Aachen artist [[Alfred Rethel]] which show legendary scenes from the life of Charlemagne, as well as Charlemagne's signature. Also, precious replicas of the [[Imperial Regalia]] are kept here.&lt;ref name=&quot;young2&quot; /&gt;

Since 2009, the city hall has been a station on the ''Route Charlemagne'', a tour programme by which historical sights of Aachen are presented to visitors. At the city hall, a museum exhibition explains the history and art of the building and gives a sense of the historical coronation banquets that took place there. A portrait of [[Napoleon]] from 1807 by [[Louis-André-Gabriel Bouchet]] and one of his wife [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Joséphine]] from 1805 by [[Robert Lefèvre]] are viewable as part of the tour.

As before, the city hall is the seat of the mayor of Aachen and of the city council, and annually the [[Charlemagne Prize]] is awarded there.

=== Other sights ===
The ''Grashaus'', a late medieval house at the ''Fischmarkt'', is one of the oldest non-religious buildings in downtown Aachen. It hosted the city archive, and before that, the Grashaus was the former city hall until the present building took over this function.

The ''Elisenbrunnen'' is one of the most famous sights of Aachen. It is a neo-classical hall covering one of the city's famous fountains. It is just a minute away from the cathedral. Just a few steps in a south-easterly direction lies the 19th-century [[Theater Aachen|theatre]].

Also of note are two remaining city gates, the ''[[Ponttor]]'' (Pont gate), half a mile northwest of the cathedral, and the ''Marschiertor'' (marching gate), close to the central railway station. There are also a few parts of both medieval city walls left, most of them integrated into more recent buildings, but some others still visible. There are even five towers left, some of which are used for housing.

[[St. Michael's Church, Aachen]] was built as a church of the Aachen Jesuit Collegium in 1628. It is attributed to the Rhine mannerism and a sample of a local Renaissance-architecture. The rich façade remained unfinished until 1891 when the historistic architect Peter Friedrich Peters added to it. The church is a Greek Orthodox church today, but the building is used also for concerts because of its good acoustics.

The Jewish synagogue in Aachen which was destroyed on the [[Night of Broken Glass]] ([[Kristallnacht]]), 9 November 1938, was reinaugurated on 18 May 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knufinke|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the contributors for the reconstructions of the synagogue was [[Jürgen Linden]], the Lord Mayor of Aachen from 1989 to 2009.

There are numerous other notable churches and [[monastery|monasteries]], a few remarkable 17th- and 18th-century buildings in the particular [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style typical of the region, a Jewish synagogue, a collection of statues and monuments, park areas, cemeteries, among others. Among the museums in the town are the [[Suermondt-Ludwig Museum]], which has a fine sculpture collection and the [[Aachen Museum of the International Press]], which is dedicated to newspapers from the 16th century to the present.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area's industrial history is reflected in dozens of 19th- and early 20th-century manufacturing sites in the city.

There have been a number of spin-offs from the university's [[Information technology|IT]] technology department.

Aachen is the administrative centre for the coal-mining industries in neighbouring places to the northeast.&lt;ref name=&quot;DofA&quot; /&gt;

Products manufactured in Aachen include electrical goods, textiles, foodstuffs (chocolate and candy), glass, machinery, rubber products, furniture, metal products.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohen&quot; /&gt; Also in and around{{clarify|reason=don't want &quot;around.&quot; Want stuff that is in the city.

=== Electric vehicle manufacturing ===
[[File:2016-12-10-Post Streetscooter-9409.jpg|thumb|StreetScooter ''Work'' as DHL delivery van (2016)]]

In June 2010, Achim Kampker, together with Günther Schuh, founded a small company to develop Street Scooter GmbH; in August 2014, it was renamed StreetScooter GmbH. This was a privately organized research initiative at the [[RWTH Aachen University]] which later became an independent company in Aachen. Kampker was also the founder and chairman of the [[European Network for Affordable and Sustainable Electromobility]]. In May 2014, the company announced that the city of Aachen, the city council Aachen and the savings bank Aachen had ordered electric vehicles from the company. In late 2014, approximately 70 employees were manufacturing 200 vehicles annually in the premises of the [[Waggonfabrik Talbot]], the former Talbot/Bombardier plant in Aachen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhl.com/en/press/releases/releases_2014/group/dpdhl_acquires_streetscooter_gmbh.html |title=Deutsche Post DHL acquires StreetScooter GmbH |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=9 December 2014 |website=DHL |publisher=DHL |access-date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014 [[Deutsche Post|Deutsche Post DHL Group]] purchased the StreetScooter company, which became its wholly owned subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpdhl.com/de/presse/pressemitteilungen/2014/deutsche_post_dhl_uebernimmt_streetscooter_gmbh.html Deutsche Post DHL übernimmt StreetScooter GmbH] 9.&lt;/ref&gt; By April 2016, the company announced that it would produce 2000 of its electric vans branded ''Work'' in Aachen by the end of the year.

In April 2016, [[StreetScooter]] GmbH announced that it would be scaling up to manufacture approximately 10,000 of the ''Work'' vehicles annually, starting in 2017, also in Aachen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/unternehmen/der-tausendste-elektro-streetscooter-der-deutschen-post-14401894.html |title=Streetscooter - Der tausendste Elektro-Transporter der Post |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=23 August 2016 |website=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  |publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung GmbH |access-date=26 March 2017 |quote=Die Post will ihren gesamten Fuhrpark auf Elektro-Autos umstellen.

[[File:Aachen Rosenmontag 2009.jpg|thumb|Aachen is also famous for its [[carnival]] (Karneval, Fasching), in which families dress in colourful costumes]]

In 1372, Aachen became the first coin-minting city in the world to regularly place an [[Anno Domini]] date on a general circulation [[coin]], a [[groschen]].

The [[Scotch-Club]] in Aachen was the first [[discothèque]]; it has been open since 19 October 1959. Klaus Quirini as DJ Heinrich was the first DJ ever.

The thriving Aachen [[black metal]] scene is among the most notable in Germany, with such bands as [[Nagelfar]], [[The Ruins of Beverast]], Graupel and Verdunkeln.

The local speciality of Aachen is an originally hard type of sweet bread, baked in large flat loaves, called ''[[Aachener Printen]]''. Unlike ''[[Lebkuchen]]'', a German form of [[gingerbread]] sweetened with honey, ''Printen'' use a syrup made from sugar. Today, a soft version is sold under the same name which follows an entirely different recipe.

== Education ==

[[RWTH Aachen|RWTH Aachen University]], established as Polytechnicum in 1870, is one of [[German Universities Excellence Initiative|Germany's Universities of Excellence]] with strong emphasis on technological research, especially for electrical and mechanical engineering, computer sciences, physics, and chemistry. The university clinic attached to the RWTH, the [[Klinikum Aachen]], is the biggest single-building hospital in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aachen Institute for Advanced Study in Computational Engineering Science|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, a host of software and computer industries have developed around the university. It also maintains a [[botanical garden]] (the [[Botanischer Garten Aachen]]).

[[FH Aachen]], [[Aachen University of Applied Sciences]] (AcUAS) was founded in 1971. The AcUAS offers a classic engineering education in professions such as [[mechatronics]], construction engineering, mechanical engineering or electrical engineering. German and international students are educated in more than 20 international or foreign-oriented programmes and can acquire German as well as international degrees (Bachelor/Master) or ''Doppelabschlüsse'' (double degrees). Foreign students account for more than 21% of the student body.

The Katholische Hochschule Nordrhein-Westfalen – Abteilung Aachen (Catholic University of Applied Sciences Northrhine-Westphalia – Aachen department)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Catholic University of Applied Sciences|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers its some 750 students a variety of degree programmes: social work, childhood education, nursing, and co-operative management. It also has the only programme of study in Germany especially designed for mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Catholic University of Applied Sciences|2014a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hochschule für Musik und Tanz Köln]] ([[Cologne University of Music]]) is one of the world's foremost performing arts schools and one of the largest music institutions for higher education in Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Academy of Music and Dance Cologne|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with one of its three campuses in Aachen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Academy of Music and Dance Cologne|2014a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aachen campus substantially contributes to the Opera/Musical Theatre master's programme by collaborating with the [[Theater Aachen]] and the recently established musical theatre chair through the Rheinische Opernakademie.

The [[German Army]]'s Technical School (''Ausbildungszentrum Technik Landsysteme'') is in Aachen.&lt;ref name=&quot;MeerOpitz1998&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Van der Meer|Richter|Opitz|1998|p=718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sports ==
[[File:Aachen Tivoli under construction.JPG|thumb|left|[[New Tivoli]], home ground of [[Alemannia Aachen]]]]

The annual CHIO (short for the French term ''Concours Hippique International Officiel'') is the biggest [[equestrianism|equestrian]] meeting of the world and among horsemen is considered to be as prestigious for equitation as the tournament of [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] for tennis. Aachen hosted the [[2006 FEI World Equestrian Games]].

The local [[Association football|football]] team [[Alemannia Aachen]] had a short run-out in Germany's [[Fußball-Bundesliga|first division]], after its promotion in 2006. However, the team could not sustain its status and is now back in the fourth division. The stadium [[Old Tivoli|&quot;Tivoli&quot;]], opened in 1928, served as the venue for the team's home games and was well known for its incomparable atmosphere throughout the whole of the second division.&lt;ref name=&quot;GdawietzLeroi2007&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gdawietz|Leroi|2008|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the old stadium's demolition in 2011, it was used by amateurs, whilst the Bundesliga Club held its games in the new stadium &quot;Neuer Tivoli&quot; – meaning [[New Tivoli]]—a couple of metres down the road. The building work for the stadium which has a capacity of 32,960, began in May 2008 and was completed by the beginning of 2009.

The city's biggest tennis club, &quot;TC Grün Weiss&quot;, annually hosts the ATP Tournament.

The Ladies In Black women's volleyball team (part of the &quot;PTSV Aachen&quot; sports club since 2013) has played in the first German volleyball league (DVL) since 2008.

== Transport ==
=== Rail ===
Aachen's railway station, the [[Aachen Central Station|Hauptbahnhof]] (Central Station), was constructed in 1841 for the [[Cologne–Aachen high-speed railway|Cologne–Aachen railway line]]. In 1905 it was moved closer to the city centre. It serves main lines to Cologne, [[Aachen–Mönchengladbach railway|Mönchengladbach]] and [[HSL 3|Liège]] as well as branch lines to [[Heerlen]], [[Alsdorf]], [[Stolberg (Rhineland)|Stolberg]] and [[Eschweiler]]. [[Intercity-Express|ICE high speed trains]] from [[Brussels]] via [[Cologne]] to [[Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Thalys]] trains from Paris to Cologne also stop at Aachen Central Station. Four [[Regional-Express|RE]] lines and two [[Regionalbahn|RB]] lines connect Aachen with the [[Ruhr]]gebiet, Mönchengladbach, Spa (Belgium), [[Düsseldorf]] and the [[Siegerland]]. The ''[[Euregiobahn]]'', a regional railway system, reaches several minor cities in the Aachen region.

There are four smaller stations in Aachen: ''[[Aachen West station|Aachen West]]'', ''[[Aachen Schanz station|Aachen Schanz]]'', ''[[Aachen-Rothe Erde station|Aachen-Rothe Erde]]'' and ''[[Eilendorf station|Eilendorf]]''. Slower trains stop at these. Aachen West has gained in importance with the expansion of [[RWTH Aachen University]].

=== Public transport ===
[[File:OecherLongWajong1.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bi-articulated bus]] of the city's transit authority ASEAG, at the [[Klinikum Aachen|university hospital]] bus stop]]

The first horse tram line in Aachen opened in December 1880. After electrification in 1895, it was with maximal {{convert|213.5|km|mi}} in 1915 the fourth-longest tram system in Germany. Many tram lines extended to the surrounding towns of [[Herzogenrath]], [[Stolberg (Rheinland)]], [[Alsdorf]] as well as the Belgian and Dutch communes of [[Vaals]], [[Kelmis]] (then ''Altenberg'') and [[Eupen]]. The Aachen tram system was linked with the [[Vicinal tramway|Belgian national interurban tram system]]. Like many tram systems in Western Europe, the Aachen tram suffered from not well-maintained infrastructure and was so deemed unnecessary and disrupting for car drivers by local politics. On 28 September 1974 the last line 15 (Vaals–Brand) operated for one last day and was then replaced by buses. A proposal to reinstate a tram/light rail system under the name ''Campusbahn'' was dropped after a referendum.

Today, the ASEAG (''Aachener Straßenbahn und Energieversorgungs-AG'', literally &quot;Aachen tram and power supply company&quot;) operates an {{convert|1240.8|km|mi}} long bus network with 68 bus routes. Because of the location at the border, many bus routes extend to Belgium and the Netherlands. Lines 14 to Eupen, Belgium and 44 to Heerlen, Netherlands are jointly operated with [[Société Régionale Wallonne du Transport|Transport en Commun]] and [[Veolia Transport Nederland]], respectively.
ASEAG is one of the main participants in the [[Aachener Verkehrsverbund]], a tariff association in the region.

=== Roads ===
Aachen is connected to the [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] (West-East), [[Bundesautobahn 44|A44]] (North-South) and A544 (a smaller motorway from the A4 to the ''Europaplatz'' near the city centre). There are plans to eliminate traffic jams at the Aachen road interchange.

=== Airport ===
[[Maastricht Aachen Airport]] {{airport codes|MST|EHBK}} is the main airport of Aachen and [[Maastricht]]. It is located around 15 NM (28&amp;nbsp;km; 17&amp;nbsp;mi) northwest of Aachen. There is a shuttle-service between Aachen and the airport.

== Charlemagne Prize ==
{{main article|Charlemagne Prize}}
[[File:Angela Merkel, Karlspreisverleihung 2008 - 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[Chancellor of Germany]] [[Angela Merkel]], wearing the Charlemagne Prize awarded to her in 2008]]

Since 1950, a committee of Aachen citizens annually awards the Charlemagne Prize ({{lang-de|link=no|Karlspreis}}) to personalities of outstanding service to the unification of Europe. It is traditionally awarded on [[Ascension Day]] at the [[Aachen Rathaus|City Hall]]. In 2016, the Charlemagne Award was awarded to [[Pope Francis]].

The International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen was awarded in the year 2000 to US president [[Bill Clinton]], for his special personal contribution to co-operation with the states of Europe, for the preservation of peace, freedom, democracy and [[human rights in Europe]], and for his support of the enlargement of the European Union. In 2004, [[Pope John Paul II]]'s efforts to unite Europe were honoured with an &quot;Extraordinary Charlemagne Medal&quot;, which was awarded for the only time ever.
