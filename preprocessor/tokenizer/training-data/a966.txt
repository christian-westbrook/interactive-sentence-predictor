'''American Airlines Flight 77''' was a scheduled [[American Airlines]] domestic [[transcontinental flight|transcontinental]] [[Airline|passenger flight]] from [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in [[Dulles, Virginia]], to [[Los Angeles International Airport]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]. The [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757-223]] aircraft serving the flight was [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] by five men affiliated with [[al-Qaeda]] on September 11, 2001, as part of the [[September 11 attacks]]. They deliberately crashed the plane into [[the Pentagon]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia]], near [[Washington, D.C.]], killing all 64 people on board, including the five hijackers and six crew, as well as 125 people in the building.

Less than 35&amp;nbsp;minutes into the flight, the hijackers stormed the cockpit. They forced the passengers, crew, and pilots to the rear of the aircraft. [[Hani Hanjour]], one of the hijackers who was trained as a pilot, assumed control of the flight. Unknown to the hijackers, passengers aboard made telephone calls to friends and family and relayed information on the hijacking.

The hijackers crashed the aircraft into the western side of the Pentagon at 09:37 EDT. Many people witnessed the crash, and news sources began reporting on the incident within minutes. The impact severely damaged an area of the Pentagon and caused a large fire. A portion of the building collapsed; firefighters spent days working to fully extinguish the blaze. The damaged sections of the Pentagon were rebuilt in 2002, with occupants moving back into the completed areas that August. The 184 victims of the attack are memorialized in the [[Pentagon Memorial]] adjacent to the crash site. The {{convert|1.93|acre|m2|sing=on}} park contains a bench for each of the victims, arranged according to their year of birth and ranging from 1930 to 1998.

Hanjour trained at the CRM Airline Training Center in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], earning his [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] [[Commercial pilot license|commercial pilot's certificate]] in April 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Four Planes, Four Coordinated Teams |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/graphics/attack/hijackers.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |year=2001 |accessdate=June 17, 2001 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5Jpzgnno8?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/graphics/attack/hijackers.html |archivedate=October 23, 2006 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had wanted to be a commercial pilot for the [[Saudia|Saudi national airline]] but was rejected when he applied to the civil aviation school in [[Jeddah]] in 1999.

[[Alec Station]], the CIA's unit dedicated to tracking Osama bin Laden, had discovered that two of the other hijackers, al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar, had multiple-entry visas to the United States well before 9/11.

In December 2000, Hanjour arrived in [[San Diego]], joining &quot;muscle&quot; hijackers [[Nawaf al-Hazmi]] and [[Khalid al-Mihdhar]], who had been there since January 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;911 ch7&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Goldstein |first=Amy |title=Hijackers Led Core Group |work = The Washington Post |url=http://www.pulitzer.org/year/2002/national-reporting/works/093001.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505123208/http://www.pulitzer.org/year/2002/national-reporting/works/093001.html |archivedate=May 5, 2008 |date=September 30, 2001 |accessdate=May 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after arriving, Hanjour and Hazmi left for [[Mesa, Arizona]], where Hanjour began refresher training at Arizona Aviation.&lt;ref name=&quot;911 ch7&quot; /&gt;

===Suspected accomplices===
According to a U.S. State Department cable leaked in the WikiLeaks dump in February 2010, the FBI has investigated another suspect, Mohammed al-Mansoori. He had associated with three [[Qatar]]i citizens who flew from Los Angeles to London (via Washington) and Qatar on the eve of the attacks, after allegedly surveying the [[World Trade Center (1973â€“2001)|World Trade Center]] and the [[White House]]. U.S. law enforcement officials said that the data about the four men was &quot;just one of many leads that were thoroughly investigated at the time and never led to terrorism charges&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSNBC&quot; /&gt; An official added that the three Qatari citizens have never been questioned by the FBI. [[Eleanor Hill]], the former staff director for the congressional joint inquiry on the September 11 attacks, said the cable reinforces questions about the thoroughness of the FBI's investigation. She also said that the inquiry concluded that the hijackers had a support network that helped them in different ways.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSNBC&quot; /&gt;

The three Qatari men were booked to fly from Los Angeles to Washington on September 10, 2001, on the same plane that was hijacked and piloted into the Pentagon on the following day. Instead, they flew from Los Angeles to Qatar, via Washington and London. While the cable said that Mansoori was currently under investigation, U.S. law enforcement officials said that there was no active investigation of him or of the Qatari citizens mentioned in the cable.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSNBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Isikoff|first=Michael|publisher=MSNBC|title=WikiLeaks cable revives talk of 9/11 support network|date=February 2, 2011|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/41400106/ns/us_news-security/|accessdate=February 18, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211203506/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/41400106/ns/us_news-security/|archivedate=February 11, 2011|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hijackers were all selected for extra screening of their checked bags.

The [[9/11 Commission]] estimated that the flight was hijacked between 08:51 and 08:54, shortly after [[American Airlines Flight 11]] struck the [[World Trade Center (1973â€“2001)|World Trade Center]] and not too long after [[United Airlines Flight 175]] had been hijacked.

The FAA was aware at this point that there was an emergency on board the airplane. By this time, Flight 11 had already crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center and Flight 175 was known to have been hijacked and was within minutes of striking the South Tower. After learning of this second hijacking involving an American Airlines aircraft and the hijacking involving [[United Airlines]], American Airlines' executive vice president Gerard Arpey ordered a nationwide ground stop for the airline.&lt;ref name=&quot;911-ch1&quot;/&gt; The Indianapolis Air Traffic Control Center, as well as American Airlines dispatchers, made several failed attempts to contact the aircraft.

Former [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown University]] basketball coach [[John Thompson (basketball)|John Thompson]] had originally booked a ticket on Flight 77. As he would tell the story many times in the following years, including a September 12, 2011 interview on [[Jim Rome]]'s [[The Jim Rome Show|radio show]], he had been scheduled to appear on that show on September 12, 2001. Thompson was planning to be in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] for a friend's birthday on September 13, and initially insisted on traveling to Rome's Los Angeles studio on the 11th. However, this did not work for the show, which wanted him to travel on the day of the show. After a Rome staffer personally assured Thompson that he would be able to travel from Los Angeles to Las Vegas immediately after the show, Thompson changed his travel plans. He felt the impact from the crash at his home near the Pentagon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/collegebasketballnation/post/_/id/35169/john-thompsons-surreal-911-story |title=John Thompson's surreal 9/11 story |first=Eamonn |last=Brennan |work=College Basketball Nation Blog |publisher=''[[ESPN.com]]'' |date=September 12, 2011 |accessdate=September 16, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408221930/http://espn.go.com/blog/collegebasketballnation/post/_/id/35169/john-thompsons-surreal-911-story |archivedate=April 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rescue efforts began immediately after the crash. Almost all the successful rescues of survivors occurred within half an hour of the impact.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pent51&quot;&gt;Goldberg et al., p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, rescue efforts were led by the military and civilian employees within the building.

As firefighters attempted to extinguish the fires, they watched the building in fear of a structural collapse. One firefighter remarked that they &quot;pretty much knew the building was going to collapse because it started making weird sounds and creaking&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pent80&quot; /&gt; Officials saw a cornice of the building move and ordered an evacuation. Minutes later, at 10:10, the upper floors of the damaged area of the Pentagon collapsed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pent80&quot; /&gt; The collapsed area was about {{convert|95|ft|m|0}} at its widest point and {{convert|50|ft|m|0}} at its deepest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pent80&quot; /&gt; The amount of time between impact and collapse allowed everyone on the fourth and fifth levels to evacuate safely before the structure collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg et al., p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; After the collapse, the interior fires intensified, spreading through all five floors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pent86&quot;&gt;Goldberg et al., pp. 86â€“90.&lt;/ref&gt; After 11:00, firefighters mounted a two-pronged attack against the fires. Officials estimated temperatures of up to {{convert|2000|Â°F|Â°C}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pent86&quot; /&gt; While progress was made against the interior fires by late afternoon, firefighters realized a flammable layer of wood under the Pentagon's slate roof had caught fire and begun to spread.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pent91&quot;&gt;Goldberg et al., pp. 91â€“95.&lt;/ref&gt; Typical firefighting tactics were rendered useless by the reinforced structure as firefighters were unable to reach the fire to extinguish it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pent91&quot; /&gt; Firefighters instead made [[firebreak]]s in the roof on September 12 to prevent further spreading. At 18:00 on the 12th, Arlington County issued a press release stating the fire was &quot;controlled&quot; but not fully &quot;extinguished&quot;. Firefighters continued to put out smaller fires that ignited in the succeeding days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pent91&quot; /&gt;

The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] released filmed footage on May 16, 2006, that was recorded by a security camera of American Airlines Flight&amp;nbsp;77 crashing into the Pentagon, with a plane visible in one frame, as a &quot;thin white blur&quot; and an explosion following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12818225/ |title=Video of 9/11 plane hitting Pentagon is released |publisher=MSNBC |date=May 16, 2006 |accessdate=June 10, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124215615/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12818225/ |archivedate=January 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The images were made public in response to a December 2004 [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request by [[Judicial Watch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Judicial Watch Obtains September 11 Pentagon Video |url=http://www.judicialwatch.org/5772.shtml |publisher=[[Judicial Watch]] |date=May 16, 2006 |accessdate=June 11, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511221056/http://www.judicialwatch.org/5772.shtml |archivedate=May 11, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some still images from the video had previously been released and publicly circulated, but this was the first official release of the edited video of the crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/03/07/gen.pentagon.pictures/ |title=Images show September 11 Pentagon crash |publisher=CNN |date=March 8, 2002 |accessdate=June 11, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080531134018/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/03/07/gen.pentagon.pictures/| archivedate= May 31, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A nearby [[Citgo]] service station also had security cameras, but a video released on September 15, 2006 did not show the crash because the camera was pointed away from the crash site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.judicialwatch.org/5965.shtml |title=CITGO Gas Station Cameras Near Pentagon Evidently Did Not Capture Attack |date=September 15, 2006 |publisher=Judicial Watch |accessdate=June 11, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501110315/http://www.judicialwatch.org/5965.shtml |archivedate=May 1, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Videotapes dispel conspiracy; Plane, not missile seen hitting Pentagon on 9/11 |work = The Washington Times |date=May 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Doubletree]] Hotel, located nearby in Crystal City, Virginia, also had a security camera video. The FBI released the video on December 4, 2006, in response to a FOIA lawsuit filed by Scott Bingham. The footage is &quot;grainy and the focus is soft, but a rapidly growing tower of smoke is visible in the distance on the upper edge of the frame as the plane crashes into the building&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kwtx.com/home/headlines/4821121.html |title=FBI Releases New Footage of 9/11 Pentagon Attack |publisher=[[KWTX-TV]] |date=December 4, 2006 |accessdate=June 11, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208062128/http://www.kwtx.com/home/headlines/4821121.html |archivedate=December 8, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
