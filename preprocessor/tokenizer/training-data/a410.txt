{{Politics of Armenia}}
[[Armenia]] has maintained a policy of complementarism by trying to have positive and friendly relations with Iran, Russia, and the West, including the United States and the [[European Union]] since its independence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://times.am/2010/03/29/armenian-foreign-policy-between-russia-iran-and-u-s/ – &quot;Armenian Foreign Policy Between Russia, Iran And U.S.&quot; – 29 March 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724192109/http://times.am/2010/03/29/armenian-foreign-policy-between-russia-iran-and-u-s/ |date=24 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has full membership status in a number of international organizations and observer status, etc. in some others. However, the dispute over the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915 and the recent war over Nagorno–Karabakh have created tense relations with two of its immediate neighbors, Azerbaijan and Turkey.

==Armenian Genocide recognition==
{{Main article|Recognition of the Armenian Genocide}}
[[File:Nations recognising the Armenian Genocide.png|thumb|200px|left|Political map showing states which have officially recognized the Armenian Genocide]]
As of 2017, 29 states have officially recognized the historical events as genocide. Parliaments of countries that recognize the Armenian Genocide include Argentina, Armenia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Cyprus, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Lebanon, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Paraguay, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Uruguay, Vatican City and Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.armenian-genocide.org/current_category.7/affirmation_list.html|title=Resolutions, Laws, and Declarations|website=www.armenian-genocide.org|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some regional governments of countries recognize the Armenian genocide too, such as [[New South Wales]] and [[South Australia]] in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://armenianweekly.com/2009/03/25/south-australia-passes-armenian-genocide-motion/|title=South Australia Passes Armenian Genocide Motion|last=Hairenik|date=25 March 2009|website=Armenian Weekly|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LA19970417004 |title=Armenian Genocide Commemoration - 17/04/1997 - NSW Parliament |date=19 January 2012 |access-date=6 June 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119075550/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LA19970417004 |archivedate=19 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.am/eng/news/12175.html|title=Scotland, North Ireland and Wales recognize Armenian Genocide|website=news.am|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.am/eng/news/155362.html|title=Parliament of Scotland passes motion on Armenian Genocide|website=news.am|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[US House Resolution 106]] was introduced on 30 January 2007, and later referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.

==Disputes==

=== Nagorno-Karabakh and independent republic ===
{{see also|Nagorno-Karabakh conflict}}
Armenia supports Armenians in the [[Republic of Artsakh]] in the longstanding, and very bitter conflict against the Azerbaijani government.

The current conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh began in 1988 when Armenian demonstrations against Azerbaijani rule broke out in Nagorno–Karabakh and later in Armenia and the Nagorno-Karabakh [[Supreme Soviet]] voted to secede from Azerbaijan and join Armenia. Soon, violence broke out against Armenians in Azerbaijan and Azeris in Armenia. In 1990, after violent episodes in Nagorno–Karabakh and Azerbaijani cities like [[Baku]], [[Sumgait]] and [[Kirovabad]], Moscow declared a state of emergency in Karabakh, sending troops to the region, and [[Black January|forcibly occupied Baku]], killing over a hundred civilians. In April 1991, Azerbaijani militia and Soviet forces targeted Armenian populations in Karabakh, known as [[Operation Ring]]. Moscow also deployed troops to [[Yerevan]]. Following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], conflict escalated into a full-scale war between the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, supported by Armenia and Azerbaijan. Military action was influenced by the Russian military, which inspired and manipulated the rivalry between the two neighbouring sides in order to keep both under control.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

More than 30,000 people were killed in the fighting during the period of 1988 to 1994. In May 1992, Armenian forces seized [[Shusha]] and [[Lachin]] (thereby linking Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia). By October 1993, Armenian forces succeeded in taking almost all of former NKAO, Lachin and large areas in southwestern Azerbaijan. In 1993, the [[UN Security Council]] adopted [[List of United Nations Security Council resolutions on the Nagorno-Karabakh War|four resolutions]] calling for the cessation of hostilities, unimpeded access for international humanitarian relief efforts, and the eventual deployment of a peacekeeping force in the region. Fighting continued, however, until May 1994 at which time Russia brokered a cease-fire between the three sides.

Negotiations to resolve the conflict peacefully have been ongoing since 1992 under the aegis of the Minsk Group of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]. The Minsk Group is co-chaired by Russia, France, and the United States and has representation from Turkey, the U.S., several European nations, Armenia and Azerbaijan. Despite the 1994 cease-fire, sporadic violations, [[sniper]]-fire and [[land mine|landmine]] incidents continue to claim over 100 lives each year.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Since 1997, the Minsk Group co-chairs have presented three proposals to serve as a framework for resolving the conflict. Each proposal was rejected. Beginning in 1999, the presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia initiated a direct dialogue through a series of face-to-face meetings, often facilitated by the Minsk Group Co-Chairs. The OSCE sponsored a round of negotiations between the presidents in [[Key West]], Florida. U.S. Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] launched the talks 3 April 2001, and the negotiations continued with mediation by the U.S., Russia and France until 6 April 2001. The Co-Chairs are still continuing to work with the two presidents in the hope of finding a lasting peace.

The two countries are still at war. Citizens of the Republic of Armenia, as well as citizens of any other country who are of [[Armenian diaspora|Armenian descent]], are forbidden entry to the Republic of Azerbaijan. If a person's passport shows evidence of travel to Nagorno–Karabakh, they are forbidden entry to the Republic of Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncsj.org/Azerbaijan.shtml |title=Azerbaijan Country Page of the ''NCSJ'' (advocates on behalf of Jews in Russia, Ukraine, the Baltic States &amp; Eurasia) accessed 23 May 2010 |accessdate=2010-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308021931/http://www.ncsj.org/Azerbaijan.shtml |archivedate=8 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;panarmenian.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/world/news/25889/|title=Azerbaijan doesn't allow Armenians in the country|work=PanARMENIAN.Net|access-date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, in what became known as the [[2008 Mardakert Skirmishes]], Armenia forces and Azerbaijan clashed over Nagorno-Karabakh. The fighting between the sides was brief, with few casualties on either side.&lt;ref name=&quot;regnum.ru&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.regnum.ru/english/943595.html |title=Azerbaijani president: Armenians are guests in Yerevan |publisher=[[REGNUM News Agency]] |date=17 January 2008 |access-date=21 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612043901/http://www.regnum.ru/english/943595.html |archivedate=12 June 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

|No diplomatic relations
|See [[Armenia–Azerbaijan relations]], [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]], [[Sumgait pogrom]], [[Baku pogrom]], [[Maraga massacre]], [[Khachkar destruction in Nakhichevan]]
The two nations have fought two wars in [[Armenian–Azerbaijani War|1918–20 (Armenian–Azerbaijani War)]] and in [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|1988–94 (Nagorno-Karabakh War)]], in the past century, with last one ended with provisional cease fire agreement signed in Bishkek. There are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries, because of the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and dispute.

During the Soviet period, many Armenians and Azeris lived in relative peace under the Soviet iron fist. However, when Mikhail Gorbachev introduced the policies of Glasnost and Perestroika, the majority of Armenians from the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast|Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO)]] of the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan SSR]] began a movement to unify with the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenian SSR]]. In 1988, the Armenians of Karabakh voted to secede and join [[Armenia]]. This, along with sporadic massacres in Azerbaijan against Armenians resulted in the conflict that became known as the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. The violence resulted in ''de facto'' Armenian control of former NKAO and seven surrounding Azerbaijani regions which was effectively halted when the three sides agreed to observe a cease-fire which has been in effect since May 1994, and in late 1995 the sides also agreed to mediation of the OSCE Minsk Group. The Minsk Group is co-chaired by the [[United States|U.S.]], [[France]] and [[Russia]], and comprises [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkey]] and several [[Western europe during the cold war|Western European nations]]. Despite the cease fire, up to 40 clashes are reported along the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict lines of control each year.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The sides are still technically at war. Citizens of the Republic of Armenia, as well as citizens of any other country who are of Armenian descent, are forbidden entry to the Republic of Azerbaijan.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; If a person's passport shows any evidence of travel to [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], they are forbidden to enter the Republic of Azerbaijan.&lt;sup&gt;[54]&lt;/sup&gt;

In 2008, in what became known as the [[2008 Mardakert skirmishes|2008 Mardakert Skirmishes]], Armenia and Azerbaijan clashed over [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic|Nagorno-Karabakh.]] The fighting between the three sides was brief, with few casualties on either side.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;

|See [[Armenia–Georgia relations]]

Armenians and Georgians have a lot in common. Both are ancient Christian civilizations with their own distinct alphabets. Both use the terms &quot;Apostolic&quot; and &quot;Orthodox&quot; in the full titles of their respective churches. They also use the term &quot;Catholicos&quot; to refer to their church patriarchs. Despite all this, however, Armenians and Georgians have tended to have a tenuous relationship (at times, sharing close bonds while at other times regarding each other as rivals).

Today, relations with Georgia are of particular importance for Armenia because, under the economic blockade imposed by Turkey and Azerbaijan due to the ongoing [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|Karabakh conflict]], Georgia offers Armenia its only land connection with Europe and access to its [[Black Sea]] ports. However, because of Armenia's reliance on Russia and Georgia, both of whom fought the [[Russo-Georgian War|2008 South Ossetia wa]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;r and severed diplomatic and economic relations as a result; and as 70% of Armenia's imports entered via Georgia especially from Russia which has imposed an economic blockade on Georgia, Armenia also has been indirectly affected from this blockade as well. The development of close relations between Turkey and Georgia (such as the [[Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline|Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline]] and [[South Caucasus Pipeline|South Caucasus natural gas pipeline]]) have also weighed on the mutual relations. For example, on 20 March 2006, Georgian Ambassador to Armenia Revaz Gachechiladze stated, &quot;We sympathize with the sister nation but taking decisions of the kind we should take into account the international situation. When the time comes Georgia will do everything within the limits of the possible for the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by the international community including Georgia.&quot;&lt;sup&gt;[59]&lt;/sup&gt; However, Armenian-Georgian relations have begun to improve. On 10 May 2006, Armenia and Georgia agreed on the greater part of the lines of the state border between the two countries.&lt;sup&gt;[60]&lt;/sup&gt; The [[Javakheti-Armenian Uplands|Javakheti]] region in southern Georgia contains a large Armenian population and although there have been local civic organizations (such as United [[Javakheti|Javakhk]]) pushing for autonomy, there has been no violence between Armenians and Georgians in the area.

Armenian-Lebanese relations are very friendly. Lebanon is host to the eighth largest Armenian population in the world with around 160,000 Armenians in the country. Lebanon is the only member of the [[Arab League]], much less of the Middle East and the [[Islamic World]] that recognizes the [[Armenian Genocide]]. During the [[2006 Lebanon War]], Armenia announced that it would send humanitarian aid to Lebanon. According to the Armenian government, an unspecified amount of medicines, tents and fire-fighting equipment was allocated to Lebanese authorities on 27 July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2006/07/EB9E5465-7B17-4A96-B513-03AA0567FAB0.ASP Armenia To Provide Relief To Lebanon], Armenialiberty.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panarmenian.net/news/eng/?nid=18992&amp;page=1 Armenia Sent Humanitarian Assistance To Lebanon], PanArmenian.Net&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan is a major supporter of Azerbaijan during and after the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. Pakistan also does not recognize Armenia despite Armenia recognizing Pakistan.

|{{flag|Turkey}}||align=right|&lt;!--start date --&gt; No formal diplomatic relations
|See [[Armenia–Turkey relations]]

Turkey was one of the first countries to recognize Armenia's independence in 1991. Despite this, for most of the 20th century and early 21st century, relations remain tense and there are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries for numerous reasons. Some bones of contention include the unresolved Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan (which has resulted in Turkey imposing a blockade on Armenia that is still in effect today), the treatment of Armenians in Turkey, the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, and the Armenian claim of Turkey's holding of historic Armenian lands{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}{{dubious|date=June 2015}} (ceded to them in the [[Treaty of Kars]], a treaty which Armenia refuses to recognize to this day since it was signed between the Soviet Union and Turkey, and not between Armenia and Turkey proper). At the forefront of all disputes, however, is the issue surrounding the Armenian Genocide. The killing and deportation of between one and one-and-a-half million Armenians from the [[Ottoman Empire]] orchestrated by the [[Young Turks]] is a taboo subject in Turkey itself as the Turkish government refuses to acknowledge that a genocide ever happened. However, since Turkey has become a candidate to join the European Union, limited discussion of the event is now taking place in Turkey. Some in the European Parliament have even suggested that one of the provisions for Turkey to join the E.U. should be the full recognition of the event as genocide.

On 5 June 2005, Armenian President Robert Kocharian announced that he was ready to &quot;continue dialogue with Azerbaijan for the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and with Turkey on establishing relations without any preconditions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/news/eng/?nid=18307 |title=Yerevan Ready to Continue Dialogue with Baku for Karabakh Settlement |publisher=PanArmenian.net |date=5 June 2006 |access-date=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armenia has also stated that as a legal successor to the [[Armenian SSR]], it is loyal to the Treaty of Kars and all agreements inherited by the former Soviet Armenian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Turkey continues to lay preconditions on relations, insisting that Armenia abandon its efforts to have the Genocide recognized, which official [[Yerevan]] is not willing to do.

In the wake of the [[2008 South Ossetia war]] between Russia and Georgia, Armenia and Turkey have shown signs of an inclination to reconsider their relationship. According to ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine, 70% of Armenia's imports enter via Georgia. Because of the apparently belligerent posture of the Russian state, economic ties with Turkey appear especially attractive.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Turkey and Armenia; Friends and Neighbors, rising hopes of better relations between two historic enemies&quot;, ''The Economist'', 27 September 2008, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that around 70,000 Armenians live in Turkey today, down from nearly 2 million before the start of the Armenian Genocide in 1914. See [[Armenians in Turkey]].

Greece was one of the first countries to recognize Armenia's independence on 21 September 1991, and one of those that have officially recognized the Armenian Genocide. Since the independence of Armenia the two countries have been partners within the framework of international organizations (United Nations, OSCE, Council of Europe, BSEC), whilst Greece firmly supports the community programs aimed at further developing relations between the EU and Armenia.

Continuous visits of the highest level have shown that both countries want to continue to improve the levels of friendship and cooperation (Visit by the President of Armenia Levon Ter-Petrossian to Greece in 1996, visit by the President of the Hellenic Republic Costis Stephanopoulos in 1999, visit by the President of Armenia Robert Kocharyan to Greece in 2000 and 2005 and visit by Greek president [[Karolos Papoulias]] to Armenia in June 2007).

Greece is, after Russia, the major military partner of Armenia. Armenian officers are trained in Greek military academies, and various technical assistance is supplied by Greece. Since 2003, an Armenian platoon has been deployed in Kosovo as part of [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]], where they operate as a part of the Greek battalion of KFOR. It is estimated that around 80,000 Armenians live in Greece.

Armenia's most notable recent foreign policy success came with 29 August treaty with Russia on friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance, in which Moscow committed itself to the defense of Armenia should it be attacked by a third party. Russia is the key regional security player, and has proved a valuable historical ally for Armenia. Although it appeared as a response to Aliyev's US trip, the treaty had probably long been under development. However, it is clear from the wider context of Armenian foreign policy that—while Yerevan welcomes the Russian security guarantee—the country does not want to rely exclusively on Moscow, nor to become part of a confrontation between Russian and US-led alliances in the Transcaucasus.

* The two countries maintain collaborative and friendly relations, however the United Kingdom does not recognize the [[Armenian Genocide]], as it considers that the evidence is not clear enough to respectively consider &quot;the terrible events that afflicted the Ottoman Armenian population at the beginning of the last century&quot; genocide under the 1948 UN convention. The British government states the &quot;massacres were an appalling tragedy&quot; and states that this was the view of the government during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page13999 |title=armeniangenocide – epetition response |date=6 December 2007 |publisher=number10.gov.uk |accessdate=8 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402040200/http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page13999 |archivedate=2 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] consider it to be a genocide, and there is a memorial in Cardiff, Wales.

* The first Armenians migrated to Australia in the 1850s, during the gold rush.
* The majority came to Australia in the 1960s, starting with the Armenians of Egypt after Nasser came to power then, in the early 1970s, from Cyprus after the Turkish occupation of the island and from 1975 until 1992, a period of civil unrest in Lebanon.
* Person-to-person governmental links are increasing although they are still modest. In September 2003, The Hon Mr Philip Ruddock MP visited Armenia in his former capacity as Australian Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. In October 2005, the Armenian Foreign Minister, H.E. Mr [[Vardan Oskanyan]], visited Australia. In November 2005, The Hon Mr Joe Hockey MP, Minister for Human Services, visited Armenia.
* The Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia refuses to recognise the mass murder of Armenians in 1915 as Genocide, although the State of [[New South Wales]] and [[South Australia]] passed a law recognising the Armenian Genocide. The Australian Government elections of 2007 created an atmosphere in which the Opposition Labor party declared it will push for the Recognition of the Armenian Genocide in Australian Parliament if Labor wins the Elections.
* There are around 60,000 Armenians in Australia.
