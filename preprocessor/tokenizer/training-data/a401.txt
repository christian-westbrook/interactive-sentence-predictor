Armenia and Azerbaijan do not have diplomatic relations today.
|See [[Armenia–Azerbaijan relations]], [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]

The neighboring nations of Armenia and Azerbaijan have had formal governmental relations between 1918–1921, when both countries were briefly independent. The two nations have fought two wars in [[Armenian–Azerbaijani War|1918–20 (Armenian–Azerbaijani War)]] and in [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|1988–94 (Nagorno-Karabakh War)]], in the past century, with last one ended with provisional [[Bishkek Protocol|cease fire agreement signed in Bishkek]]. There are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries, because of the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and dispute. In 2008, Azerbaijani president [[Ilham Aliyev]] declared, &quot;Nagorno Karabakh will never be independent; the position is backed by international mediators as well; Armenia has to accept the reality,&quot; and &quot;in 1918, [[Yerevan]] was granted to the [[Armenians]]. It was a great mistake. The [[Erivan khanate|khanate of Iravan]] was the [[Azeris|Azeri]] territory, the Armenians were guests here.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regnum.ru/english/943595.html Azerbaijani president: Armenians are guests in Yerevan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612043901/http://www.regnum.ru/english/943595.html |date=12 June 2009 }}, ''[[REGNUM News Agency]]'', 17 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Soviet period, many Armenians and Azeris lived side by side in peace. However, when [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] introduced the policies of [[Glasnost]] and [[Perestroika]], the majority of Armenians from the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] (NKAO) of the [[Azerbaijan SSR]] began a movement to unify with the [[Armenian SSR]]. In 1988, the Armenians of Karabakh voted to secede and join Armenia. This, along with mutual massacres in Azerbaijan and Armenia resulted in the conflict that became known as the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. The violence resulted in ''de facto'' Armenian control of former NKAO and seven surrounding Azerbaijani regions, which was effectively halted when both sides agrees to observe a cease-fire, which has since been in effect since May 1994, and in late 1995 both also agreed to mediation of the [[OSCE Minsk Group]]. The Minsk Group is currently co-chaired by the U.S., France, and Russia and comprises Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and several Western European nations. Despite the cease fire, up to 40 clashes are reported along the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict lines of control each year.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The two countries are still technically at war. Citizens of the Republic of Armenia, as well as citizens of any other country who are of [[Armenian diaspora|Armenian descent]], are forbidden entry to the Republic of Azerbaijan.

If a person's passport shows any evidence of travel to Nagorno-Karabakh, they are forbidden entry to the Republic of Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsj.org/Azerbaijan.shtml Azerbaijan Country Page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308021931/http://www.ncsj.org/Azerbaijan.shtml |date=8 March 2009 }}.

In 2008, in what became known as the [[2008 Mardakert Skirmishes]], Armenia and Azerbaijan clashed over Nagorno-Karabakh. The fighting between the two sides was brief, with few casualties on either side.&lt;ref name=&quot;regnum.ru&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.regnum.ru/english/943595.html |title=Azerbaijani president: Armenians are guests in Yerevan |agency=[[REGNUM News Agency]] |date=17 January 2008 |accessdate=21 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612043901/http://www.regnum.ru/english/943595.html |archivedate=12 June 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azerbaijan formally recognizes the government of the Republic of Cyprus, as the sole representative of the island, but has not yet established diplomatic relations with Cyprus.
Azerbaijan, like all other countries except Turkey, formally recognizes the government of the Republic of Cyprus (with whom it has not yet established diplomatic relations), which under UN and EU law represents the entire island, but interestingly enough, the parliament of Azerbaijan's [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]] issued a resolution recognizing the Turkish Cypriot North (The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus) as a sovereign state. While this recognition is not regarded by Azerbaijan and internationally as 'official state-to-state', Azerbaijan itself maintained cordial unofficial relations with the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|TRNC]]. In 2004, Azerbaijan threatened to formally recognize the TRNC if the [[Annan Plan for Cyprus|Annan Plan]] was voted down by the Greek Cypriots (who rejected the plan in one of twin referendums held 24 April 2004 in both the Greek and Turkish zones simultaneously), but Azerbaijan backed off the threat when it was pointed out by Cyprus that doing so would be hypocritical, as a portion of its territory just like that of Cyprus itself is under occupation and would probably result in negative impact on its ongoing dispute with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh. Recently, in July 2005, Azerbaijan announced its intentions to recognize TRNC passports and to commence direct flights from Baku to Ercan Airport in the TRNC (by-passing both Turkey and the Republic of Cyprus); however, aside from a flight handled by the private company [[Imair]] in August 2005, none have taken place. Azerbaijan has become very cool towards the Turkish Cypriot North, due to tensions arising from the possible normalization of diplomatic ties between Turkey and Armenia, which Azerbaijan fears will mean the loss of key leverage in the resolution of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkishpolicy.com/images/stories/2005-04-neighbors/TPQ2005-4-ismailzade.pdf Turkey and Azerbaijan: The Honeymoon is Over] by Fariz Ismailzade.

Turkey has been a staunch supporter of Azerbaijan in its efforts to consolidate its independence, preserve its territorial integrity and realize its economic potential arising from the rich natural resources of the [[Caspian Sea]]. All this however has recently come under threat due to tensions arising from the possible normalization of diplomatic ties between Turkey and Armenia, which Azerbaijan fears will mean the loss of key leverage in the resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.

==Disputes==

===Nagorno-Karabakh/Armenia===
{{see also|Nagorno-Karabakh conflict}}
The frozen conflict over currently largely Armenian-populated region of Nagorno-Karabakh within the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]] began when in 1988 the Armenian majority of Nagorno-Karabakh demanded autonomy with demonstrations and persecutions against ethnic Azeris following in Armenia. This led to [[Sumgait pogrom|anti-Armenian rioting]] in Azerbaijan, with Azerbaijani militias beginning their effort to expel Armenians from the enclave. In 1992 a war broke out and [[pogrom]]s of Armenians and Azeris forced both groups to flee their homes. In 1994, a Russian-brokered ceasefire ended the war but more than 1 million ethnic Armenians and Azeris are still not able to return home. The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh remains unresolved despite negotiations, that are ongoing since 1992 under the aegis of the Minsk Group of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], to resolve the conflict peacefully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fighting Intensifies in Armenian-Azerbaijani War|work=[[The New York Times]]|page=10|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/25/world/fighting-intensifies-in-armenian-azerbaijani-war.html|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2013/02/20/armenia_and_azerbaijan_still_skirting_war_in_nagornokarabakh.html Armenia and Azerbaijan still skirting war in Nagorno-Karabakh]. thestar.com. 20 February 2013.

===Caviar diplomacy===
The [[European Stability Initiative]] (ESI) has revealed in a report from 2012 with the title &quot;Caviar Diplomacy: How Azerbaijan silenced the Council of Europe&quot;, that since Azerbaijan's entry into the [[Council of Europe]], each year 30 to 40 deputies are invited to Azerbaijan and generously paid with expensive gifts, including [[caviar]] (worth up to 1.400 euro), silk carpets, gold, silver and large amounts of money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/aserbaidschan-die-kaviar-diplomatie/7280930.html Aserbaidschan: Die Kaviar-Diplomatie] (German).

ESI also published a report on 2013 Presidential elections in Azerbaijan titled &quot;Disgraced: Azerbaijan and the end of election monitoring as we know it&quot;. The report revealed the ties between Azerbaijani government and the members of certain observation missions who praised the elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esiweb.org/pdf/esi_document_id_145.pdf &quot;Disgraced. Azerbaijan and the end of election monitoring as we know it.&quot; 5 November 2013, Berlin]&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijan's &quot;Caviar diplomacy&quot; at 2013 presidential elections sparked a major international scandal, as the reports of two authoritative organizations [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]]/[[European Parliament]] and [[Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights|OSCE/ODIHR]] completely contradicted one another in their assessments of elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/shadowy-western-observers-election-azerbaijan-aliyev/25132176.html|title=Who Are The Shadowy Western Observers Weighing In On Azerbaijan's Election?|work=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Regions-and-countries/Azerbaijan/Europe-Azerbaijan-and-caviar-144030|title=Europe, Azerbaijan, and caviar|author=[[Osservatorio Balcani e Caucaso]]|work=[[Osservatorio Balcani e Caucaso]]|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24573024 European MPs' praise for Azerbaijan election sparks row] BBC News, 17 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/24/azerbaijan-caviar-diplomacy-for-mps ''Plush hotels and caviar diplomacy: how Azerbaijan's elite wooed MPs''] The Guardian 24 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

At june 2016 the public prosecutor of Milan has accused the former leader of the (Christian) Union of the Center and of the European People's Party of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe Luca Volonte of accepting large bribes from representatives of the Azerbaijani government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2016/06/25/corruzione-tangente-da-due-milioni-dallazerbaijan-indagato-a-milano-ex-udc-volonte/2859414/ Corruzione, “tangente da due milioni dall’Azerbaijan”: indagato a Milano ex Udc Volontè] // Corriere della Sera, 25 june 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Two people with high-level experience of the Council of Europe’s parliamentary assembly (Pace) have told the Guardian they believe its members have been offered bribes for votes by Azerbaijan. Former Azerbaijani diplomat, Arif Mammadov, alleged that a member of Azerbaijan's delegation at the Council of Europe had €30m (£25m) to spend on lobbying its institutions, including the Council of Europe assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/apr/20/council-of-europe-urged-to-investigate-azerbaijan-bribery-allegations Fresh claims of Azerbaijan vote-rigging at European human rights body] // The Guardian. 20 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; PACE ratified the terms of reference of an independent external investigation body to carry out a detailed independent inquiry into the allegations of corruption at the council involving Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40092451 Corruption inquiry at Council of Europe over Azerbaijan] // BBC, 30 may 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ESISC  report ====
On 6 March 2017, ESISC (European Strategic Intelligence and Security Center) published a scandalous report called “The Armenian Connection” where it veraciously attacked human rights NGOs and research organisations criticising human rights violations and corruption in Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;FFAC&quot;&gt;[https://civicsolidarity.org/sites/default/files/az_lobbying_corruption_report_10_march_2017_public_version_color_1.pdf AN EXPLORATION INTO AZERBAIJAN’S SOPHISTICATED SYSTEM OF PROJECTING ITS INTERNATIONAL INFLUENCE, BUYING WESTERN POLITICIANS AND CAPTURING INTERGOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS] // Freedom Files Analytical Centre (Civic Solidarity Platform), March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

ESISC in that report asserted that &quot;Caviar diplomacy&quot; report elaborated by ESI aimed to create climate of suspicion based on slander to form a network of MPs that would engage in a political war against Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esisc.org/publications/analyses/11791|title=The Armenian Connection: How a secret caucus of MPs and NGOs, since 2012, created a network within the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe to hide violations of international law|website=www.esisc.org|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Second Chapter of the report called &quot;The Armenian Connection: «Mr X», Nils Muižnieks, Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights&quot; that was published on 18 April 2017 ESISC asserted that the network composed of European PMs, Armenian officials and some NGOs: [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Amnesty International]], &quot;Human Rights House Foundation&quot;, &quot;Open Dialog, [[European Stability Initiative]], and [[Helsinki Committee for Human Rights]] , was financed by the [[Soros Foundation]]. According to ESISC the key figure of the network since 2012  has been [[Nils Muižnieks]], Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe and  the network has served to the interests of George Soros and the Republic of Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esisc.org/publications/analyses/the-armenian-connection-chapter-2--mr-x--nils-muinieks-council-of-europe-commissioner-for-human-rights|title=The Armenian Connection. Chapter 2: &quot; Mr X &quot;, Nils Muižnieks, Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights|website=www.esisc.org|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;The report is written in the worst traditions of authoritarian propaganda, makes absurd claims, and is clearly aimed at deflecting the wave of criticism against cover-up of unethical lobbying and corruption in PACE and demands for change in the Assembly&quot;, said Freedom Files Analytical Centre.&lt;ref name=&quot;FFAC&quot; /&gt;

According Robert Coalson (Radio Free Europe), ESISC is a part of Baku's lobbying efforts to extend to the use of front think tanks to shift public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rferl.org/a/azerbaijan-baku-caviar-oil/25162410.html Baku Smooths Over Its Rights Record With A Thick Layer Of Caviar] // Radio Free Europe, November 08, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

European Stability Initiative said that &quot;ESISC report is full of lies (such as claiming that German PACE member Strasser holds pro-Armenian views and citing as evidence that he went to Yerevan in 2015 to commemorate the Armenian genocide, when Strasser has never in his life been to independent Armenia)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esiweb.org/index.php?lang=fr&amp;id=67&amp;newsletter_ID=114 Merchants of Doubt or investigating Corruption] // ESI, 21 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
