'''Alexander I''' ([[Middle Irish language|medieval Gaelic]]: ''Alaxandair mac Maíl Coluim''; [[Scottish Gaelic language|modern Gaelic]]: ''Alasdair mac Mhaol Chaluim''; c. 1078 – 23 April 1124), posthumously nicknamed '''The Fierce''',&lt;ref&gt;This nickname however is not attested for another three centuries, in the work of [[Andrew of Wyntoun]].&lt;/ref&gt; was the [[King of Scotland]] from 1107 to his death.

==Life==
Alexander was the fifth son of [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm III]] by his wife [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret of Wessex]], grandniece of [[Edward the Confessor]]. Alexander was named after [[Pope Alexander II]].

He was the younger brother of King [[Edgar of Scotland|Edgar]], who was unmarried, and his brother's [[heir presumptive]] by 1104 (and perhaps earlier). In that year he was the senior layman present at the examination of the remains of [[Saint Cuthbert]] at [[Durham, England|Durham]] prior to their re-interment. He held lands in Scotland north of the [[River Forth|Forth]] and in [[Lothian]].&lt;ref name = &quot;ystlxt&quot;&gt;Barrow, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the death of Edgar in 1107 he succeeded to the Scottish crown; but, in accordance with Edgar's instructions, their brother [[David I of Scotland|David]] was granted an [[appanage]] in southern Scotland. Edgar's will granted David the lands of the former [[kingdom of Strathclyde]] or Cumbria, and this was apparently agreed in advance by Edgar, Alexander, David and their brother-in-law [[Henry I of England]]. In 1113, perhaps at Henry's instigation, and with the support of his [[Anglo-Norman]] allies, David demanded, and received, additional lands in [[Lothian]] along the Upper [[River Tweed|Tweed]] and [[River Teviot|Teviot]]. David did not receive the title of king, but of &quot;prince of the Cumbrians&quot;, and his lands remained under Alexander's final authority.&lt;ref&gt;Oram, pp. 60–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dispute over Tweeddale and Teviotdale does not appear to have damaged relations between Alexander and David, although it was unpopular in some quarters. A [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] poem laments:&lt;blockquote&gt;It's bad what Malcolm's son has done,&lt;br&gt;dividing us from Alexander;&lt;br&gt;he causes, like each king's son before,&lt;br&gt;the plunder of stable Alba.&lt;ref&gt;Oram, p. 66 citing [[Thomas Owen Clancy|Clancy]], ''The Triumph Tree''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The dispute over the eastern marches does not appear to have caused lasting trouble between Alexander and Henry of England. In 1114 he joined Henry on campaign in Wales against [[Gruffudd ap Cynan]] of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]].&lt;ref&gt;Oram, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander's marriage with Henry's illegitimate daughter [[Sybilla of Normandy]] may have occurred as early as 1107, or as at late as 1114.&lt;ref&gt;Oram, p. 65; a date around 1114 would place the marriage at about the same time as that of David and [[Maud, 2nd Countess of Huntingdon|Maud of Huntingdon]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William of Malmesbury]]'s account attacks Sybilla, but the evidence argues that Alexander and Sybilla were a devoted but childless couple and Sybilla was of noteworthy piety.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, p. 65; Oram, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Sybilla died in unrecorded circumstances at ''Eilean nam Ban'' ([[Kenmore, Perth and Kinross|Kenmore]] on [[Loch Tay]]) in July 1122 and was buried at [[Dunfermline Abbey]]. Alexander did not remarry and [[Walter Bower]] wrote that he planned an [[Augustinian]] [[Priory]] at the ''Eilean nam Ban'' dedicated to Sybilla's memory, and he may have taken steps to have her [[Veneration|venerated]].&lt;ref&gt;Oram, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alexander I (Alba) ii.JPG|thumb|250px|The reverse of the [[seal (device)|seal]] of Alexander I, enhanced as a 19th-century steel engraving.]]
Alexander had at least one illegitimate child, [[Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair]], who was later to be involved in a revolt against [[David I of Scotland|David I]] in the 1130s. He was imprisoned at [[Roxburgh]] for many years afterwards, perhaps until his death some time after 1157.&lt;ref&gt;Oram, p. 77. The identity of this person may be still in question, see [[Meic Uilleim]] and [[MacHeths]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander was, like his brothers Edgar and David, a notably pious king. He was responsible for foundations at [[Scone, Perthshire|Scone]] and [[Inchcolm]]. His mother's chaplain and [[hagiography|hagiographer]] [[Thurgot]] was named [[Bishop of Saint Andrews]] (or ''Cell Rígmonaid'') in 1107, presumably by Alexander's order.&lt;ref name = &quot;ystlxt&quot;/&gt; The case of Thurgot's would-be successor [[Eadmer]] shows that Alexander's wishes were not always accepted by the religious community, perhaps because Eadmer had the backing of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Ralph d'Escures]], rather than [[Thurstan]] of [[Archbishop of York|York]]. Alexander also patronised [[Saint Andrews]], granting lands intended for an Augustinian Priory, which may have been the same as that intended to honour his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Barrow, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

For all his religiosity, Alexander was not remembered as a man of peace. [[John of Fordun]] says of him:
{{quote|Now the king was a lettered and godly man; very humble and amiable towards the clerics and regulars, but terrible beyond measure to the rest of his subjects; a man of large heart, exerting himself in all things beyond his strength.&lt;ref&gt;Fordun, V, xxviii ([[William Forbes Skene|Skene's]] edition).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He manifested the terrible aspect of his character in his reprisals in the [[Mormaerdom of Moray]]. [[Andrew of Wyntoun]]'s ''Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland'' says that Alexander was holding court at [[Invergowrie]] when he was attacked by &quot;men of the Isles&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wyntoun, cxxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Bower says the attackers were from Moray and Mearns. Alexander pursued them north, to &quot;Stockford&quot; in [[Ross]] (near [[Beauly]]) where he defeated them. This, says Wyntoun, is why he was named the &quot;Fierce&quot;. The dating of this is uncertain, as are his enemies' identity. However, in 1116 the [[Annals of Ulster]] report: &quot;Ladhmann son of Domnall, grandson of the king of Scotland, was killed by the men of Moray.&quot; The king referred to is Alexander's father, Malcolm III, and Domnall was Alexander's half brother. The Mormaerdom or Kingdom of Moray was ruled by the family of [[Macbeth of Scotland|Macbeth]] (Mac Bethad mac Findláich) and [[Lulach of Scotland|Lulach]] (Lulach mac Gille Coemgáin): not overmighty subjects, but a family who had ruled Alba within little more than a lifetime. Who the Mormaer or King was at this time is not known; it may have been [[Óengus of Moray]] or his father, whose name is not known. As for the Mearns, the only known [[Mormaer of Mearns]], [[Máel Petair of Mearns|Máel Petair]], had murdered Alexander's half-brother [[Duncan II of Scotland|Duncan II]] (Donnchad mac Maíl Coluim) in 1094.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, pp. 23–24, deals with this affair.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander died in April 1124 at his court at Stirling; his brother David, probably the acknowledged heir since the death of Sybilla, succeeded him.&lt;ref&gt;Oram, pp.71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional portrayals==

Alexander I has been depicted in a fantasy novel.:&lt;ref name=&quot;Saint Andrews&quot;&gt;Saint Andrews, Brodrick (2010), p. 99-104&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Pater Nostras Canis Dirus: The Garrison Effect'' (2010). Alexander is depicted troubled by his lack of direct heirs, having no child with his wife [[Sybilla of Normandy]]. He points that his father-in-law [[Henry I of England]] is asking them for a grandson.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saint Andrews&quot;/&gt;
