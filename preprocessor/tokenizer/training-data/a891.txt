In this [[numeral system]], a sequence of digits such as &quot;975&quot; is read as a single number, using the position of the digit in the sequence to interpret its value. It was originally developed by ancient [[Indian mathematics|mathematicians in the Indian subcontinent]] around AD 500.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cengage Learning&quot;/&gt;

The system was adopted by [[Arabic mathematics|Arabic mathematicians]] in [[Baghdad]] and passed on to the Arabs farther west. There is some evidence to suggest that the numerals in their current form developed from [[Abjad numerals|Arabic letters]] in the [[Maghreb]], the western region of the [[Arab world]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://xxx.lanl.gov/ftp/math/papers/0304/0304219.pdf On the Origin of Arabic Numerals] - A. Boucenna - [[Université Ferhat Abbas]] [[Setif]] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current form of the numerals developed in North Africa, distinct in form from the Indian and [[Eastern Arabic numerals]]. It was in the North African city of [[Bejaia]] that the [[Italian people|Italian]] scholar [[Fibonacci]] first encountered the numerals; his work was crucial in making them known throughout Europe and then further to the Europeans who spread it worldwide. The use of Arabic numerals spread around the world through European trade, books and [[colonialism]].

The term ''Arabic numerals'' is ambiguous. It most commonly refers to the numerals widely used in Europe and the Americas; to avoid confusion, [[Unicode]] calls these ''European digits''. ''Arabic numerals'' is also the conventional name for the entire family of related numerals of Arabic and [[Indian numerals]]. It may also be intended to mean the numerals used by Arabs, in which case it generally refers to the Eastern Arabic numerals. It would be more appropriate to refer to the ''Arabic numeral system'', where the value of a digit in a number depends on its position.

Although the phrase &quot;Arabic numeral&quot; is frequently capitalized, it is sometimes written in lower case: for instance, in its entry in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'',&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Arabic&quot;, ''Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd edition&lt;/ref&gt; which helps to distinguish it from &quot;Arabic numerals&quot; as the East Arabic numerals specific to the Arabs.

==History==

===Origins===

{{Main|History of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system}}

The decimal Hindu–Arabic numeral system was developed in India by around AD 700.&lt;ref name=oconnor&gt;O'Connor, J. J. and E. F. Robertson. 2000.  [http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Indian_numerals.html Indian Numerals], ''MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive'', School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St. Andrews, Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt; The development was gradual, spanning several centuries, but the decisive step was probably provided by [[Brahmagupta]]'s formulation of [[zero]] as a number in AD 628. The system was revolutionary by including zero in [[positional notation]], thereby limiting the number of individual digits to ten. It is considered an important milestone in the development of mathematics. One may distinguish between this positional ''system'', which is identical throughout the family, and the precise [[glyph]]s used to write the numerals, which varied regionally.

The glyphs most commonly used in conjunction with the [[Latin script]] since [[Early modern period|early modern times]] are &lt;big&gt;[[0 (number)|0]] [[1 (number)|1]] [[2 (number)|2]] [[3 (number)|3]] [[4 (number)|4]] [[5 (number)|5]] [[6 (number)|6]] [[7 (number)|7]] [[8 (number)|8]] [[9 (number)|9]]&lt;/big&gt;.
The first universally accepted inscription containing the use of the 0 glyph in India is first recorded in the 9th century, in an inscription at [[Gwalior]] in [[Central India]] dated to 870. Numerous Indian documents on [[Indian copper plate inscriptions|copper plates]] exist, with the same symbol for zero in them, dated back as far as the 6th century AD, but their dates are uncertain. Inscriptions in [[Indonesia]] and [[Cambodia]] dating to AD 683 have also been found.{{sfn|Plofker|2009|p=45}}

[[File:Indian numerals 100AD.svg|frame|right|[[Brahmi numeral]]s (lower row) in India in the 1st century AD]]
[[File:Bakhshali numerals 2.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The numerals used in the [[Bakhshali manuscript]], dated to sometime between the 3rd and 7th century AD.]]
[[File:EgyptphoneKeypad.jpg|right|thumb|Modern-day Arab telephone keypad with two forms of Arabic numerals: Western Arabic/European numerals on the left and [[Eastern Arabic numerals]] on the right]]

The [[numeral system]] came to be known to both the [[Persian people|Persian]] mathematician [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|Al-Khwarizmi]], whose book ''On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals'' was written about 825 in [[Arabic]], and the [[Arab]] mathematician [[Al-Kindi]], who wrote four volumes, ''On the Use of the Indian Numerals'' (''Ketab fi Isti'mal al-'Adad al-Hindi'') about 830. Their work was principally responsible for the diffusion of the Indian system of numeration in the Middle East and the West.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/HistTopics/Indian_numerals.html The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 10th century, [[Middle-East]]ern mathematicians extended the decimal numeral system to include [[fractions]], as recorded in a treatise by [[Syrian]] mathematician [[Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi]] in 952–953. The [[decimal point]] notation was introduced by [[Sind ibn Ali]], who also wrote the earliest treatise on Arabic numerals.

A distinctive West Arabic variant of the symbols begins to emerge around the 10th century in the [[Maghreb]] and [[Al-Andalus]], called ''ghubar'' (&quot;sand-table&quot; or &quot;dust-table&quot;) numerals, which are the direct ancestor of the modern Western Arabic numerals used throughout the world. Ghubar numerals themselves are probably of Roman origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Origin of the Ghubār Numerals, or the Arabian Abacus and the Articuli|first=Solomon|last=Gandz|journal=[[Isis (Journal)|Isis]]|volume=16|issue=2|date=November 1931|pages=393–424|doi=10.1086/346615|JSTOR=224714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Popular myths====
Some popular myths have argued that the original forms of these symbols indicated their numeric value through the number of angles they contained, but no evidence exists of any such origin.&lt;ref name=ifrah&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ifrah|first1=Georges|title=The universal history of numbers: from prehistory to the invention of the computer; translated from the French by David Bellos|date=1998|publisher=Harvill Press|location=London|isbn=9781860463242|pages=356–357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adoption in Europe===

[[File:Ms.Thott.290.2º 150v.jpg|thumb|A German manuscript page teaching use of Arabic numerals ([[Hans Talhoffer|Talhoffer]] Thott, 1459). At this time, knowledge of the numerals was still widely seen as esoteric, and Talhoffer presents them with the [[Hebrew alphabet]] and [[astrology]].]]
[[File:Clock-french-republic.jpg|thumb|right|Late 18th-century French revolutionary &quot;decimal&quot; clockface.]]

In 825 [[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī|Al-Khwārizmī]] wrote a treatise in Arabic, ''On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DuyMjOwWWnUC&amp;pg=PA38 Philosophy Of Mathematics] Francis, John – 2008 – Page 38&lt;/ref&gt; which survives only as the 12th-century Latin translation, ''Algoritmi de numero Indorum''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=twWkDe1Y9YQC&amp;pg=PT99 The Ellipse: A Historical and Mathematical Journey] Arthur Mazer – 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/317171/al-Khwarizmi Encyclopædia Britannica: al-Khwārizmī]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Algoritmi'', the translator's rendition of the author's name, gave rise to the word ''[[algorithm]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FPFsnzzebhQC&amp;pg=PA1 Models of Computation: An Introduction to Computability Theory – Page 1] Maribel Fernández – 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mentions of the numerals in the West are found in the ''[[Codex Vigilanus]]'' of 976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathorigins.com/V.htm Mathorigins.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 980s, Gerbert of [[Aurillac]] (later, [[Pope Sylvester II]]) used his position to spread knowledge of the numerals in Europe. Gerbert studied in [[Barcelona]] in his youth. He was known to have requested mathematical treatises concerning the [[astrolabe]] from [[Lupitus of Barcelona]] after he had returned to France.

[[Leonardo Fibonacci]] ([[Leonardo of Pisa]]), a mathematician born in the [[Republic of Pisa]] who had studied in [[Béjaïa]] (Bougie), [[Algeria]], promoted the Indian numeral system in Europe with his 1202 book ''[[Liber Abaci]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;When my father, who had been appointed by his country as public notary in the customs at [[Béjaïa|Bugia]] acting for the [[Pisa]]n merchants going there, was in charge, he summoned me to him while I was still a child, and having an eye to usefulness and future convenience, desired me to stay there and receive instruction in the school of accounting. There, when I had been introduced to the art of the Indians' nine symbols through remarkable teaching, knowledge of the art very soon pleased me above all else and I came to understand it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The numerals are arranged with their lowest value digit to the right, with higher value positions added to the left. This arrangement was adopted identically into the numerals as used in Europe. Languages written in the Latin alphabet run from left-to-right, unlike languages written in the Arabic alphabet. Hence, from the point of view of the reader, numerals in Western texts are written with the highest power of the base first whereas numerals in Arabic texts are written with the lowest power of the base first.

The reason the digits are more commonly known as &quot;Arabic numerals&quot; in Europe and the Americas is that they were introduced to Europe in the 10th century by Arabic-speakers of North Africa, who were then using the digits from Libya to Morocco. Arabs, on the other hand, call the system &quot;[[Hindu]] numerals&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;UniOfNthC1&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/roman.html|title=Roman and &quot;Arabic&quot; Numerals|last=Rowlett|first=Russ|date=4 July 2004|publisher=[[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]|accessdate=22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TWPTakeANo&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-909875.html|title=Article: Take a Number, Please.|last=Achenbach|first=Joel|authorlink=Joel Achenbach|date=16 September 1994|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to their origin in India. This is not to be confused with what the Arabs call the &quot;Hindi numerals&quot;, namely the [[Eastern Arabic numerals]] ({{script/Arabic|٠}} - {{script/Arabic|١}} - {{script/Arabic|٢}} - {{script/Arabic|٣}} -{{script/Arabic|٤}} - {{script/Arabic|٥}} - {{script/Arabic|٦}} - {{script/Arabic|٧}} - {{script/Arabic|٨}} - {{script/Arabic|٩}}) used in the Middle East, or any of the numerals currently used in [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] (e.g. [[Devanagari]]: {{lang|sa|०.१.२.३.४.५.६.७.८.९}}).&lt;ref name=ifrah /&gt;

The European acceptance of the numerals was accelerated by the invention of the [[printing press]], and they became widely known during the 15th century. Early evidence of their use in [[Great Britain in the Middle Ages|Britain]] includes: an equal hour horary [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] from 1396,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=14th century timepiece unearthed in Qld farm shed |publisher=ABC News |url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-11-09/one-man27s-trash-is-another27s-centuries-old-treasure/3654974}}&lt;/ref&gt; in England, a 1445 inscription on the tower of [[Heathfield and Waldron|Heathfield]] Church, [[Sussex]]; a 1448 inscription on a wooden lych-gate of [[Bray, Berkshire|Bray]] Church, [[Berkshire]]; and a 1487 inscription on the belfry door at [[Piddletrenthide]] church, [[Dorset]]; and in [[Scotland]] a 1470 inscription on the tomb of the first Earl of Huntly in [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]] Cathedral. (See G.F. Hill, ''The Development of Arabic Numerals in Europe'' for more examples.) In central Europe, the [[King of Hungary]] [[Ladislaus the Posthumous]], started the use of Arabic numerals, which appear for the first time in a royal document of 1456.&lt;ref&gt;Erdélyi: Magyar művelődéstörténet 1-2. kötet. Kolozsvár, 1913, 1918&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-16th century, they were in common use in most of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/52545.html Mathforum.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Roman numerals]] remained in use mostly for the notation of [[Anno Domini]] years, and for numbers on clockfaces.

Today, Roman numerals are still used for enumeration of lists (as an alternative to alphabetical enumeration), for sequential volumes, to differentiate monarchs or family members with the same first names, and (in lower case) to number pages in prefatory material in books.

===Adoption in Russia===
[[Cyrillic numerals]] were a numbering system derived from the [[Early Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic alphabet]], used by [[South Slavs|South]] and [[East Slavs|East]] [[Slavic peoples]]. The system was used in Russia as late as the early 18th century when [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] replaced it with Arabic numerals.

===Adoption in China===
[[File:Yuan dynasty iron magic square.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Iron plate with an order 6 [[magic square]] in Persian/ Arabic numbers from China, dating to the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1271–1368).]]

Arabic numerals were introduced to China during the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) by the Muslim [[Hui people]]. In the early 17th century, European-style Arabic numerals were introduced by Spanish and Portuguese Jesuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Helaine Selin|editor-link=Helaine Selin|title=Encyclopaedia of the history of science, technology, and medicine in non-western cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raKRY3KQspsC&amp;pg=PA198|accessdate=3 March 2012|date=31 July 1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-4066-9|pages=198–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meuleman|first=Johan H.|title=Islam in the era of globalization: Muslim attitudes towards modernity and identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YNArhqy4emwC&amp;pg=PA272|accessdate=3 March 2012|date=23 August 2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7007-1691-3|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peng Yoke Ho|title=Li, Qi and Shu: An Introduction to Science and Civilization in China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_P6C4JO4JCUC&amp;pg=PA106|accessdate=3 March 2012|date=16 October 2000|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-41445-4|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of symbols==
{{main|Algorism}}

The numeral system employed, known as [[algorism]], is [[positional notation|positional]] [[decimal]] notation. Various symbol sets are used to represent numbers in the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, which may have evolved from the [[Brahmi numerals]], or developed independently from it. The symbols used to represent the system have split into various typographical variants since the [[Middle Ages]]:

*The widespread Western Arabic numerals used with the [[Latin script]], in the table below labelled ''European'', descended from the West Arabic numerals developed in [[al-Andalus]] (Andalucía, Spain) and the [[Maghreb]]. Spanish scholars because of the geographic proximity, trade and constant warfare with the Muslim kingdoms of Southern Spain saw a potential in the simplicity of Arabic numbers, and decided to adopt those symbols, later other Europeans followed and incorporated them too. (There are two [[typographic]] styles for rendering European numerals, known as lining figures and [[text figures]]).
*The Arabic–Indic or [[Eastern Arabic numerals]], used with the [[Arabic script]], developed primarily in what is now [[Iraq]]. A variant of the Eastern Arabic numerals used in the Persian and Urdu languages is shown as East Arabic-Indic.
*The [[Devanagari numerals]] used with [[Devanagari]] and related variants are grouped as [[Indian numerals]].

The evolution of the numerals in early Europe is shown on a table created by the French scholar [[Jean-Étienne Montucla]] in his ''Histoire de la Mathematique'', which was published in 1757:

[[File:EuropeanFormOfArabianDigits.png|500px|Table of numerals]]
[[File:Apices du moyen-âge.PNG|500px]]

The Arabic numeral glyphs 0–9 are encoded in [[ASCII]] and [[Unicode]] at positions 0x30 to 0x39, matching up with the second [[hexadecimal]] digit for convenience:
