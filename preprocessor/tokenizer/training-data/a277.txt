== Early life ==
Anna Kournikova was born in Moscow, Russia, on 7 June 1981. Her father, Sergei Kournikov (born 1961),&lt;ref name=&quot;community.kournikova.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.kournikova.com/showthread.php?t=32375 |title=Anna's official discussion forum |publisher=Community.kournikova.com |accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a former [[Greco-Roman wrestling]] champion, eventually earned a PhD and was a professor at the University of Physical Culture and Sport in Moscow. As of 2001, he was still a part-time martial arts instructor there. Her mother Alla (born 1963) had been a [[400 metres|400-metre runner]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sportsmates.com&quot;/&gt; Her younger brother, [[Allan Kournikova|Allan]], is a youth golf world champion who was featured in the 2013 documentary film ''[[The Short Game]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pga.com/news/golf-buzz/anna-kournikova-little-brother-allan-blossoming-golf-champion|title=Anna Kournikova's Little Brother is a Blossoming Golf Champion|author=Holmes, John|publisher=[[Professional Golfers Association]]|accessdate=2014-06-22|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sergei Kournikov has said, &quot;We were young and we liked the clean, physical life, so Anna was in a good environment for sport from the beginning&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;sportsmates.com&quot;/&gt;

Kournikova received her first tennis [[racquet]] as a New Year gift in 1986 at age 5. Describing her early regimen, she said, &quot;I played two times a week from age six. It was a children's program. And it was just for fun; my parents didn't know I was going to play professionally, they just wanted me to do something because I had lots of energy. It was only when I started playing well at seven that I went to a professional academy. I would go to school, and then my parents would take me to the club, and I'd spend the rest of the day there just having fun with the kids.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sportsmates.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsmates.com/index.php?cmd=view_gallery&amp;gal_id=380&amp;image_id=5975&amp;page=1&amp;club_id=2461 |title=About Anna Kournikova |publisher=Sportsmates |date=12 May 2008 |accessdate=10 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206065346/http://www.sportsmates.com/index.php?cmd=view_gallery&amp;gal_id=380&amp;image_id=5975&amp;page=1&amp;club_id=2461 |archivedate=6 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Kournikova became a member of the [[Spartak Tennis Club]], coached by Larissa Preobrazhenskaya.&lt;ref name=&quot;kournikova.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kournikova.com/about/bio |title=Official Biography of Anna Kournikova |publisher=Kournikova.com |accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, at the age of eight, Kournikova began appearing in junior tournaments, and by the following year, was attracting attention from tennis scouts across the world. Kournikova signed a management deal at age ten and went to [[Bradenton, Florida|Bradenton]], Florida, to train at [[Nick Bollettieri]]'s celebrated tennis academy.&lt;ref name=&quot;kournikova.com&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Kournikova-SYD-1.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Anna Kournikova|At the [[Medibank International Sydney]] in 2002]]
Kournikova was quite successful in 2002. She reached the semi-finals of [[Auckland]], Tokyo, [[Acapulco]] and San Diego, and the final of the [[China Open (tennis)|China Open]], losing to [[Anna Smashnova]]. This was Kournikova's last singles final. With [[Martina Hingis]], she lost in the final at Sydney, but they won their second [[Grand Slam (tennis)|grand slam]] title together, the [[2002 Australian Open|Australian Open]]. They also lost in the quarterfinals of the [[2002 US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. With [[Chanda Rubin]], Kournikova played the semi-finals of [[2002 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], but they lost to [[Serena Williams|Serena]] and [[Venus Williams]]. Partnering [[Janet Lee]], she won the Shanghai title. At the end of 2002 season, she was ranked No. 35 in singles and No. 11 in doubles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Website - Tennis Stats&quot;/&gt;

In 2003, Anna Kournikova collected her first [[Grand Slam (tennis)|grand slam]] match victory in two years at the [[2003 Australian Open|Australian Open]]. She defeated [[Henrieta Nagyová]] in the 1st round, and then lost to [[Justine Henin-Hardenne]] in the 2nd round. She withdrew from Tokyo due to a sprained back suffered at the Australian Open and did not return to Tour until Miami. On 9 April, in what would be the final WTA match of her career, Kournikova retired in the 1st round of the [[Family Circle Cup]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], due to a left adductor strain. Her singles world ranking was 67. She reached the semi-finals at the [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]] tournament in [[Sea Island, Georgia|Sea Island]], before withdrawing from a match versus [[Maria Sharapova]] due to the adductor injury. She lost in the 1st round of the ITF tournament in Charlottesville. She did not compete for the rest of the season due to a continuing back injury. At the end of the 2003 season and her professional career, she was ranked No. 305 in singles and No. 176 in doubles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Website - Tennis Stats&quot;/&gt;

Kournikova's two [[Grand Slam in tennis|Grand Slam]] doubles titles came in 1999 and 2002, both at the Australian Open in the Women's Doubles event with partner [[Martina Hingis]]. Kournikova proved a successful doubles player on the professional circuit, winning 16 tournament doubles titles, including two Australian Opens and being a finalist in mixed doubles at the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] and at Wimbledon, and reaching the No.&amp;nbsp;1 ranking in doubles in the [[Women's Tennis Association]] tour rankings. Her pro career doubles record was 200–71. However, her singles career plateaued after 1999. For the most part, she managed to retain her ranking between 10 and 15 (her career high singles ranking was No.8), but her expected finals breakthrough failed to occur; she only reached four finals out of 130 singles tournaments, never in a Grand Slam event, and never won one.

Her singles record is 209–129. Her final playing years were marred by a string of injuries, especially back injuries, which caused her ranking to erode gradually. As a personality Kournikova was among the most common search strings for both articles and images in her prime.&lt;ref name=2001EOY/&gt;&lt;ref name=2002EOY/&gt;&lt;ref name=2003EOY/&gt;

=== 2004–present: Exhibitions and World Team Tennis ===

== Personal life ==
Kournikova was in a relationship with fellow Russian [[Pavel Bure]], an [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[ice hockey]] player. The two met in 1999 when Kournikova was still linked to Bure's former Russian teammate [[Sergei Fedorov]].&lt;ref name=arbat&gt;{{cite news |title=People: Courtney Love, Scissor Sisters, Antonio Moral |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/11/arts/11iht-peepsat.html |accessdate=12 July 2009 |date=11 February 2005 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bure and Kournikova were reported to have been engaged in 2000 after a reporter took a photo of them together in a Florida restaurant where Bure supposedly asked Kournikova to marry him. As the story made headlines in Russia, where they were both heavily followed in the media as celebrities, Bure and Kournikova both denied any engagement. Kournikova, 10 years younger than Bure, was 18 years old at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kournikova and Bure wedding may be off |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/kournikova-and-bure-wedding-may-be-off-720494.html |accessdate=24 June 2009 |date=6 April 2000 |work=The Independent |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, Kournikova and Fedorov were married in Moscow.&lt;ref name=arbat/&gt; Fedorov claimed he and Kournikova were married in 2001, and divorced in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marriage&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2003/03/03/fedorov030303.html|title=Fedorov married, divorced Kournikova|accessdate=26 January 2007|publisher=CBC Sports| date=3 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kournikova's representatives deny any marriage to Fedorov; however, Fedorov's agent Pat Brisson claims that although he does not know when they got married, he knew &quot;Fedorov was married&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2003/03/03/fedorov030303.html#ixzz0sP7fSbs3 | work=CBC News | title=Fedorov married, divorced Kournikova | date=3 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kournikova started dating pop star [[Enrique Iglesias]] in late 2001 (she appeared in his video, &quot;Escape&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Corey.

In June 2008, Iglesias was quoted by the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' as having married Kournikova the previous year and subsequently separated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/a104379/iglesias-anna-and-i-were-married.html | title=Iglesias: 'Anna and I were married'| publisher=Digital Spy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple have invested in a $20&amp;nbsp;million home to be built on a private island in Miami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2063342/Anna-Kournikova-pregnant-She-belly-kissed-Enrique-Iglesias.html|title=Tum-ting to tell us Anna?

Most of Kournikova's fame has come from the publicity surrounding her looks and her personal life.  During her debut at the 1996 US Open at the age of 15, the western world noticed her beauty, and soon pictures of her appeared in numerous magazines worldwide.

In 2000, Kournikova became the new face for [[Berlei]]'s shock absorber [[sports bra]]s, and appeared in the &quot;only the ball should bounce&quot; billboard campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anna Kournikova turns 30 |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/sports/gallery/Anna-Kournikova-turns-30-15347/photo-1036579.php|accessdate=11 June 2011 | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following that, she was cast by the [[Farrelly brothers]] for a minor role in the 2000 film ''[[Me, Myself &amp; Irene]]'' starring [[Jim Carrey]] and [[Renée Zellweger]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Farrelly&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://espn.go.com/blog/afceast/post/_/id/26228/farrelly-brothers-talk-athletes-as-actors | title=Farrelly brothers talk athletes as actors |publisher=ESPN | date=23 February 2011 | accessdate=6 March 2012 | author=Graham, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photographs of her have appeared on covers of various publications, including [[List of men's magazines|men's magazines]], such as one in the much-publicized 2004 ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/swimsuit/modelfeatured/anna_kournikova/2004/athletes/index.htm |title = Anna Kournikova SI Swimsuit Collection|publisher=Turner Sports &amp; Entertainment Digital Network|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she posed in bikinis and swimsuits, as well as in ''[[FHM]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;FHM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fhm.com/girls/covergirls/anna-kournikova |title = Anna Kournikova – Courting attention|publisher=Bauer Media|accessdate=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.maxim.com/amg/girls/todays-girl/44929/anna-kournikova.html |title =  Anna Kournikova She's grand slammin'. |publisher=Alpha Media Group|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kournikova was named one of ''[[People (American magazine)|People]]'s'' 50 Most Beautiful People in 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20125205,00.html |title =  Our Fabulous 50 Most Beautiful |work=Time|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was voted &quot;hottest female athlete&quot; on [[ESPN.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=hottest/female/group3 |title =  Page 2's Hottest Female Athlete |publisher=ESPN|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 she also placed first in ''[[FHM]]'s [[FHM's 100 Sexiest Women (UK)|100 Sexiest Women in the World]]'' in US and UK editions.&lt;ref name=&quot;FHM&quot; /&gt; By contrast, [[ESPN]]—citing the degree of hype as compared to actual accomplishments as a singles player—ranked Kournikova 18th in its &quot;25 Biggest Sports Flops of the Past 25 Years&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/espn25/story?page=listranker/25biggestflops | title=Biggest Sports Flop | publisher=ESPN }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kournikova was also ranked No.&amp;nbsp;1 in the ESPN Classic series &quot;Who's number 1?&quot; when the series featured sport's most overrated athletes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMnmcX6GM3g]&lt;/ref&gt;
