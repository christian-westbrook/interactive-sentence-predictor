[[File:OBV GBI 1.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Ground-Based Interceptor]] of the United States' [[Ground-Based Midcourse Defense]] system, loaded into a silo at [[Fort Greely]], Alaska, in July 2004]]
An '''anti-ballistic missile''' ('''ABM''') is a [[surface-to-air missile]] designed to counter [[ballistic missile]]s (see [[missile defense]]). Ballistic missiles are used to deliver [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]], [[Chemical warfare|chemical]], [[Biological warfare|biological]] or conventional [[warhead]]s in a [[ballistics|ballistic]] flight [[trajectory]]. The term &quot;anti-ballistic missile&quot; is a generic term conveying a system designed to intercept and destroy any type of ballistic threat, however it is commonly used for systems specifically designed to counter [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs).

==Current counter-ICBM systems==
[[File:Arrow-3 Jan-03-2013 (c).jpg|thumb|200px|Israel's [[Arrow 3]]]]
There are only three systems in the world that can intercept ICBMs. Besides them, many smaller systems exist (tactical ABMs), that generally cannot intercept intercontinental strategic missiles, even if within range—an incoming ICBM simply moves too fast for these systems.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The Russian [[A-35 anti-ballistic missile system]], used for the defense of Moscow, whose development started in 1971. The currently active system is called [[A-135 anti-ballistic missile system|A-135]]. The system uses Gorgon and [[Gazelle (missile)|Gazelle]] missiles with [[nuclear warhead]]s to intercept incoming [[Intercontinental Ballistic Missile|ICBMs]].

The U.S. [[Ground-Based Midcourse Defense]] (GMD; previously known as [[National Missile Defense]] – NMD) system has reached initial operational capability. Instead of using an explosive charge, it launches a [[kinetic projectile]]. The George W. Bush administration accelerated development and deployment of a system proposed in 1998 by the Clinton administration. The system is a dual purpose test and interception facility in Alaska, and in 2006 was operational with a few interceptor missiles. The Alaska site provides more protection against the [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear threat]] from North Korean missiles or launches from Russia or China, but is likely less effective against missiles launched from the Middle East. President Bush referenced the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 and the proliferation of ballistic missiles as reasons for missile defense. The current GMD system has the more limited goal of shielding against a limited attack by a [[rogue state]] such as [[North Korea]].

Israel's Arrow 3 system entered operational service in 2017. It is designed for exo-atmosphere interception of ballistic missiles during the [[spaceflight]] portion of their trajectory, including those of [[ICBM]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Israel-successfully-tests-Davids-Slings-interceptor Israel successfully tests David's Sling's interceptor ] By YAAKOV LAPPIN, JPOST.COM, 11/25/2012&lt;/ref&gt; It may also act as an anti-satellite weapon.

===American plans for Central European site===
{{further|National missile defense#Recent developments}}
During 1993, a symposium was held by western European nations to discuss potential future ballistic missile defence programs. In the end, the council recommended deployment of early warning and surveillance systems as well as regionally controlled defence systems.&lt;ref&gt;Assembly of the [[Western European Union]]. Technological and Aerospace Committee. Lenzer. via FAS.[https://fas.org/spp/starwars/program/europe/weu_93/weu1363tasc.htm Anti-missile defence for Europe – guidelines drawn from the symposium]. 17 May 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;
During spring 2006 reports about negotiations between the United States and Poland as well as the Czech Republic were published. The plans propose the installation of a latest generation ABM system with a radar site in the Czech Republic and the [[U.S. missile defense complex in Poland|launch site in Poland]]. The system was announced to be aimed against ICBMs from Iran and North Korea. This caused harsh comments by Russian [[President of Russia|President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] at the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) security conference during spring 2007 in Munich. Other European ministers commented that any change of strategic weapons should be negotiated on [[NATO]] level and not 'unilaterally' [sic, actually bilaterally] between the U.S. and other states (although most strategic arms reduction treaties were between the Soviet Union and U.S., not NATO). German foreign minister [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] expressed severe concerns about the way in which the U.S. had conveyed its plans to its European partners and criticised the U.S. administration for not having consulted Russia prior to announcing its endeavours to deploy a new missile defence system in Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Gaspers, J.

===People's Republic of China===

==== Historical Project 640 ====
Project 640 had been the PRC's indigenous effort to develop ABM capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;sinodefence.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinodefence.com/special/airdefence/project640.asp |title=Project 640: China's National Missile Defence in the '70s |publisher=SinoDefence.com |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy of Anti-Ballistic Missile &amp; Anti-Satellite was established from 1969 for the purpose of developing Project 640.&lt;ref name=&quot;sinodefence.com&quot; /&gt; The project was to involve at least three elements, including the necessary sensors and guidance/command systems, the Fan Ji (FJ) missile interceptor, and the XianFeng missile-intercepting cannon.&lt;ref name=&quot;sinodefence.com&quot; /&gt; The FJ-1 had completed two successful flight tests during 1979, while the low-altitude interceptor FJ-2 completed some successful flight tests using scaled prototypes.&lt;ref name=&quot;sinodefence.com&quot; /&gt; A high altitude FJ-3 interceptor was also proposed. Despite the development of missiles, the programme was slowed down due to financial and political reasons. It was finally closed down during 1980 under a new leadership of Deng Xiaoping as it was seemingly deemed unnecessary after the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty between the Soviet Union and the United States and the closure of the US Safeguard ABM system.&lt;ref name=&quot;sinodefence.com&quot; /&gt;

==== Operational P.R.Chinese system ====
In March 2006, China tested an interceptor system comparable to the U.S. Patriot missiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?bicode=060000&amp;biid=2006032829898 |title=donga.com[English donga&amp;#93; |publisher=English.donga.com |date=28 March 2006 |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missilethreat.com/archives/id.537/detail.asp |title=Chinese Version of Patriot Interceptor Said Undergoing Tests |publisher=MissileThreat |date=29 March 2006 |accessdate=11 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720065356/http://www.missilethreat.com/archives/id.537/detail.asp |archivedate=20 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecuritynewswire.org/gsn/nw_20100112_1311.php |title=Pentagon Received No Warning of Chinese Missile Defense Test |publisher=Globalsecuritynewswire.org |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China has acquired and is license-producing the [[SA-10A Grumble#S-300PMU-1/2 (SA-20)|S-300PMU-2/S-300PMU-1]] series of terminal ABM-capable SAMs. China-produced [[HQ-9]] SAM system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinodefence.com/army/surfacetoairmissile/hongqi9.asp |title=HongQi 9 (HQ-9) Surface-to-Air Missile System |publisher=SinoDefence.com |date=3 October 2009 |accessdate=11 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904130239/http://www.sinodefence.com/army/surfacetoairmissile/hongqi9.asp |archivedate=4 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; may possess terminal ABM capabilities. PRC Navy's operating modern air-defense destroyers known as the [[Type 052C|Type 052C Destroyer]] and [[Type 051C destroyer|Type 051C Destroyer]] are armed with naval HHQ-9 missiles.

The HQ-19, similar to the [[THAAD]], was first tested in 2003, and subsequently a few more times, including in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/11/11/did-china-just-test-a-new-satellite-killer|title=Did China Just Test a New Satellite-Killer?|first=David|last=Axe|date=11 November 2015|website=The Daily Beast|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HQ-29, a counterpart to the [[MIM-104 Patriot#MIM-104F .28PAC-3.29|MIM-104F PAC-3]], was first tested in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/world/china/hq-29.htm|title=HQ-29 Anti-Ballistic Missile Interceptor|first=John|last=Pike|website=www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Development of midcourse ABM in P.R.China ====
The technology and experience from the successful [[2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test|anti-satellite test]] using a ground-launched interceptor during January 2007 was immediately applied to current ABM efforts and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinodefence.com/special/airdefence/fortress-china4.asp |title=4.

China carried out a [[2010 Chinese anti-ballistic missile test|land-based anti-ballistic missile test]] on 11 January 2010. The test was exoatmospheric and done in midcourse&lt;ref name=wikileaks&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/wikileaks-files/china-wikileaks/8299323/DEMARCHE-FOLLOWING-CHINAS-JANUARY-2010-INTERCEPT-FLIGHT-TEST.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Demarche Following China's January 2010 Intercept Flight-Test | date=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; phase and with a [[kinetic kill vehicle]].

On 27 January 2013, China did another anti ballistic missile test. According to the Chinese Defence Ministry, the missile launch is defensive in character and is not aimed against any countries. Experts hailed China's technological breakthrough because it is difficult to intercept ballistic missiles that have reached the highest point and speed in the middle of their course. Only 2 countries, including the US, have successfully conducted such a test in the past decade.

=====Arrow 2=====
{{Main|Arrow (Israeli missile)}}
[[File:Arrow2 96aug.jpg|thumb|170px|right|An Arrow 2 anti-ballistic missile interceptor]]
The Arrow project was begun after the U.S. and Israel agreed to co-fund it on 6 May 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.policyalmanac.org/world/archive/crs_israeli-us_relations.shtml | title = Israeli-United States Relations |publisher=Policy almanac |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arrow ABM system was designed and constructed in Israel with financial support by the United States by a multibillion-dollar development program called &quot;Minhelet Homa&quot; with the participation of companies like [[Israel Military Industries]], [[Tadiran Telecom|Tadiran]] and [[Israel Aerospace Industries]].

During 1998 the Israeli military conducted a successful test of their Arrow missile. Designed to intercept incoming missiles travelling at up to 2 mile/s (3&amp;nbsp;km/s), the Arrow is expected to perform much better than the Patriot did in the Gulf War. On 29 July 2004 Israel and the United States carried out joint experiment in the USA, in which the Arrow was launched against a real Scud missile. The experiment was a success, as the Arrow destroyed the Scud with a direct hit. During December 2005 the system was deployed successfully in a test against a replicated [[Shahab-3]] missile. This feat was repeated on 11 February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6352659.stm | publisher =BBC | work = News | title= Israeli missile test 'successful' | date=11 February 2007 | accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Arrow 3 =====
{{main|Arrow 3}}
[[File:AST-15-001.jpg|thumb|[[Arrow 3]] in testing.]]
The Arrow 3 system is capable of exo-atmosphere interception of ballistic missiles, including of [[ICBM]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Israel-successfully-tests-Davids-Slings-interceptor http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Israel-successfully-tests-Davids-Slings-interceptor] By YAAKOV LAPPIN, JPOST.COM, 11/25/2012&lt;/ref&gt; It also act as an anti-satellite weapon.

Lieutenant General Patrick J. O'Reilly, Director of the US [[Missile Defense Agency]], said: &quot;The design of Arrow 3 promises to be an extremely capable system, more advanced than what we have ever attempted in the U.S. with our programs.&quot;

On December 10, 2015 Arrow 3 scored its first intercept in a complex test designed to validate how the system can detect, identify, track and then discriminate real from decoy targets delivered into space by an improved [[Sparrow (target missile)|Silver Sparrow]] target missile.&lt;ref name=goodtest&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/air-space/strike/2015/12/10/us-israel-arrow-3-intercepts-target-space/77087084/ |work=[[Defense News]] |title=US-Israel Arrow-3 intercepts target in space |first=Barbara |last=Opall-Rome |date=2015-12-10 |accessdate=2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to officials, the milestone test paves the way toward [[Low rate initial production|low-rate initial production]] of the Arrow 3.&lt;ref name=goodtest/&gt;

David's Sling (Hebrew: קלע דוד), also sometimes called Magic Wand (Hebrew: שרביט קסמים), is an Israel Defense Forces military system being jointly developed by the Israeli defense contractor Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and the American defense contractor Raytheon, designed to intercept tactical ballistic missiles, as well as medium- to long-range rockets and slower-flying cruise missiles, such as those possessed by Hezbollah, fired at ranges from 40&amp;nbsp;km to 300&amp;nbsp;km. It is designed with the aim of intercepting the newest generation of tactical ballistic missiles, such as [[9K720 Iskander|Iskander]].

Since 1998, when North Korea launched a [[Taepodong-1]] missile over northern Japan, the Japanese have been jointly developing a new surface-to-air interceptor known as the Patriot Advanced Capability 3 (PAC-3) with the US. So far tests have been successful, and there are planned 11 locations that the PAC-3 will be installed. A military spokesman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7188698.stm |work=BBC News | title=Japan plans Tokyo missile shield | date=15 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; said that tests had been done on two sites, one of them a business park in central Tokyo, and Ichigaya – a site not far from the Imperial Palace.
Along with the PAC-3, Japan has installed a US-developed ship-based anti-ballistic missile system, which was tested successfully on 18 December 2007. The missile was launched from a Japanese warship, in partnership with the U.S. Missile Defense Agency and destroyed a mock target launched from the coast.

In several tests, the U.S. military have demonstrated the feasibility of destroying long and short range ballistic missiles. Combat effectiveness of newer systems against 1950s tactical ballistic missiles seems very high, as the [[MIM-104 Patriot]] (PAC-1 and PAC-2) had a 100% success rate in Operation Iraqi Freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/ops/oif-patriot.htm |title='&amp;#39;Operation Iraqi Freedom – Patriot'&amp;#39; |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of ABMs==

===1940s and 1950s===
[[File:NIKE Zeus.jpg|thumb|right|Launch of an [[US Army]] [[Nike Zeus]] missile, the first ABM system to enter widespread testing.]]
The idea of destroying rockets before they can hit their target dates from the first use of modern missiles in warfare, the German [[V-1 (flying bomb)|V-1]] and [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] program of [[World War II]].

British fighters destroyed some V-1 &quot;buzz bombs&quot; in flight, although concentrated barrages of heavy anti-aircraft artillery had greater success. Under the lend-lease program, 200 US [[90 mm Gun M1/M2/M3|90 mm AA]] guns with [[SCR-584 radar]]s and [[Western Electric]]/[[Bell Labs]] computers were sent to the UK. These demonstrated a 95% success rate against V-1s that flew into their range.&lt;ref name=cav&gt;Gregory Canavan, [http://missilethreat.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/20030000-Heritage-canavan.pdf &quot;Missile Defense for the 21st Century&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713192027/http://missilethreat.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/20030000-Heritage-canavan.pdf |date=13 July 2015 }}, Heritage Foundation, 2003, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

The V-2, the first true ballistic missile, was impossible to destroy in the air. SCR-584's could be used to plot the trajectories of the missiles and provide some warning, but were more useful in backtracking their ballistic trajectory and determining the rough launch locations. The Allies launched [[Operation Crossbow]] to find and destroy V-2s before launch, but these operations were largely ineffective. In one instance a Spitfire happened upon a V-2 rising through the trees, and fired on it with no effect.&lt;ref name=cav/&gt; This led to allied efforts to capture launching sites in Belgium and the Netherlands.

A wartime study by Bell Labs into the task of shooting down ballistic missiles in flight concluded it was not possible. In order to intercept a missile, one needs to be able to steer the attack onto the missile before it hits. A V-2's speed would require guns of effectively infinite reaction time, or some sort of weapon with ranges on the order of dozens of miles, neither of which appeared possible. This was, however, just before the emergence of high-speed computing systems. By the mid-1950s, things had changed considerably, and many forces worldwide were considering ABM systems.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The American armed forces began experimenting with anti-missile missiles soon after World War II, as the extent of German research into rocketry became clear. But defences against Soviet long-range bombers took priority until 1957, when the Soviet Union demonstrated its advances in ICBM technology with the launch of [[Sputnik program|Sputnik]], the Earth's first artificial satellite. The [[US Army]] accelerated development of their [[LIM-49 Nike Zeus]] system in response. Zeus was criticized throughout its development program, especially from those within the [[US Air Force]] and nuclear weapons establishments who suggested it would be much simpler to build more nuclear warheads and guarantee [[mutually assured destruction]]. Zeus was eventually cancelled in 1963.

In 1958, the U.S. sought to explore whether airbursting nuclear weapons might be used to ward off ICBMs. It conducted several test explosions of low-yield [[nuclear weapon]]s — 1.7kt boosted fission [[W25 (nuclear warhead)|W25 warhead]]s — launched from ships to very high altitudes over the southern Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Nuclear Weapon Archive.org. [http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Tests/Argus.html Argus].&lt;/ref&gt; Such an explosion releases a burst of [[X-ray]]s in the Earth's atmosphere, causing secondary showers of charged particles over an area hundreds of miles across. These can become trapped in the Earth' magnetic field, creating an artificial radiation belt. It was believed that this might be strong enough to damage warheads traveling through the layer. This proved not to be the case, but [[Operation Argus|Argus]] returned key data about a related effect, the [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse]] (NEMP).

===Canada===
Other countries were also involved in early ABM research. A more advanced project was at [[DRE Valcartier|CARDE]] in Canada, which researched the main problems of ABM systems. A key problem with any radar system is that the signal is in the form of a cone, which spreads with distance from the transmitter. For long-distance interceptions like ABM systems, the inherent inaccuracy of the radar makes an interception difficult. CARDE considered using a [[terminal guidance]] system to address the accuracy concerns, and developed several advanced [[infrared]] detectors for this role. They also studied a number of missile airframe designs, a new and much more powerful solid rocket fuel, and numerous systems for testing it all. After a series of drastic budget reductions during the late 1950s the research ended. One offshoot of the project was [[Gerald Bull]]'s system for inexpensive high-speed testing, consisting of missile airframes shot from a [[sabot]] round, which would later be the basis of [[Project HARP]]. Another was the [[CRV7]] and [[Black Brant (rocket)|Black Brant]] rockets, which used the new solid rocket fuel.

===Soviet Union===
The Soviet military had requested funding for ABM research as early as 1953, but were only given the go-ahead to begin deployment of such a system on 17 August 1956. Their test system, known simply as System A, was based on the [[Fakel V-1000|V-1000]] missile, which was similar to the early US efforts. The first successful test interception was carried out on 24 November 1960, and the first with a live warhead on 4 March 1961. In this test, a dummy warhead was released by a [[R-12 (missile)|R-12]] [[ballistic missile]] launched from the [[Kapustin Yar]],&lt;ref name=gobarev&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gobarev |first1=Victor |year=2001 |title=The early development of Russia's ballistic missile defense system |journal=The Journal of Slavic Military Studies |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=29–48|doi=10.1080/13518040108430478}} Viewed 26 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and intercepted by a V-1000 launched from  [[Sary-Shagan]]. The dummy warhead was destroyed by the impact of 16,000 [[tungsten-carbide]] spherical [[impactors]] 140 seconds after launch, at an altitude of {{convert|25|km|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karpenko1999&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| first = A| last = Karpenko| year = 1999| title = ABM AND SPACE DEFENSE| journal = Nevsky Bastion| volume = 4| pages = 2–47| url = https://fas.org/spp/starwars/program/soviet/990600-bmd-rus.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The V-1000 missile system was nonetheless considered not reliable enough and abandoned in favour of nuclear-armed ABMs. A much larger missile, the [[ABM-1 Galosh|Fakel 5V61]] (known in the west as Galosh), was developed to carry the larger warhead and carry it much further from the launch site. Further development continued, and the [[A-35 anti-ballistic missile system]], designed to protect Moscow, became operational in 1971. A-35 was designed for exoatmospheric interceptions, and would have been highly susceptible to a well-arranged attack using multiple warheads and radar black-out techniques.

A-35 was upgraded during the 1980s to a two-layer system, the [[A-135 anti-ballistic missile system|A-135]]. The Gorgon (SH-11/ABM-4) long-range missile was designed to handle intercepts outside the atmosphere, and the [[53T6|Gazelle (SH-08/ABM-3)]] short-range missile endoatmospheric intercepts that eluded Gorgon. The A-135 system is considered to be technologically equivalent to the United States Safeguard system of 1975.&lt;ref&gt;GlobalSecurity.org. [http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/russia/abm3.htm -135 anti-ballistic missile system].&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Nike-X and Sentinel===
[[Nike Zeus]] failed to be a credible defence in an era of rapidly increasing ICBM counts due to its ability to attack only one target at a time. Additionally, significant concerns about its ability to successfully intercept warheads in the presence of high-altitude nuclear explosions, including its own, lead to the conclusion that the system would simply be too costly for the very low amount of protection it could provide.

By the time it was cancelled in 1963, potential upgrades had been explored for some time. Among these were radars capable of scanning much greater volumes of space and able to track many warheads and launch several missiles at once. These, however, did not address the problems identified with radar blackouts caused by high-altitude explosions. To address this need, a new missile with extreme performance was designed to attack incoming warheads at much lower altitudes, as low as 20&amp;nbsp;km. The new project encompassing all of these upgrades was launched as [[Nike-X]].

The main missile was [[LIM-49 Spartan]]—a Nike Zeus upgraded for longer range and a much larger 5 megaton warhead intended to destroy enemy's warheads with a burst of x-rays outside the atmosphere. A second shorter-range missile called [[Sprint (missile)|Sprint]] with very high acceleration was added to handle warheads that evaded longer-ranged Spartan. Sprint was a very fast missile (some sources{{who|date=March 2015}} claimed it accelerated to 8,000&amp;nbsp;mph (13&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;km/h) within 4 seconds of flight—an average acceleration of ''90 [[g-force|g]]'') and had a smaller W66 [[Neutron bomb|enhanced radiation]] warhead in the 1–3 kiloton range for in-atmosphere interceptions.

The experimental success of Nike X persuaded the [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] administration to propose a thin ABM defense, that could provide almost complete coverage of the United States. In a September 1967 speech, Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]] referred to it as &quot;Sentinel&quot;. McNamara, a private ABM opponent because of cost and feasibility (see [[cost-exchange ratio]]), claimed that Sentinel would be directed not against the Soviet Union's missiles (since the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] had more than enough missiles to overwhelm any American defense), but rather against the potential nuclear threat of the People's Republic of China.

In the meantime, a public debate over the merit of ABMs began. Difficulties that had already made an ABM system questionable for defending against an all-out attack. One problem was the [[Fractional Orbital Bombardment System]] (FOBS) that would give little warning to the defense. Another problem was high altitude EMP (whether from offensive or defensive nuclear warheads) which could degrade defensive radar systems.

When this proved infeasible for economic reasons, a much smaller deployment using the same systems was proposed, namely Safeguard (described later).

===The problem of defense against MIRVs===
[[File:Peacekeeper-missile-testing.jpg|thumb|right|Testing of the [[LGM-118A Peacekeeper]] re-entry vehicles, all eight shot from only one missile. Each line represents the path of a warhead which, were it live, would detonate with the explosive power of twenty-five [[Little Boy|Hiroshima-style]] weapons.]]
ABM systems were developed initially to counter single warheads launched from large [[Intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs). The economics seemed simple enough; since rocket costs increase rapidly with size, the price of the ICBM launching a large warhead should always be greater than the much smaller interceptor missile needed to destroy it. In an arms race the defense would always win.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In practice, the price of the interceptor missile was considerable, due to its sophistication. The system had to be guided all the way to an interception, which demanded guidance and control systems that worked within and outside the atmosphere. The Nike Zeus was expected to cost about $1 million{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}, about the same as an ICBM{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}. However, due to their relatively short ranges, an ABM missile would be needed to counter an ICBM wherever it might be aimed. That implies that dozens of interceptors are needed for every ICBM.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} This led to intense debates about the &quot;[[cost-exchange ratio]]&quot; between interceptors and warheads.

Conditions changed dramatically in 1970 with the introduction of [[Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle]] (MIRV) warheads. Suddenly, each launcher was throwing not one warhead, but several. These would spread out in space, ensuring that a single interceptor would be needed for each warhead. This simply added to the need to have several interceptors for each warhead in order to provide geographical coverage. Now it was clear that an ABM system would always be many times more expensive than the ICBMs they defended against{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}.

===The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972===
{{main|Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty}}
Technical, economic and political problems described resulted in the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty|ABM treaty]] of 1972, which restricted the deployment of strategic (not tactical) anti-ballistic missiles.

By the ABM treaty and a 1974 revision, each country was allowed to deploy a mere 100 ABMs to protect a single, small area. The Soviets retained their Moscow defences. The U.S. designated their ICBM sites near Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota, where Safeguard was already under advanced development. The radar systems and anti-ballistic missiles were approximately 90 miles north/northwest of Grand Forks AFB, near Concrete, North Dakota. The missiles were deactivated in 1975. The main radar site (PARCS) is still used as an early warning ICBM radar, facing relative north. It is located at Cavalier Air Force Station, North Dakota.

===Brief use of Safeguard in 1975/1976===
The U.S. [[Safeguard Program|Safeguard]] system, which utilized the nuclear-tipped [[LIM-49A Spartan]] and [[Sprint (missile)|Sprint]] missiles, in the short operational period of 1975/1976, was the second counter-ICBMs system in the world. Safeguard protected only the main fields of US ICBMs from attack, theoretically ensuring that an attack could be responded to with a US launch, enforcing the [[mutually assured destruction]] principle.

===SDI experiments in the 1980s===
{{main|Strategic Defense Initiative}}
The [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]-era [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (often referred to as &quot;Star Wars&quot;), along with research into various energy-beam weaponry, brought new interest in the area of ABM technologies.

SDI was an extremely ambitious program to provide a total shield against a massive Soviet ICBM attack. The initial concept envisioned large sophisticated orbiting laser battle stations, space-based relay mirrors, and nuclear-pumped X-ray laser satellites. Later research indicated that some planned technologies such as X-ray [[laser]]s were not feasible with then-current technology. As research continued, SDI evolved through various concepts as designers struggled with the difficulty of such a large complex defense system. SDI remained a research program and was never deployed. Several post-SDI technologies are used by the present [[Missile Defense Agency]] (MDA).

Lasers originally developed for the SDI plan are in use for astronomical observations. Used to ionize gas in the upper atmosphere, they provide telescope operators with a target to calibrate their instruments.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Tactical ABMs deployed in 1990s===
The Israeli [[Arrow (Israeli missile)|Arrow missile]] system was tested initially during 1990, before the [[first Gulf War]]. The Arrow was supported by the United States throughout the 1990s.

The [[Patriot missile|Patriot]] was the first deployed tactical ABM system, although it was not designed from the outset for that task and consequently had limitations. It was used during the 1991 Gulf War to attempt to intercept Iraqi [[Scud]] missiles. Post-war analyses show that the Patriot was much less effective than initially thought because of its radar and control system's inability to discriminate warheads from other objects when the Scud missiles broke up during reentry.

&lt;!--[https://fas.org/spp/starwars/program/nmd/index.html FAS] also has a time line for ABM/NMB/TBMD starting in [https://fas.org/spp/starwars/program/milestone.htm Missile Defense Milestones]--&gt;
Testing ABM technology continued during the 1990s with mixed success. After the Gulf War, improvements were made to several U.S. air defense systems. A new Patriot, [[PAC-3]], was developed and tested—a complete redesign of the PAC-2 deployed during the war, including a totally new missile.
The improved guidance, radar and missile performance improves the probability of kill over the earlier PAC-2. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, Patriot PAC-3s had a nearly 100% success rate against Iraqi TBMs fired. However, since no longer range Iraqi Scud missiles were used, PAC-3 effectiveness against those was untested. Patriot was involved in three [[friendly fire]] incidents: two incidents of Patriot shootings at coalition aircraft and one of U.S. aircraft shooting at a Patriot battery.&lt;ref&gt;Defense Science Board Task Force.

(PDF) January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new version of the Hawk missile was tested during the early to mid-1990s and by the end of 1998 the majority of US Marine Corps [[MIM-23 Hawk|Hawk]] systems were modified to support basic theater anti-ballistic missile capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;FAS. [https://fas.org/spp/starwars/program/hawk.htm Hawk].&lt;/ref&gt; [[MIM-23 Hawk]] missile is not operational in the U.S. service since 2002, but is used by many other countries.

Soon after the Gulf war, the [[Aegis combat system]] was expanded to include ABM capabilities. The [[RIM-156 Standard|Standard missile]] system was also enhanced and tested for ballistic missile interception. During the late 1990s, SM-2 block IVA missiles were tested in a theater ballistic missile defense function.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/spp/starwars/program/sm2.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812145613/https://fas.org/spp/starwars/program/sm2.htm |date=12 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RIM-161 Standard missile 3|Standard Missile 3 (SM-3)]] systems have also been tested for an ABM role. In 2008, an SM-3 missile launched from a [[Ticonderoga-class cruiser|''Ticonderoga''-class cruiser]], the [[USS Lake Erie (CG-70)|USS Lake Erie]], successfully intercepted [[USA-193|a non-functioning satellite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=DoD Succeeds In Intercepting Non-Functioning Satellite|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=11704|date=20 February 2008|number=No. 0139-08|publisher=U.S. Department of Defense|accessdate=20 February 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080226105236/http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=11704| archivedate= 26 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title= Navy Succeeds In Intercepting Non-Functioning Satellite|url=http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=35114|publisher=U.S. Navy|date=20 February 2008|number=NNS080220-19|accessdate=20 February 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080225234718/http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=35114| archivedate= 25 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1992 to 2000, a demonstration system for the US Army [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense]] was deployed at [[White Sands Missile Range]]. Tests were conducted on a regular basis and resulted in early failures, but successful intercepts occurred from 1999 onward.  The US Army is in the process of fielding THAAD line batteries.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Brilliant Pebbles concept===
Approved for acquisition by the Pentagon during 1991 but never realized, [[Brilliant Pebbles]] was a proposed space-based anti-ballistic system that was meant to avoid some of the problems of the earlier SDI concepts. Rather than use sophisticated large laser battle stations and nuclear-pumped X-ray laser satellites, Brilliant Pebbles consisted of a thousand very small, intelligent orbiting satellites with kinetic warheads. The system relied on improvements of computer technology, avoided problems with overly centralized command and control and risky, expensive development of large, complicated space defense satellites.
It promised to be much less expensive to develop and have less technical development risk.

The name Brilliant Pebbles comes from the small size of the satellite interceptors and great computational power enabling more autonomous targeting. Rather than rely exclusively on ground-based control, the many small interceptors would cooperatively communicate among themselves and target a large swarm of ICBM warheads in space or in the late boost phase. Development was discontinued later in favor of a limited ground-based defense.

===Transformation of SDI into MDA, development of NMD/GMD===
While the Reagan era Strategic Defense Initiative was intended to shield against a massive Soviet attack, during the early 1990s, President [[George H. W. Bush]] called for a more limited version using rocket-launched interceptors based on the ground at a single site. Such system was developed since 1992, was expected to become operational in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD)|url=http://www.mda.mil/system/gmd.html|publisher=MDA|accessdate=8 February 2011|quote=&quot;A total of 30 interceptors are planned for deployment by the end of 2010. &quot;|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206200507/http://www.mda.mil/system/gmd.html|archivedate=6 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and capable of intercepting small number of incoming ICBMs. First called the National Missile Defense (NMD), since 2002 it was renamed [[Ground-Based Midcourse Defense]] (GMD). It was planned to protect all 50 states from a rogue missile attack. The Alaska site provides more protection against North Korean missiles or accidental launches from Russia or China, but is likely less effective against missiles launched from the Middle East. The Alaska interceptors may be augmented later by the naval Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, by ground-based missiles in other locations, or by the [[Boeing YAL-1|Boeing Airborne Laser]].

During 1998, Defense secretary [[William Cohen]] proposed spending an additional $6.6 billion on intercontinental ballistic missile defense programs to build a system to protect against attacks from North Korea or accidental launches from Russia or China.&lt;ref&gt;PBS.

In terms of organization, during 1993 SDI was reorganized as the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO). In 2002, it was renamed to [[Missile Defense Agency]] (MDA).

===U.S withdrawal from Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002===
On 13 June 2002, the United States withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and recommenced developing missile defense systems that would have formerly been prohibited by the bilateral treaty. The action was stated as needed to defend against the possibility of a missile attack conducted by a [[rogue state]].

The next day, the Russian Federation dropped the [[START II]] agreement, intended to completely ban [[MIRV]]s.

===ABM test targets===
On 15 December 2016, the US Army [[SMDC]] had a successful test of a U.S. Army Zombie Pathfinder rocket, to be used as a target for exercising various anti-ballistic missile scenarios. The rocket was launched as part of NASA's [[sounding rocket]] program, at White Sands Missile Range.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.army.mil/article/179788/us_army_announces_successful_test_of_us_army_zombie_pathfinder_rocket U.S. Army announces successful test of U.S. Army Zombie Pathfinder rocket] accessdate=2017-01-08&lt;/ref&gt;
