Afghanistan is bordered by [[Pakistan]] in the south and east; [[Iran]] in the west; [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], and [[Tajikistan]] in the north; and [[China]] in the far northeast. Its territory covers {{convert|652,000|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, making it the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|41st largest]] country in the world.

Human habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the [[Middle Paleolithic]] Era, and the country's [[Geostrategy|strategic]] location along the [[Silk Road]] connected it to the cultures of the Middle East and other parts of Asia. The land has historically been home to various peoples and has witnessed numerous military campaigns, including those by [[Alexander the Great]], [[Maurya Empire|Mauryas]], [[Islamic conquest of Afghanistan|Muslim Arabs]], [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran|Mongols]], [[First Anglo-Afghan War|British]], [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet]], and in the modern era by [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Western powers]].

The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan began with the Hotak and Durrani dynasties in the 18th century.  In the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a [[buffer state]] in the &quot;[[The Great Game|Great Game]]&quot; between [[British Raj|British India]] and the [[Russian Empire]]. Following the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] in 1919, [[Amanullah Khan|King Amanullah]] unsuccessfully attempted to modernize the country. Afghanistan remained peaceful during [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah's]] forty years of monarchy. A series of coups in the 1970s was followed by a [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|series of civil wars]] that devastated much of Afghanistan which began when the country [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|became a socialist state]] under the influence of the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Soviet–Afghan War]]. Following the [[Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan|departure of the Soviet forces]], the country became an [[Islamic State of Afghanistan|Islamic state]] under the [[Peshawar Accord]] but much of its territory was then held by the [[Islamism|Islamic supremacist]] group the [[Taliban]], who ruled the country as a [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|totalitarian regime for almost five years]]. Following the 2001 [[September 11 attacks]] in the [[United States]], the Taliban was [[Battle of Tora Bora|forcibly removed]] by the [[NATO]]-[[International Security Assistance Force|led coalition]], Afghanistan's previous political structure was replaced with a more [[Western world|pro-Western]], democratically-elected government.

Afghanistan is a [[unitary state|unitary]] [[presidential system|presidential]] [[Islamic republic]] with [[Islam in Afghanistan|Islam]] as an official [[state religion]]. It is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], the [[Group of 77]], the  [[Economic Cooperation Organization]], and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. [[Economy of Afghanistan|Afghanistan's economy]] is the world's 108th largest, with a [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of $64.08 billion; the country fares much worse in terms of per-capita GDP (PPP), ranking 167th out of 186 countries in a 2016 report from the [[International Monetary Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2017/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=43&amp;pr.y=5&amp;sy=2016&amp;ey=2016&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=512%2C672%2C914%2C946%2C612%2C137%2C614%2C546%2C311%2C962%2C213%2C674%2C911%2C676%2C193%2C548%2C122%2C556%2C912%2C678%2C313%2C181%2C419%2C867%2C513%2C682%2C316%2C684%2C913%2C273%2C124%2C868%2C339%2C921%2C638%2C948%2C514%2C943%2C218%2C686%2C963%2C688%2C616%2C518%2C223%2C728%2C516%2C836%2C918%2C558%2C748%2C138%2C618%2C196%2C624%2C278%2C522%2C692%2C622%2C694%2C156%2C142%2C626%2C449%2C628%2C564%2C228%2C565%2C924%2C283%2C233%2C853%2C632%2C288%2C636%2C293%2C634%2C566%2C238%2C964%2C662%2C182%2C960%2C359%2C423%2C453%2C935%2C968%2C128%2C922%2C611%2C714%2C321%2C862%2C243%2C135%2C248%2C716%2C469%2C456%2C253%2C722%2C642%2C942%2C643%2C718%2C939%2C724%2C644%2C576%2C819%2C936%2C172%2C961%2C132%2C813%2C646%2C199%2C648%2C733%2C915%2C184%2C134%2C524%2C652%2C361%2C174%2C362%2C328%2C364%2C258%2C732%2C656%2C366%2C654%2C734%2C336%2C144%2C263%2C146%2C268%2C463%2C532%2C528%2C944%2C923%2C176%2C738%2C534%2C578%2C536%2C537%2C429%2C742%2C433%2C866%2C178%2C369%2C436%2C744%2C136%2C186%2C343%2C925%2C158%2C869%2C439%2C746%2C916%2C926%2C664%2C466%2C826%2C112%2C542%2C111%2C967%2C298%2C443%2C927%2C917%2C846%2C544%2C299%2C941%2C582%2C446%2C474%2C666%2C754%2C668%2C698&amp;s=PPPPC&amp;grp=0&amp;a=&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
{{Main article|Name of Afghanistan}}
The name ''Afghānistān'' ([[Pashto]] |افغانستان) is believed to be as old as the [[ethnonym]] [[Afghan (ethnonym)|''Afghan'']], which is documented in the 10th-century [[geography]] book ''[[Hudud ul-'alam]]''. The [[root (linguistics)|root]] name &quot;[[Afghan]]&quot; was used [[history|historically]] in reference to a member of the ethnic [[Pashtuns]], and the [[suffix]] &quot;[[-stan]]&quot; means &quot;place of&quot; in [[Persian Language|Persian]] and [[Hindi]]. Therefore, Afghanistan translates to ''land of the Afghans'' or, more specifically in a historical sense, to ''land of the Pashtuns''. However, the modern [[Constitution of Afghanistan]] states that &quot;[t]he word Afghan shall apply to every [[Demographics of Afghanistan|citizen of Afghanistan]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of Afghanistan|url=http://www.embassyofafghanistan.org/page/constitution |year=2004 |accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Afghanistan}}
[[Excavation (archaeology)|Excavations]] of prehistoric sites by [[Louis Dupree (professor)|Louis Dupree]] and others suggest that humans were living in what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities in the area were among the earliest in the world. An important site of early historical activities, many believe that Afghanistan compares to [[Egypt]] in terms of the historical value of its archaeological sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;JFS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_761569370___42/Afghanistan.html |title=Afghanistan&amp;nbsp;– John Ford Shroder, University of Nebraska |publisher=Webcitation.org |accessdate=19 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwDUj6WJ?url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_761569370___42/Afghanistan.html |archivedate=31 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1881896-1,00.html |title=Afghanistan: A Treasure Trove for Archaeologists |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] |date=26 February 2009 |accessdate=13 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726153721/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1881896-1%2C00.html |archivedate=26 July 2013 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country sits at a unique nexus point where numerous civilizations have interacted and often fought. It has been home to various peoples through the ages, among them the [[ancient Iranian peoples]] who established the dominant role of [[Indo-Iranian languages]] in the region. At multiple points, the land has been incorporated within large regional empires, among them the [[Achaemenid Empire]], the [[Alexander the Great|Macedonian Empire]], the [[Maurya Empire|Indian Maurya Empire]], and the [[Islamic conquest of Afghanistan|Islamic Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;The Indo-Aryans of Ancient South Asia: Language, Material Culture and Ethnicity by George Erdosy, p.321&lt;/ref&gt;

Many empires and kingdoms have also risen to power in Afghanistan, such as the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrians]], [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], [[Hephthalites]], [[Kabul Shahi]]s, [[Saffarid Dynasty|Saffarids]], [[Samanids]], [[Ghaznavids]], [[Ghurid Dynasty|Ghurids]], [[Khalji dynasty|Khaljis]], [[Kartids]], [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], and finally the [[Hotak dynasty|Hotak]] and [[Durrani dynasty|Durrani]] dynasties that marked the political origins of the modern state.&lt;ref&gt;The History of Afghanistan by Meredith L.

[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] exploration done in the 20th century suggests that the geographical area of Afghanistan has been closely connected by culture and trade with its neighbors to the east, west, and north. Artifacts typical of the [[Paleolithic]], [[Mesolithic]], [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age|Bronze]], and [[Iron age]]s have been found in Afghanistan. Urban civilization is believed to have begun as early as 3000 BCE, and the early city of [[Mundigak]] (near [[Kandahar]] in the south of the country) may have been a colony of the nearby [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. More recent findings established that the Indus Valley Civilisation stretched up towards modern-day Afghanistan, making the ancient civilisation today part of Pakistan, Afghanistan and India. In more detail, it extended from what today is northwest Pakistan to northwest India and northeast Afghanistan. An Indus Valley site has been found on the [[Oxus River]] at [[Shortugai]] in northern Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Ancient Indus pp.1&quot;&gt;The Ancient Indus: Urbanism, Economy, and Society. pp.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenoyer, Jonathan Mark (1998).

After 2000 BCE, successive waves of semi-nomadic people from Central Asia began moving south into Afghanistan; among them were many [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European-speaking]] [[Indo-Iranians]]. These tribes later migrated further into South Asia, Western Asia, and toward Europe via the area north of the [[Caspian Sea]]. The region at the time was referred to as [[Ariana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JFS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Edwin F.

The religion [[Zoroastrianism]] is believed by some to have originated in what is now Afghanistan between 1800 and 800 BCE, as its founder [[Zoroaster]] is thought to have lived and died in [[Balkh]]. Ancient [[Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian languages]] may have been spoken in the region around the time of the rise of Zoroastrianism. By the middle of the 6th century BCE, the Achaemenids overthrew the [[Medes]] and incorporated [[Arachosia]], [[Aria (satrapy)|Aria]], and [[Bactria]] within its eastern boundaries. An [[Epigraphy|inscription]] on the tombstone of [[Darius I of Persia]] mentions the [[Kabulistan|Kabul Valley]] in a list of the 29 countries that he had conquered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gandhara.com.au/afghan_table.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120909000527/http://www.gandhara.com.au/afghan_table.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 September 2012 |title=Chronological History of Afghanistan&amp;nbsp;– the cradle of Gandharan civilisation |publisher=Gandhara.com.au |date=15 February 1989 |accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander the Great]] and his Macedonian forces arrived to Afghanistan in 330 BCE after defeating [[Darius III of Persia]] a year earlier in the [[Battle of Gaugamela]]. Following Alexander's brief occupation, the successor state of the [[Seleucid Empire]] controlled the region until 305 BCE, when they gave much of it to the [[Maurya Empire]] as part of an alliance treaty. The Mauryans controlled the area south of the [[Hindu Kush]] until they were overthrown in about 185 BCE. Their decline began 60 years after [[Ashoka]]'s rule ended, leading to the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] reconquest by the [[Greco-Bactrians]]. Much of it soon broke away from them and became part of the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]. They were defeated and expelled by the [[Indo-Scythians]] in the late 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoC-pdf&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf |title=Country Profile: Afghanistan |publisher=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]] on Afghanistan |date=August 2008 |accessdate=10 October 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408085103/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf |archivedate=8 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The History of Afghanistan by Meredith L.

During the first century BCE, the [[Parthian Empire]] subjugated the region, but lost it to their [[Indo-Parthian]] vassals. In the mid-to-late first century CE the vast [[Kushan Empire]], centered in Afghanistan, became great patrons of Buddhist culture, making [[Buddhism]] flourish throughout the region. The Kushans were overthrown by the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] in the 3rd century CE, though the [[Indo-Sassanids]] continued to rule at least parts of the region. They were followed by the [[Kidarite]] who, in turn, were replaced by the [[Hephthalites]]. By the 6th century CE, the successors to the Kushans and Hepthalites established a small dynasty called [[Kabul Shahi]]. Much of the northeastern and southern areas of the country remained dominated by Buddhist culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Habibi&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alamahabibi.com/English%20Articles/Afghan_and_Afghanistan.htm |title=Afghan and Afghanistan |work=[[Abdul Hai Habibi]]|publisher=alamahabibi.com|year=1969|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arab]] [[Muslim]]s brought Islam to [[Herat]] and [[Zaranj]] in 642&amp;nbsp;CE and began spreading eastward; some of the native inhabitants they encountered accepted it while others revolted. The land was collectively recognized by the Arabs as al-Hind due to its cultural connection with [[Greater India]]. Before Islam was introduced, people of the region were mostly Buddhists and Zoroastrians, but there were also [[Surya]] and [[Nana (Afghan goddess)|Nana]] worshipers, [[History of the Jews in Afghanistan|Jews]], and others. The [[Zunbils]] and Kabul Shahi were first conquered in 870&amp;nbsp;CE by the [[Saffarid Dynasty|Saffarid]] Muslims of Zaranj. Later, the [[Samanids]] extended their Islamic influence south of the [[Hindu]] Kush. It is reported that Muslims and non-Muslims still lived side by side in Kabul before the [[Ghaznavids]] rose to power in the 10th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elliot-2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://persian.packhum.org/persian/pf?file=80201012&amp;ct=98 |title=A.—The Hindu Kings of Kábul |work=Sir H.

By the 11th century, [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] defeated the remaining Hindu rulers and effectively [[Islamized]] the wider region, with the exception of [[Kafiristan]]. Afghanistan became one of the main centers in the [[Muslim world]] during this [[Islamic Golden Age]]. The [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid dynasty]] was overthrown by the [[Ghurid Dynasty|Ghurids]], who expanded and advanced the already powerful Islamic empire.

In 1219&amp;nbsp;AD, [[Genghis Khan]] and his [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] army overran the region. His troops are said to have annihilated the Khorasanian cities of Herat and Balkh as well as [[Bamyan, Afghanistan|Bamyan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm |title=Central Asian world cities |publisher=Faculty.washington.edu |date=29 September 2007 |accessdate=6 May 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723185841/https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm |archivedate=23 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction caused by the Mongols forced many locals to return to an agrarian rural society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Page |first=Susan |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2009-02-17-afghanistan-forces_N.htm |title=Obama's war: Deploying 17,000 raises stakes in Afghanistan |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=18 February 2009 |accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mongol rule continued with the [[Ilkhanate]] in the northwest while the [[Khalji dynasty]] administered the Afghan tribal areas south of the Hindu Kush until the invasion of [[Timur]], who established the [[Timurid Empire]] in 1370.

In the early 16th century, [[Babur]] arrived from [[Fergana]] and captured Kabul from the [[Arghun dynasty]]. In 1526, he invaded [[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi]] in India to replace the [[Lodi dynasty]] with the [[Mughal Empire]]. Between the 16th and 18th century, the [[Khanate of Bukhara]], [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]], and Mughals ruled parts of the territory. Before the 19th century, the northwestern area of Afghanistan was referred to by the regional name [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. Two of the four capitals of Khorasan ([[Herat]] and [[Balkh]]) are now located in Afghanistan, while the regions of [[Kandahar Province|Kandahar]], [[Zabul Province|Zabulistan]], Ghazni, Kabulistan, and [[name of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] formed the [[frontier]] between Khorasan and [[Hindustan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EI&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cJQ3AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |chapter=Khurasan |title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam |page=55 |quote=In pre-Islamic and early Islamic times, the term &quot;Khurassan&quot; frequently had a much wider denotation, covering also parts of what are now Soviet Central Asia and Afghanistan |publisher=Brill |year=2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209231141/https://books.google.com/books?id=cJQ3AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |archivedate=9 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Routledge&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Travels in Asia and Africa, 1325–1354 |last1=Ibn Battuta |edition=reprint, illustrated |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-34473-9 |page=416 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zKqn_CWTxYEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA180#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405002013/https://books.google.com/books?id=zKqn_CWTxYEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA180 |archivedate=5 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Firishta&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://persian.packhum.org/persian/pf?file=80201016&amp;ct=199 |title=The History of India |volume=6 |chapter=Chapter 200: Translation of the Introduction to Firishta's History |page=8 |accessdate=22 August 2010 |author =[[Firishta|Muhammad Qasim Hindu Shah]] |others=Sir H.

The Afghan Empire was under threat in the early 19th century by the [[Qajar dynasty|Persians]] in the west and the [[Sikh Empire]] in the east. Fateh Khan, leader of the [[Barakzai dynasty|Barakzai tribe]], had installed 21 of his brothers in positions of power throughout the empire. After his death, they rebelled and divided up the provinces of the empire between themselves.

In 1893, [[Mortimer Durand]] made Amir Abdur Rahman Khan sign a controversial agreement in which the ethnic [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] and [[Baloch people|Baloch]] territories were divided by the [[Durand Line]]. This was a standard [[divide and rule]] policy of the British and would lead to strained relations, especially with the later new state of Pakistan.
[[File:Zahir Shah of Afghanistan in 1930s-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mohammed Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]], the last king of Afghanistan, who reigned from 1933 to 1973.]]
After the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] and the signing of the [[Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919|Treaty of Rawalpindi]] on 19 August 1919, King [[Amānullāh Khān|Amanullah Khan]] declared Afghanistan a [[sovereign state|sovereign]] and fully [[independence|independent state]]. He moved to end his country's traditional isolation by establishing diplomatic relations with the international community and, following a 1927–28 tour of Europe and [[Turkey]], introduced several reforms intended to modernize his nation. A key force behind these reforms was [[Mahmud Tarzi]], an ardent supporter of the education of women. He fought for Article 68 of Afghanistan's 1923 [[constitution of Afghanistan|constitution]], which made elementary education compulsory. The institution of [[slavery]] was abolished in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | year = 1976| volume = Volume 25| encyclopedia = [[Encyclopedia Americana]]|publisher=Americana Corporation | page = 24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the reforms that were actually put in place, such as the abolition of the traditional [[burqa]] for women and the opening of a number of co-educational schools, quickly alienated many tribal and religious leaders. Faced with overwhelming armed opposition, Amanullah Khan was forced to abdicate in January 1929 after Kabul fell to rebel forces led by [[Habibullah Kalakani]]. Prince [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]], Amanullah's cousin, in turn defeated and killed Kalakani in November 1929, and was declared King Nadir Shah. He abandoned the reforms of Amanullah Khan in favor of a more gradual approach to modernisation but was assassinated in 1933 by [[Abdul Khaliq Hazara (assassin)|Abdul Khaliq]], a fifteen-year-old [[Hazara people|Hazara]] student.

[[Mohammed Zahir Shah]], Nadir Shah's 19-year-old son, succeeded to the throne and reigned from 1933 to 1973. Until 1946, Zahir Shah ruled with the assistance of his uncle, who held the post of [[Prime Minister of Afghanistan|Prime Minister]] and continued the policies of Nadir Shah. Another of Zahir Shah's uncles, [[Shah Mahmud Khan]], became Prime Minister in 1946 and began an experiment allowing greater political freedom, but reversed the policy when it went further than he expected. He was replaced in 1953 by [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]], the king's cousin and brother-in-law. Daoud Khan sought a closer relationship with the [[Soviet Union]] and a more distant one towards Pakistan. Afghanistan remained neutral and was neither a participant in [[World War II]] nor aligned with either power bloc in the [[Cold War]]. However, it was a beneficiary of the latter rivalry as both the Soviet Union and the United States vied for influence by building Afghanistan's main highways, airports, and other vital infrastructure. On per capita basis, Afghanistan received more Soviet [[development aid]] than any other country. In 1973, while King Zahir Shah was on an official overseas visit, Daoud Khan launched a bloodless coup and became the first [[President of Afghanistan]]. In the meantime, [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] got neighboring Pakistan involved in Afghanistan. Some experts suggest that Bhutto paved the way for the April 1978 [[Saur Revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowersox&quot;&gt;{{cite book

In April 1978, the communist [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA) seized power in Afghanistan in the [[Saur Revolution]]. Within months, opponents of the communist government launched an uprising in eastern Afghanistan that quickly expanded into a [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|civil war]] waged by guerrilla [[mujahideen]] against government forces countrywide. The Pakistani government provided these rebels with covert training centers, while the Soviet Union sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hussain |first=Rizwan |title=Pakistan And The Emergence Of Islamic Militancy In Afghanistan |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |year=2005 |pages=108–109 |isbn=978-0-7546-4434-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, increasing friction between the competing factions of the PDPA&amp;nbsp;— the dominant [[Khalq]] and the more moderate [[Parcham]]&amp;nbsp;— resulted in the dismissal of Parchami cabinet members and the arrest of Parchami military officers under the pretext of a Parchami coup.

In September 1979, [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]] was assassinated in a coup within the PDPA orchestrated by fellow Khalq member [[Hafizullah Amin]], who assumed the presidency. Distrusted by the Soviets, Amin was assassinated by Soviet special forces in December 1979.

===Civil war===
{{Main article|Afghan Civil War (1989–92)|Afghan Civil War (1992–96)}}
From 1989 until 1992, Najibullah's government tried to solve the ongoing civil war with economic and military aid, but without Soviet troops on the ground. Pakistan's spy agency ([[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]]), headed by [[Hamid Gul]] at the time, was interested in a trans-national Islamic revolution which would cover Pakistan, Afghanistan and Central Asia. For this purpose Pakistan masterminded an attack on [[Jalalabad]] for the Mujahideen to establish their own government in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/08/legacy-pakistan-loved-loathed-hamid-gul-150817114006616.html|title=The legacy of Pakistan's loved and loathed Hamid Gul|last=Nasir|first=Abbas|date=18 August 2015|work=Al-Jazeera|quote=His commitment to jihad – to an Islamic revolution transcending national boundaries, was such that he dreamed one day the &quot;green Islamic flag&quot; would flutter not just over Pakistan and Afghanistan, but also over territories represented by the (former Soviet Union) Central Asian republics. After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, as the director-general of the Pakistan's intelligence organisation, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) directorate, an impatient Gul wanted to establish a government of the so-called Mujahideen on Afghan soil. He then ordered an assault using non-state actors on Jalalabad, the first major urban centre across the [[Khyber Pass]] from Pakistan, with the aim capturing it and declaring it as the seat of the new administration.|access-date=4 January 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Najibullah tried to build support for his government by portraying his government as [[Islamism|Islamic]], and in the 1990 constitution the country officially became an [[Islamic state (government)|Islamic state]] and all references of communism were removed. Nevertheless, Najibullah did not win any significant support, and with the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991, he was left without foreign aid. This, coupled with the internal collapse of his government, led to his ousting from power in April 1992. After the fall of Najibullah's government in 1992, the post-communist [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] was established by the [[Peshawar Accord]], a peace and power-sharing agreement under which all the Afghan parties were united in April 1992, except for the Pakistani supported [[Hezb-e Islami]] of [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]. Hekmatyar started a bombardment campaign against the capital city Kabul, which marked the beginning of a [[Civil war in Afghanistan (1992–96)|new phase in the war]].&lt;ref&gt;Afghanistan Country Study Guide Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments by INB, p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2001, after the Taliban government was overthrown, the [[Afghan Interim Administration]] under  [[Hamid Karzai]] was formed, in which process the [[Taliban]] were typecast as 'the bad guys' and left out. The [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) was established by the [[UN Security Council]] to help assist the [[Presidency of Hamid Karzai|Karzai administration]] and provide basic security.&lt;ref&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-RES-1386(2001) |type=Resolution|body=Security Council|year=2001|resolution_number=1386 |accessdate=21 September 2007|date=31 May 2001}}&amp;nbsp;– ([[s:United Nations Security Council Resolution 1386|UNSCR 1386]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nato.usmission.gov/ |title=United States Mission to Afghanistan|publisher=Nato.usmission.gov|date= |accessdate=14 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021065112/http://nato.usmission.gov/ |archivedate=21 October 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taliban forces meanwhile began regrouping inside Pakistan, while more coalition troops entered Afghanistan and began rebuilding the war-torn country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Julie|last=Fossler |url=http://afghanistan.usaid.gov/en/index.aspx|title=USAID Afghanistan |publisher=Afghanistan.usaid.gov|accessdate=14 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017104214/http://afghanistan.usaid.gov/en/Index.aspx|archivedate=17 October 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afghanistan.gc.ca/canada-afghanistan/news-nouvelles/2010/2010_07_09.aspx?lang=eng |title=Canada's Engagement in Afghanistan: Backgrounder |publisher=Afghanistan.gc.ca |date=9 July 2010|accessdate=14 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uLgfkxeF?url=http://www.afghanistan.gc.ca/canada-afghanistan/news-nouvelles/2010/2010_07_09.aspx?lang=eng|archivedate=19 November 2010 |deadurl=yes|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after their fall from power, the Taliban began an [[Taliban insurgency|insurgency]] to regain control of Afghanistan. Over the next decade, ISAF and [[Afghan National Army|Afghan troops]] led many offensives against the Taliban, but failed to fully defeat them.

Meanwhile, the [[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghan government]] was able to build some democratic structures, and the country changed its name to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Attempts were made, often with the support of foreign donor countries, to improve the country's economy, healthcare, education, transport, and agriculture.

Afghanistan is an [[Islamic republic]] consisting of three branches, the executive, legislative, and judicial. The nation is led by President [[Ashraf Ghani]] with [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] and [[Sarwar Danish]] as vice presidents. [[Abdullah Abdullah]] serves as the chief executive officer (CEO). The [[National Assembly of Afghanistan|National Assembly]] is the legislature, a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] body having two chambers, the [[House of the People (Afghanistan)|House of the People]] and the [[House of Elders]]. The [[Afghan Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] is led by [[Chief Justice of Afghanistan|Chief Justice]] [[Said Yusuf Halem]], the former Deputy Minister of Justice for Legal Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supremecourt.gov.af/en/page/614/the-supreme-court-chief-justice-biography|title=The Supreme Court Chief Justice Biography|work=supremecourt.gov.af}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afghan-bios.info/index.php?option=com_afghanbios&amp;id=3158&amp;task=view&amp;total=3197&amp;start=1041&amp;Itemid=2|title=Database|work=afghan-bios.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Afghan presidential election, 2004|2004 Afghan presidential election]] was relatively peaceful, in which Hamid Karzai won in the first round with 55.4% of the votes. However, the [[Afghan presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential election]] was characterized by lack of security, low voter turnout, and widespread electoral fraud.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karzai Gets New Term as Afghan Runoff is Scrapped&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Cooper |first=Helene |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/world/asia/03afghan.html?_r=1&amp;hp |title=Karzai Gets New Term as Afghan Runoff is Scrapped |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2 November 2009 |accessdate=4 February 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511225923/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/world/asia/03afghan.html?_r=1&amp;hp |archivedate=11 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vote, along with elections for 420 [[Provinces of Afghanistan|provincial council]] seats, took place in August 2009, but remained unresolved during a lengthy period of vote counting and fraud investigation.

Two months later, under international pressure, a second round run-off vote between Karzai and remaining challenger [[Abdullah Abdullah|Abdullah]] was announced, but a few days later Abdullah announced that he would not participate in 7 November run-off because his demands for changes in the electoral commission had not been met. The next day, officials of the election commission cancelled the run-off and declared Hamid Karzai as President for another five-year term.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karzai Gets New Term as Afghan Runoff is Scrapped&quot; /&gt;

The [[Afghan presidential election, 2014|2014 presidential election]] ended with Ashraf Ghani winning by 56.44% votes.

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main article|Provinces of Afghanistan|Districts of Afghanistan}}
Afghanistan is administratively divided into 34 provinces (''[[wilayah|wilayats]]''), with each province having its own capital and a provincial administration. The provinces are further divided into about 398 smaller provincial districts, each of which normally covers a city or a number of villages. Each district is represented by a district governor.

The [[list of current governors of Afghanistan|provincial governors]] are appointed by the [[President of Afghanistan]] and the district governors are selected by the provincial governors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/09/world/asia/for-afghan-officials-prospect-of-death-comes-with-territory.html|title=For Afghan Officials, Prospect of Death Comes With Territory|last=Ahmed|first=Azam|date=2012-12-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-07|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The provincial governors are representatives of the central government in Kabul and are responsible for all administrative and formal issues within their provinces. There are also provincial councils that are elected through direct and general elections for a period of four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iec.org.af/eng/content.php?id=5&amp;cnid=24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827204439/http://www.iec.org.af/eng/content.php?id=5&amp;cnid=24 |archivedate=27 August 2010 |title=Explaining Elections, Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan |publisher=Iec.org.af |date=9 October 2004 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The functions of provincial councils are to take part in provincial development planning and to participate in the monitoring and appraisal of other provincial governance institutions.

According to article 140 of the constitution and the presidential decree on electoral law, mayors of cities should be elected through free and direct elections for a four-year term. However, due to huge election costs, mayoral and municipal elections have never been held. Instead, mayors have been appointed by the government. In the capital city of Kabul, the mayor is appointed by the President of Afghanistan.

The following is a list of all the 34 provinces in alphabetical order:

The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Afghanistan)|Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] is in charge of maintaining the [[foreign relations of Afghanistan]]. The state has been a member of the United Nations since 1946. It enjoys strong economic relations with a number of [[NATO]] and allied states, particularly the [[Afghanistan–United States relations|United States]], [[Afghanistan–United Kingdom relations|United Kingdom]], [[Afghanistan–Germany relations|Germany]] and [[Afghanistan–Turkey relations|Turkey]]. In 2012, the United States designated Afghanistan as a [[major non-NATO ally]] and created the [[U.S.–Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement]]. Afghanistan also has friendly diplomatic relations with neighboring [[Afghanistan–Pakistan relations|Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan–Iran relations|Iran]], [[Foreign relations of Turkmenistan#Afghanistan|Turkmenistan]], [[Foreign relations of Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan]], [[Afghanistan–Tajikistan relations|Tajikistan]], and [[Afghanistan–China relations|China]], and with regional states such as [[Afghanistan–India relations|India]], [[Afghanistan–Bangladesh relations|Bangladesh]], [[Foreign relations of Nepal|Nepal]], [[Foreign relations of Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]], [[Afghanistan–Russia relations|Russia]], the [[Afghanistan–United Arab Emirates relations|UAE]], Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Egypt, [[Afghanistan–Japan relations|Japan]], and [[Afghanistan–South Korea relations|South Korea]]. It continues to develop diplomatic relations with other countries around the world.

[[United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan]] (UNAMA) was established in 2002 under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1401]] in order to help the country recover from decades of war. Today, a number of NATO member states deploy about 38,000 troops in Afghanistan as part of the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/mounting-death-toll-afghan-troops-us-general-200602525.html|title=Mounting death toll for Afghan troops: US general|date=5 November 2014|work=Yahoo News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main purpose is to [[NATO Training Mission-Afghanistan|train]] the [[Afghan National Security Forces]] (ANSF). The [[Afghan Armed Forces]] are under the [[Ministry of Defense (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Defense]], which includes the [[Afghan National Army]] (ANA) and the [[Afghan Air Force]] (AAF). The ANA is divided into 6 major [[Corps]], with the [[201st Corps (Afghanistan)|201st Selab (&quot;Flood&quot;)]] in Kabul followed by the 203rd in Gardez, [[205th Corps|205th Atul (&quot;Hero&quot;)]] in Kandahar, 207th in [[Herat]], 209th in [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], and the 215th in [[Lashkar Gah]]. The ANA also has a [[ANA Commando Brigade|commando brigade]], which was established in 2007. The [[Afghan Defense University]] (ADU) houses various educational establishments for the Afghan Armed Forces, including the [[National Military Academy of Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Glasch|first1=Mike|title=USACE TAA employee named top engineer|url=https://www.army.mil/article/156986/USACE_TAA_employee_named_top_engineer|website=Army.mil|publisher=US Army|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ANP trucks in Kunar.jpg|thumb|[[Afghan National Police]] (ANP) in [[Kunar Province]]]]
The [[National Directorate of Security]] (NDS) is the nation's domestic [[intelligence agency]], which operates similar to that of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS). The [[Afghan National Police]] (ANP) is under the [[Ministry of the Interior (Afghanistan)|Ministry of the Interior]] and serves as a single [[law enforcement in Afghanistan|law enforcement agency]] all across the country. The [[Afghan National Civil Order Police]] is the main branch of the ANP, which is divided into five Brigades, each commanded by a Brigadier General. These brigades are stationed in Kabul, [[Gardez]], [[Kandahar]], [[Herat]], and [[Mazar-i-Sharif]]. Every province has an appointed provincial [[Chief of Police]] who is responsible for [[law enforcement]] throughout the province.

All parts of Afghanistan are considered dangerous due to militant activities. Hundreds of Afghan police are [[list of Afghan security forces fatality reports in Afghanistan|killed]] in the line of duty each year. Kidnapping and robberies are also reported. The [[Afghan Border Police]] (ABP) are responsible for protecting the nation's airports and borders, especially the disputed [[Durand Line]] border, which is often used by members of criminal organizations and terrorists for their illegal activities. A report in 2011 suggested that up to 3 million people were involved in the illegal drug business in Afghanistan. Attacks on government employees may be ordered by powerful mafia groups who reside inside and outside the country.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Drugs from Afghanistan are exported to neighboring countries and then to other countries. The [[Ministry of Counter Narcotics (Afghanistan)|Afghan Ministry of Counter Narcotics]] is tasked to deal with these issues by bringing to justice major drug traffickers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mcn.gov.af/en Ministry of Counter Narcotics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328013458/http://mcn.gov.af/en |date=28 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Air transport in Afghanistan is provided by the national carrier, [[Ariana Afghan Airlines]] (AAA), and by private companies such as [[Afghan Jet International]], [[East Horizon Airlines]], [[Kam Air]], [[Pamir Airways]], and [[Safi Airways]]. Airlines from a number of countries also provide flights in and out of the country. These include [[Air India]], [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], [[Gulf Air]], [[Iran Aseman Airlines]], [[Pakistan International Airlines]], and [[Turkish Airlines]].

The country has four international airports: [[Hamid Karzai International Airport]] (formerly Kabul International Airport), [[Kandahar International Airport]], [[Herat International Airport]], and [[Mazar-e Sharif International Airport]]. There are also around a dozen domestic airports with flights to Kabul and other major cities.

Newer automobiles have recently become more widely available after the rebuilding of roads and highways. They are imported from the [[United Arab Emirates]] through Pakistan and Iran. {{as of|2012}}, vehicles more than 10 years old are banned from being imported into the country. The development of the nation's road network is a major boost for the economy due to trade with neighboring countries. Postal services in Afghanistan are provided by the publicly owned [[Afghan Post]] and private companies such as [[FedEx]], [[DHL Express|DHL]], and others.

The top universities in Afghanistan are the [[American University of Afghanistan]] (AUAF) followed by [[Kabul University]] (KU), both of which are located in Kabul. The [[National Military Academy of Afghanistan]], modeled after the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point, is a four-year military development institution dedicated to graduating officers for the [[Afghan Armed Forces]]. The [[Afghan Defense University]] was constructed near [[Qargha Reservoir|Qargha]] in Kabul. Major universities outside of Kabul include [[Kandahar University]] in the south, [[Herat University]] in the northwest, [[Balkh University]] and [[Kunduz University]] in the north, [[Nangarhar University]] and [[Khost University]] in the east. The United States is building six faculties of education and five provincial teacher training colleges around the country, two large secondary schools in Kabul, and one school in Jalalabad.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAID-Education&quot; /&gt;

The literacy rate of the entire population is 38.2% (males 52% and females 24.2%).&lt;ref name=&quot;Factbook&quot;/&gt; In 2010, the United States began establishing a number of Lincoln learning centers in Afghanistan. They are set up to serve as programming platforms offering English language classes, library facilities, programming venues, [[Internet in Afghanistan|internet]] connectivity, and educational and other counseling services. A goal of the program is to reach at least 4,000 Afghan citizens per month per location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://photos.state.gov/libraries/afghanistan/231771/PDFs/RFP-Lincoln-Learning-Centers.pdf |format=PDF |title=Management and Establishment of Lincoln Learning Centers in Afghanistan |accessdate=19 May 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726162255/http://photos.state.gov/libraries/afghanistan/231771/PDFs/RFP-Lincoln-Learning-Centers.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://waronterrornews.typepad.com/home/2010/09/ghazni-gov-lincoln-learning-center.html |title=Ghazni governor signs memorandum for Lincoln Learning Center&amp;nbsp;– War On Terror News |publisher=Waronterrornews.typepad.com |date=22 September 2010 |accessdate=4 February 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231002648/http://waronterrornews.typepad.com/home/2010/09/ghazni-gov-lincoln-learning-center.html |archivedate=31 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Afghan National Security Forces are provided with mandatory literacy courses.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogeneratedmil&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.army.mil/article/59541/Rising_literacy_in_Afghanistan_ensures_transition/ |title=Rising literacy in Afghanistan ensures transition |publisher=Army.mil |date= |accessdate=4 February 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209021825/http://www.army.mil/article/59541/Rising_literacy_in_Afghanistan_ensures_transition/|archivedate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, [[Baghch-e-Simsim]] (based on the American [[Sesame Street]]) serves as a means to attract Afghan children into learning.

== Culture ==
{{Culture of Afghanistan}}
{{Main article|Culture of Afghanistan}}
Afghanistan is mostly a tribal society with different regions of the country having its own [[subculture]]. Their history is traced back to at least the time of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 500 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoC&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf |title=Country Profile: Afghanistan |work= |publisher=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]] on Afghanistan |date=August 2008 |accessdate=16 August 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408085103/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf|archivedate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the southern and eastern region, the people live according to the [[Pashtun culture]] by following [[Pashtunwali]] (Pashtun way).&lt;ref&gt;US Library of Congress: Afghanistan&amp;nbsp;– [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0037) Ethnic Groups (''Pashtun'')]&lt;/ref&gt; The Pashtuns (and Baloch) are largely connected to the culture of South Asia. The remaining Afghans are culturally [[Persianization|Persian]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]]. Some non-Pashtuns who live in proximity with Pashtuns have adopted Pashtunwali in a process called [[Pashtunization]], while some Pashtuns have been [[Persianization|Persianized]]. Those who have lived in Pakistan and Iran over the last 30 years have been further influenced by the cultures of those neighboring nations.
[[File:Tribal and religious leaders in southern Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Men wearing traditional [[Pashtun dress|Afghan dress]] in the southern city of [[Kandahar]]]]

Afghans are regarded with mingled apprehension and condescension, for their high regard for personal honor, for their tribe loyalty and for their readiness to use force to settle disputes. As tribal warfare and internecine feuding has been one of their chief occupations since time immemorial, this individualistic trait has made it difficult for foreigners to conquer them. One writer considers the tribal system to be the best way of organizing large groups of people in a country that is geographically difficult, and in a society that, from a materialistic point of view, has an uncomplicated lifestyle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathcote&quot;&gt;Heathcote, Tony (1980, 2003) &quot;The Afghan Wars 1839–1919&quot;, Sellmount Staplehurst.&lt;/ref&gt; There are various [[ethnic groups in Afghanistan|Afghan tribes]], and an estimated 2–3 million [[Kochi people|nomads]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=76794 Afghanistan: Kuchi nomads seek a better deal]&quot;.

The nation has a complex history that has survived either in its current cultures or in the form of various languages and monuments. However, many of its historic monuments have been damaged in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;G.V. Brandolini. ''Afghanistan [[cultural heritage]]''. Orizzonte terra, [[Bergamo]]. 2007. p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The two famous [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]] were destroyed by the Taliban, who regarded them as [[idolatry|idolatrous]].

Other historical places include the cities of [[Herat]], [[Kandahar]], [[Ghazni]], [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], and [[Zaranj]]. The [[Minaret of Jam]] in the [[Hari River, Afghanistan|Hari River]] valley is a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage site]]. A cloak reputedly worn by Islam's prophet [[Muhammad]] is kept inside the [[Shrine of the Cloak]] in Kandahar, a city founded by [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] and the first capital of Afghanistan. The [[citadel of Herat|citadel of Alexander]] in the western city of Herat has been renovated in recent years and is a popular attraction for tourists. In the north of the country is the [[Shrine of Ali]], believed by many to be the location where [[Ali]] was buried. The [[National Museum of Afghanistan]] is located in Kabul.

Classic [[Persian literature|Persian]] and [[Pashto literature and poetry|Pashto poetry]] plays an important role in the Afghan culture. [[Poetry of Afghanistan|Poetry]] has always been one of the major educational pillars in the region, to the level that it has integrated itself into culture. Some notable poets include [[Rumi]], [[Rabi'a Balkhi]], [[Sanai]], [[Jami]], [[Khushal Khan Khattak]], [[Rahman Baba]], [[Khalilullah Khalili]], and [[Parween Pazhwak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afghan-web.com/culture/poetry/cpoets.html |title=Classical Dari and Pashto Poets |publisher=Afghan-web.com |date= |accessdate=4 February 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006084545/http://www.afghan-web.com/culture/poetry/cpoets.html|archivedate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TOLOnews Studio .jpg|thumb|Studio of [[TOLOnews]] in Kabul]]
Afghanistan has around 150 [[List of radio stations in Afghanistan|radio stations]] and over 50 television stations, which includes the state-owned [[RTA TV]] and various private channels such as [[Tolo TV]] and [[Shamshad TV]].

[[Voice of America]], [[BBC World Service|BBC]], and [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (RFE/RL) broadcast in both of Afghanistan's official languages.

Since 2002, press restrictions have been gradually relaxed and private media diversified.

In 2008, [[Reporters Without Borders]] ranked the media environment as 156 out of 173 countries, with the 1st being the most free.

The city of Kabul has been home to many musicians who were masters of both traditional and modern [[Music of Afghanistan|Afghan music]]. Traditional music is especially popular during the [[Nowruz]] (New Year) and [[Afghan Independence Day|National Independence Day]] celebrations. [[Ahmad Zahir]], [[Nashenas]], [[Mohammad Hussain Sarahang|Ustad Sarahang]], [[Abdul Rahim Sarban|Sarban]], [[Ubaidullah Jan]], [[Farhad Darya]], and [[Naghma]] are some of the notable Afghan musicians, but there are many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afghanland.com/entertainment/music/bio.html |title=Artist Biographies |publisher=Afghanland.com |accessdate=17 October 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809214750/http://www.afghanland.com/entertainment/music/bio.html |archivedate=9 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghans have long been accustomed to watching Indian [[Bollywood]] films and listening to its [[filmi]] songs. Many Bollywood film stars have roots in Afghanistan, including [[Salman Khan]], [[Saif Ali Khan]], [[Shah Rukh Khan]] (SRK), [[Aamir Khan]], [[Feroz Khan (Indian actor)|Feroz Khan]], [[Kader Khan]], [[Naseeruddin Shah]], [[Zarine Khan]], [[Celina Jaitly]], and a number of others.

[[File:Ahmad Faisal - football - A.jpg|thumb|The [[Afghanistan national football team]] (in red uniforms) before its first win over [[India national football team|India]] (in blue) during the [[2011 SAFF Championship]].]]
Afghanistan's sports teams are increasingly celebrating titles at international events.
