He was an outspoken critic of the [[Soviet Union]] and [[communism]] and helped to raise global awareness of its [[Gulag]] forced labor camp system.  He was allowed to publish only one work in the Soviet Union, ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]'' (1962), in the periodical ''[[Novy Mir]]''. After this he had to publish in the West, most notably ''[[Cancer Ward]]'' (1968), ''[[August 1914 (novel)|August 1914]]'' (1971), and ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' (1973).  Solzhenitsyn was awarded the 1970 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]  &quot;for the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of Russian literature&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Noble&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1970/ |title=Nobel Prize in Literature 1970|publisher=Nobel Foundation | accessdate =17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Solzhenitsyn was afraid to go to [[Stockholm]] to receive his award for fear that he would not be allowed to reenter. He was eventually expelled from the Soviet Union in 1974, but returned to Russia in 1994 after [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the state's dissolution]].

==Biography==

===Early years===
Solzhenitsyn was born in [[Kislovodsk]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]] (now in [[Stavropol Krai]], Russia). His mother, Taisiya Zakharovna (née Shcherbak) was of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] descent.&lt;ref name = RFLSolUKma /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.segodnya.ua/news/12049583.html | script-title=ru:Александр Солженицын: человек и архипелаг – Мир Кризис Світ | language = Russian | trans_title = Alexander Solzhenitsyn: A man and Archipelago – World Crisis Svet | place = [[Ukraine|UA]] | publisher = Segodnya | date = 2 December 2009 | accessdate = 14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father had risen from humble beginnings to become a wealthy landowner, acquiring a large estate in the [[Kuban]] region in the northern foothills of the [[Caucasus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scammell|Scammell]], p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; During World War I, Taisiya went to Moscow to study. While there she met and married Isaakiy Solzhenitsyn, a young officer in the [[Imperial Russian Army]] of [[Cossack]] origins and fellow native of the Caucasus region. The family background of his parents is vividly brought to life in the opening chapters of ''August 1914'', and in the later ''[[The Red Wheel|Red Wheel]]'' novels.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scammell|Scammell]], pp. 26–30&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, Taisia became pregnant with Aleksandr.  On 15 June, shortly after her pregnancy was confirmed, Isaakiy was killed in a hunting accident.  Aleksandr was raised by his widowed mother and aunt in lowly circumstances.  His earliest years coincided with the [[Russian Civil War]]. By 1930 the family property had been turned into a [[kolkhoz|collective farm]]. Later, Solzhenitsyn recalled that his mother had fought for survival and that they had to keep his father's background in the old Imperial Army a secret.  His educated mother (who never remarried) encouraged his literary and scientific learnings and raised him in the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] faith;&lt;ref&gt;O'Neil, Patrick M. (2004) ''Great world writers: 20th century'', p. 1400. Marshall Cavendish, {{ISBN|0-7614-7478-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scammell|Scammell]], pp. 25–59&lt;/ref&gt; she died in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scammell|Scammell]], p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1936, Solzhenitsyn began developing the characters and concepts for a planned epic work on [[World War I]] and the [[Russian Revolution]]. This eventually led to the novel ''August 1914'' – some of the chapters he wrote then still survive.{{citation needed| date= May 2011}} Solzhenitsyn studied mathematics at [[Rostov State University]]. At the same time he took correspondence courses from the Moscow Institute of Philosophy, Literature and History, at this time heavily ideological in scope.  As he himself makes clear, he did not question the state ideology or the superiority of the Soviet Union until he spent time in the camps.{{Citation needed |date=November 2011}}

===World War II===
During the war Solzhenitsyn served as the commander of a [[sound-ranging]] battery in the [[Red Army]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scammell|Scammell]], p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; was involved in major action at the front, and twice decorated.  He was awarded the [[Order of the Red Star]] on 8 July 1944 for sound-ranging two German artillery batteries and adjusting counterbattery fire onto them, resulting in their destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pamyat-naroda.ru/heroes/podvig-chelovek_nagrazhdenie19998084/|title=Документ о награде :: Солженицын Александр Исаевич, Орден Красной Звезды|website=pamyat-naroda.ru|language=Russian|trans-title=Award document : Solzhenitsyn Aleksandr Isayevich, Order of the Red Star|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of writings published late in his life, including the early uncompleted novel ''Love the Revolution!'', chronicles his wartime experience and his growing doubts about the moral foundations of the Soviet regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Solzhenitsyn | first = Aleksandr Isaevich | title = Протеревши глаза: сборник (Proterevshi glaza: sbornik) | language = Russian | trans_title = Proterevshi eyes: compilation | place = Moscow | publisher =  Nash dom; L'Age d'Homme | year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While serving as an artillery officer in [[East Prussia]], Solzhenitsyn witnessed [[Soviet war crimes#Germany|war crimes against local German civilians]] by Soviet military personnel. The noncombatants and the elderly were robbed of their meager possessions and [[Mass rape of German women by Soviet Red Army|women and girls were gang-raped to death]]. A few years later, in the forced labor camp, he memorized a poem entitled &quot;[[Prussian Nights]]&quot; about these incidents. In this poem, which describes the gang-rape of a [[Poles|Polish]] woman whom the [[Red Army]] soldiers mistakenly thought to be a German, the first-person narrator comments on the events with sarcasm and refers to the responsibility of official Soviet writers like [[Ilya Ehrenburg]].

In ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'', Solzhenitsyn wrote, &quot;There is nothing that so assists the awakening of omniscience within us as insistent thoughts about one's own transgressions, errors, mistakes. After the difficult cycles of such ponderings over many years, whenever I mentioned the heartlessness of our highest-ranking bureaucrats, the cruelty of our executioners, I remember myself in my Captain's shoulder boards and the forward march of my battery through East Prussia, enshrouded in fire, and I say: 'So were ''we'' any better?'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ericson, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imprisonment ===

In February 1945, while serving in [[East Prussia]], Solzhenitsyn was arrested by [[SMERSH]] for writing derogatory comments in private letters to a friend, Nikolai Vitkevich,&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn1-933859-57-1&quot;&gt;[[#Ericon2008|Ericson (2008)]] p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; about the conduct of the war by [[Joseph Stalin]], whom he called &quot;[[Khozyain]]&quot; (&quot;the boss&quot;), and &quot;Balabos&quot; ([[Yiddish dialects|Yiddish]] rendering of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''baal ha-bayit'' for &quot;master of the house&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Moody|Moody]], p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;
He was accused of anti-Soviet propaganda under [[Article 58]] paragraph 10 of the Soviet criminal code, and of &quot;founding a hostile organization&quot; under paragraph 11.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scammell|Scammell]], pp. 152–54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Solzhenitsyn was taken to the [[Lubyanka Building|Lubyanka]] prison in Moscow, where he was interrogated. On 9 May 1945, it was announced that Germany had surrendered and all of Moscow broke out in celebrations with fireworks and searchlights illuminating the sky to celebrate the victory in the Great Patriotic War as Russians call the war with Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Joseph '''Solzhenitsyn: A Soul in Exile''' San Francisco: Ignatius Press; page 87.&lt;/ref&gt;  From his cell in the Lubyanka, Solzhenitsyn remembered: &quot;Above the muzzle of our window, and from all the other cells of the Lubyanka, and from all the windows of the Moscow prisons, we too, former prisoners of war and former front-line soldiers, watched the Moscow heavens, patterned with fireworks and crisscrossed with beams of searchlights. There was no rejoicing in our cells and no hugs and no kisses for us. That victory was not ours&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Joseph '''Solzhenitsyn: A Soul in Exile''' San Francisco: Ignatius Press; page 87.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 July 1945, he was sentenced in his absence by [[Special Council of the NKVD]] to an eight-year term in a [[labour camp]].  This was the normal sentence for most crimes under Article 58 at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Moody|Moody]], p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The first part of Solzhenitsyn's sentence was served in several different work camps; the &quot;middle phase,&quot; as he later referred to it, was spent in a ''[[sharashka]]'' (i.e., a special scientific research facility run by Ministry of State Security), where he met [[Lev Kopelev]], upon whom he based the character of ''Lev Rubin'' in his book ''[[The First Circle]]'', published in a self-censored or &quot;distorted&quot; version in the West in 1968 (an English translation of the full version was eventually published by Harper Perennial in October 2009).&lt;ref&gt;

In 1950, he was sent to a &quot;Special Camp&quot; for political prisoners.  During his imprisonment at the camp in the town of [[Ekibastuz]] in Kazakhstan, he worked as a miner, bricklayer, and foundry foreman. His experiences at Ekibastuz formed the basis for the book ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]''.  One of his fellow political prisoners, [[Ion Moraru]], remembers that Solzhenitsyn spent some of his time at Ekibastuz writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.romanism.net/tag/sabia-dreptatii |title=Organizatia anti-sovietica &quot;Sabia Dreptatii&quot; |language=Romanian |trans_title=Anti-Soviet organization &quot;Sword of Justice&quot; |publisher=Romanism |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809121325/http://romanism.ro/tag/sabia-dreptatii |archivedate=2011-08-09}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
While there Solzhenitsyn had a tumor removed. His cancer was not diagnosed at the time.

In March 1953, after his sentence ended, Solzhenitsyn was sent to internal exile for life at Birlik&lt;ref&gt;According to 9th MGB order of December 27, 1952 № 9 / 2-41731.&lt;/ref&gt;''',''' a village in Baidibek district of South Kazakhstan region of Kazakhstan (Kok-terek rural district).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lgPwzq0M9lkC&amp;pg=PT44&amp;lpg=PT44&amp;dq=solzhenitsyn+betpak+dala&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HlwdlMiHJv&amp;sig=P8w5tQfsO_QI6EDqetmhdHXKo2E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi98r6W8onSAhUHExoKHYhxCt8Q6AEIKTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=betpak%20dala&amp;f=false|title=Solzhenitsyn: A Soul in Exile|last=Pearce|first=Joseph|publisher=Ignatius Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=they were being exiled &quot;in perpetuity&quot; to the district of Kok-Terek|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%91%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA_(%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BE%D0%BD)|title=Birlik, Russian Wikipedia|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2017}} His undiagnosed cancer spread until, by the end of the year, he was close to death. In 1954, he was permitted to be treated in a hospital in [[Tashkent]], where his tumor went into remission. His experiences there became the basis of his novel ''[[Cancer Ward]]'' and also found an echo in the short story &quot;The Right Hand.&quot; It was during this decade of imprisonment and exile that Solzhenitsyn abandoned [[Marxism]] and developed the philosophical and religious positions of his later life, gradually becoming a philosophically-minded Eastern Orthodox Christian as a result of his experience in prison and the camps.&lt;ref&gt;

He repented for some of his actions as a Red Army captain, and in prison compared himself to the perpetrators of the Gulag: &quot;I remember myself in my captain's shoulder boards and the forward march of my battery through East Prussia, enshrouded in fire, and I say: 'So were we any better?'&quot; His transformation is described at some length in the fourth part of ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' (&quot;The Soul and Barbed Wire&quot;). The narrative poem ''The Trail'' (written without benefit of pen or paper in prison and camps between 1947 and 1952) and the 28 poems composed in prison, forced-labour camp, and exile also provide crucial material for understanding Solzhenitsyn's intellectual and spiritual odyssey during this period. These &quot;early&quot; works, largely unknown in the West, were published for the first time in Russian in 1999 and excerpted in English in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;

===Marriages and children===
On 7 April 1940, while at the university, Solzhenitsyn married Natalia Alekseevna Reshetovskaya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Terras | first = Victor | year = 1985 | title = Handbook of Russian Literature | page = 436 | publisher = Yale University Press | ISBN = 0-300-04868-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had just over a year of married life before he went into the army, then to the Gulag. They divorced in 1952, a year before his release, because wives of Gulag prisoners faced loss of work or residence permits. After the end of his internal exile, they remarried in 1957,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scammell|Scammell]], p. 366&lt;/ref&gt; divorcing a second time in 1972.

The following year Solzhenitsyn married his second wife, Natalia Dmitrievna Svetlova, a mathematician who had a son from a brief prior marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Cook | first = Bernard A | title = Europe Since 1945: An Encyclopedia | page = 1161 | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | year = 2001 | ISBN = 0-8153-4058-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and Svetlova (born 1939) had three sons: Yermolai (1970), [[Ignat Solzhenitsyn|Ignat]] (1972), and Stepan (1973).&lt;ref&gt;Aikman, David. ''Great Souls: Six Who Changed a Century'', pp. 172–73. Lexington Books, 2003, {{ISBN|0-7391-0438-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solzhenitsyn's adopted son Dmitri Turin died on March 18, 1994, age 32 in Cavendish, Vermont, shortly before he could return with his father to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-03-24/news/9403240049_1_turin-cavendish-solzhenitsyn|website=Orlando Sentinel|title=Dmitri Turin|date=1994-03-24|accessdate=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After prison===
After [[Khrushchev's Secret Speech]] in 1956, Solzhenitsyn was freed from exile and [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|exonerated]]. Following his return from exile, Solzhenitsyn was, while teaching at a secondary school during the day, spending his nights secretly engaged in writing. In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech he wrote that &quot;during all the years until 1961, not only was I convinced I should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime, but, also, I scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything I had written because I feared this would become known.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/literature/laureates/1970/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041204155242/http://nobelprize.org/literature/laureates/1970/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 4 December 2004 |year=1970 |title=Laureates |work=Literature |publisher=Nobel prize |accessdate=14 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, aged 42, he approached [[Aleksandr Tvardovsky]], a poet and the chief editor of the ''Novyi Mir'' magazine, with the manuscript of ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]''. It was published in edited form in 1962, with the explicit approval of [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who defended it at the presidium of the Politburo hearing on whether to allow its publication, and added: &quot;There's a Stalinist in each of you; there's even a Stalinist in me. We must root out this evil.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Benno | first = Peter | year = 1965 | chapter = The Political Aspect | editor1-first = Max | editor1-last = Hayward | editor2-first = Edward L | editor2-last = Crowley | title = Soviet Literature in the 1960s | place = London | page = 191}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book quickly sold out and became an instant hit.{{Citation needed|date= July 2011}} In the 1960s, while he was publicly known to be writing ''Cancer Ward'', he was simultaneously writing ''The Gulag Archipelago''. During Khrushchev's tenure, ''One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' was studied in schools in the Soviet Union, as were three more short works of Solzhenitsyn's, including his acclaimed short story ''[[Matryona's Place|Matryona's Home]]'', published in 1963. These would be the last of his works published in the Soviet Union until 1990.

''One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' brought the Soviet system of prison labour to the attention of the West.  It caused as much of a sensation in the Soviet Union as it did in the West—not only by its striking realism and candor, but also because it was the first major piece of Soviet literature since the 1920s on a politically charged theme, written by a non-party member, indeed a man who had been to Siberia for &quot;libelous speech&quot; about the leaders, and yet its publication had been officially permitted. In this sense, the publication of Solzhenitsyn's story was an almost unheard of instance of free, unrestrained discussion of politics through literature. Most Soviet readers realized this, but after Khrushchev had been ousted from power in 1964, the time for such raw exposing works came to an end.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Later years in the Soviet Union===

Solzhenitsyn made an unsuccessful attempt, with the help of Tvardovsky, to get his novel, ''Cancer Ward'', legally published in the Soviet Union. This had to get the approval of the [[USSR Union of Writers|Union of Writers]]. Though some there appreciated it, the work ultimately was denied publication unless it was to be revised and cleaned of suspect statements and anti-Soviet insinuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = [[The Oak and the Calf]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Krushchev's removal in 1964, the cultural climate again became more repressive. Publishing of Solzhenitsyn's work quickly stopped; as a writer, he became a [[non-person]], and, by 1965, the [[KGB]] had seized some of his papers, including the manuscript of ''The First Circle''. Meanwhile, Solzhenitsyn continued to secretly and feverishly work upon the most well-known of all his writings, ''The Gulag Archipelago''.  The seizing of his novel manuscript first made him desperate and frightened, but gradually he realized that it had set him free from the pretenses and trappings of being an &quot;officially acclaimed&quot; writer, something which had come close to second nature, but which was becoming increasingly irrelevant.

After the KGB had confiscated Solzhenitsyn's materials in Moscow, during 1965–67 the preparatory drafts of ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' were turned into finished typescript in hiding at his friends' homes in [[Estonia]]. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn had befriended [[Arnold Susi]], a lawyer and former Estonian Minister of Education in a [[Lubyanka Building|Lubyanka]] Prison cell. After completion, Solzhenitsyn's original handwritten script was kept hidden from the KGB in Estonia by Arnold Susi's daughter Heli Susi until the collapse of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Art of the Baltics: The Struggle for Freedom of Artistic Expression Under the Soviets, 1945–1991|last1 =Rosenfeld|first1 =Alla| first2=Norton T | last2 = Dodge|year= 2001 | publisher = Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-3042-0|pages=55, 134 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=r73fmcC5itkC&amp;pg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Invisible Allies| last = Solzhenitsyn| first = Aleksandr I | year = 1995| publisher= Basic Books| isbn = 978-1-887178-42-6 | pages =46–64 | chapter = The Estonians|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5yYBZ35HPo4C&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 Solzhenitsyn was expelled from the Union of Writers. In 1970, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. He could not receive the prize personally in [[Stockholm]] at that time, since he was afraid he would not be let back into the Soviet Union. Instead, it was suggested he should receive the prize in a special ceremony at the Swedish embassy in Moscow.  The Swedish government refused to accept this solution because such a ceremony and the ensuing media coverage might upset the Soviet Union and damage Swedish-Soviet relations. Instead, Solzhenitsyn received his prize at the 1974 ceremony after he had been expelled from the Soviet Union.

''The Gulag Archipelago'' was composed from 1958 to 1967.  It was a three-volume, seven part work on the Soviet prison camp system (Solzhenitsyn never had all seven parts of the work in front of him at one time). The book was based upon Solzhenitsyn's own experience as well as the testimony of 256&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Gulag Archipelago | chapter = Ekaterinburg: U-Faktoriia}}&lt;/ref&gt; former prisoners and Solzhenitsyn's own research into the history of the Russian penal system.  It discussed the system's origins from the founding of the Communist regime, with [[Vladimir Lenin]] having responsibility, detailing interrogation procedures, prisoner transports, prison camp culture, [[Kengir uprising|prisoner uprisings and revolts]], and the practice of [[Exile|internal exile]]. ''The Gulag Archipelago'' has sold over thirty million copies in thirty-five languages.

According to fellow gulag historian [[Anne Applebaum]], ''The Gulag Archipelago'''s rich and varied authorial voice, its unique weaving together of personal testimony, philosophical analysis, and historical investigation, and its unrelenting indictment of communist ideology made ''The Gulag Archipelago'' one of the most impactful books of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Anne | last = Applebaum | year = 2007 | contribution = Foreword | publisher = Harper | series = Perennial Modern Classics | title = The Gulag Archipelago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though ''The Gulag Archipelago'' was not published in the Soviet Union, it was extensively criticized by the Party-controlled Soviet press. An editorial in ''[[Pravda]]'' on 14 January 1974 accused Solzhenitsyn of supporting &quot;Hitlerites&quot; and making &quot;excuses for the crimes of the [[Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia|Vlasovites]] and [[Stepan Bandera|Bandera]] gangs.&quot; According to the editorial, Solzhenitsyn was &quot;choking with pathological hatred for the country where he was born and grew up, for the socialist system, and for Soviet people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Current Digest of the Soviet Press | volume = 26 | number = 2 | year = 1974 | page = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, he was sheltered by the cellist [[Mstislav Rostropovich]], who suffered considerably for his support of Solzhenitsyn and was eventually forced into exile himself.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In August 1971 the KGB allegedly made an attempt to assassinate Solzhenitsyn using an unknown biological agent (most likely [[ricin]]) with an experimental gel-based delivery method. The attempt left him seriously ill but was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= The First Directorate |last = Kalugin |first = Oleg | year = 1994 |publisher= Diane |page= 180| isbn= 0-312-11426-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport | last = Carus | first = Seth | year = 1998 | title= Bioterrorism and Biocrimes | url = https://fas.org/irp/threat/cbw/carus.pdf | publisher = Federation of American Scientists |page=84 | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expulsion from the Soviet Union===

In a discussion of its options in dealing with Solzhenitsyn the members of the Politburo considered his arrest and imprisonment and his expulsion to a socialist country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bukovskyarchive.wordpress.com/2016/07/05/7-january-1974-pb/ The Bukovsky Archives, 7 January 1974.]&lt;/ref&gt; Guided by KGB chief [[Yury Andropov]], and with encouraging statements from [[Willy Brandt]], it was decided to deport the writer directly to [[West Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://bukovskyarchive.wordpress.com/2016/07/05/7-february-1974-350-a-ov/ The Bukovsky Archives, 7 February 1974, 350 A/ov.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the West===
[[File:Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn 1974b.jpg|thumb|left|340px|Solzhenitsyn in [[Cologne]], West Germany, in 1974]]
On 12 February 1974, Solzhenitsyn was arrested and deported the next day from the Soviet Union to [[Frankfurt]], West Germany and stripped of his Soviet [[citizenship]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT20080804&quot;/&gt; The KGB had found the manuscript for the first part of ''The Gulag Archipelago'' and, less than a week later, [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]] suffered reprisals for his support of Solzhenitsyn.{{Citation needed |date=February 2016}} U.S. military attaché [[William Odom]] managed to smuggle out a large portion of Solzhenitsyn's archive, including the author's membership card for the [[Writers' Union]] and Second World War military citations; Solzhenitsyn subsequently paid tribute to Odom's role in his memoir ''Invisible Allies'' (1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Patterson | first = Michael Robert | url = http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/weodom.htm | title= William Eldridge Odom, Lieutenant General, United States Army | publisher=Arlington cemetery.net |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In West Germany, Solzhenitsyn lived in [[Heinrich Böll]]'s house in [[Cologne]]. He then moved to [[Zürich]], Switzerland before [[Stanford University]] invited him to stay in the United States to &quot;facilitate your work, and to accommodate you and your family.&quot; He stayed on the 11th floor of the [[Hoover Tower]], part of the [[Hoover Institution]], before moving to [[Cavendish, Vermont|Cavendish]], Vermont in 1976. He was given an honorary Literary Degree from [[Harvard University]] in 1978 and on Thursday, 8 June 1978 he gave his Commencement Address&lt;ref name=harvard&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/document/document060603.asp |title=A World Split Apart |series=Harvard Class Day Exercises |date=8 June 1978 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030608093915/http://www.nationalreview.com/document/document060603.asp |archivedate=8 June 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; condemning, among other things, [[anthropocentrism]] in modern western culture.{{Citation needed | date = February 2014}}

Over the next 17 years, Solzhenitsyn worked on his dramatized history of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], ''[[The Red Wheel]]''. By 1992, four &quot;knots&quot; (parts) had been completed and he had also written several shorter works.

Despite spending almost two decades in the United States, Solzhenitsyn did not become fluent in spoken English. He had, however, been reading English-language literature since his teens, encouraged by his mother.{{Citation needed | date= August 2008}} More importantly, he resented the idea of becoming a media star and of tempering his ideas or ways of talking in order to suit television. Solzhenitsyn's warnings about the dangers of Communist aggression and the weakening of the moral fiber of the West were generally well received in Western conservative circles (e.g. Ford administration staffers [[Richard Cheney]] and [[Donald Rumsfeld]] advocated on Solzhenitsyn's behalf for him to speak directly to President [[Gerald Ford]] about the Soviet threat),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 =Mann | first1 = James | last2 = Mann | first2 = Jim | title= Rise of the Vulcans: The History of Bush's War Cabinet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wcljXYTZVnUC|year=2004|publisher=Penguin |isbn = 978-0-14-303489-6 | pages= 64–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; prior to and alongside the tougher foreign policy pursued by US President [[Ronald Reagan]]. At the same time, liberals and [[secularism|secularists]] became increasingly critical of what they perceived as his [[reactionary]] preference for [[Russian nationalism]] and the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] religion.

Solzhenitsyn also harshly criticised what he saw as the ugliness and spiritual vapidity of the dominant [[popular culture|pop culture]] of the modern West, including television and much of popular music: &quot;...the human soul longs for things higher, warmer, and purer than those offered by today's mass living habits... by TV stupor and by intolerable music.&quot; Despite his criticism of the &quot;weakness&quot; of the West, Solzhenitsyn always made clear that he admired the political liberty which was one of the enduring strengths of western democratic societies. In a major speech delivered to the International Academy of Philosophy in Liechtenstein on 14 September 1993, Solzhenitsyn implored the West not to &quot;lose sight of its own values, its historically unique stability of civic life under the rule of law—a hard-won stability which grants independence and space to every private citizen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ericson2009|Ericson (2009)]] p. 599&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of writings, speeches, and interviews after his return to his native Russia in 1994, Solzhenitsyn spoke about his admiration for the local self-government he had witnessed first hand in Switzerland and New England.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Russia in Collapse&quot; in [[#Ericson2009|Ericson (2009)]] pp. 480–1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Cavendish Farewell&quot; in [[#Ericson2009|Ericson (2009)]] pp. 606–07&lt;/ref&gt; He &quot;praised 'the sensible and sure process of [[grassroots democracy]], in which the local population solves most of its problems on its own, not waiting for the decisions of higher authorities.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Bill Kauffman| last = Kauffman | first = William 'Bill' | date = 19 December 2005 | url = http://www.amconmag.com/article/2005/dec/19/00016/ | title = Free Vermont | newspaper = [[The American Conservative]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Solzhenitsyn's patriotism was inward-looking. He called for Russia to &quot;renounce all mad fantasies of foreign conquest and begin the peaceful long, long long period of recuperation,&quot; as he put it in a 1979 BBC interview with Janis Sapiets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Solzhenitsyn | first = Aleksandr I | title = East and West | place = New York | publisher = Harper | series = Perennial Library | year = 1980 | page = 182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Russia===
[[File:A solzhenitsin.JPG|thumb|Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn looks out from a train, in [[Vladivostok]], summer 1994, before departing on a journey across Russia. Solzhenitsyn returned to Russia after nearly 20 years in [[exile]].]]
In 1990, his Soviet citizenship was restored, and, in 1994, he returned to Russia with his wife, Natalia, who had become a United States citizen. Their sons stayed behind in the United States (later, his oldest son Yermolai returned to Russia to work for the Moscow office of a leading management consultancy firm). From then until his death, he lived with his wife in a [[dacha]] in [[Troitse-Lykovo]] (Троице-Лыково) in west Moscow between the dachas once occupied by Soviet leaders [[Mikhail Suslov]] and [[Konstantin Chernenko]]. A staunch believer in traditional Russian culture, Solzhenitsyn expressed his disillusionment with post-Soviet Russia in works such as ''Rebuilding Russia'', and called for the establishment of a strong presidential republic balanced by vigorous institutions of local self-government. The latter would remain his major political theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Solzhenitsyn | first = Aleksandr Isaevich | title = Rebuilding Russia | place = New York | publisher = Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux | year = 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solzhenitsyn also published eight two-part short stories, a series of contemplative &quot;miniatures&quot; or prose poems, a literary memoir on his years in the West (''The Grain Between the Millstones''), among many other writings. Once back in Russia Solzhenitsyn hosted a television talk show program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/14/world/now-on-moscow-tv-heeere-s-aleksandr.html|title=Now on Moscow TV, Heeere's Aleksandr!|date=14 April 1995|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its eventual format was Solzhenitsyn delivering a 15-minute monologue twice a month; it was discontinued in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-09-26/news/mn-50166_1_talk-show|title=Russian TV Pulls the Plug on Solzhenitsyn's Biting Talk Show|work=latimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Solzhenitsyn died of heart failure near Moscow on 3 August 2008, at the age of 89.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT20080804&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/04/books/04solzhenitsyn.html | title= Solzhenitsyn, Literary Giant Who Defied Soviets, Dies at 89|last1 =Kaufman|first1 =Michael T | last2= Barnard | first2 = Anne|date= 4 August 2008 | work=The New York Times|page=1|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7540038.stm |title= Alexander Solzhenitsyn dies at 89|publisher= BBC | work = News |date=3 August 2008 |accessdate=3 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A burial service was held at [[Donskoy Monastery]], Moscow, on Wednesday, 6 August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://en.rian.ru/culture/20080804/115673613.html | title =Russia to pay tribute to Solzhenitsyn| publisher= RIA Novosti| date= 4 August 2008| accessdate= 5 August 2008 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080809023835/http://en.rian.ru/culture/20080804/115673613.html | archivedate = 9 August 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried the same day in the monastery in a spot he had chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7544265.stm| title = Solzhenitsyn is buried in Moscow| work = News | publisher=BBC|date=6 August 2008|accessdate=6 August 2008 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090115143356/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7544265.stm| archivedate=15 January 2009| deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian and world leaders paid tribute to Solzhenitsyn following his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/culture/20080804/115673613.html|title=Russia to pay tribute to Solzhenitsyn|accessdate=6 August 2008|publisher=RIA Novosti| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080809023835/http://en.rian.ru/culture/20080804/115673613.html | archivedate= 9 August 2008 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alexander Solzhenitsyn in Moscow, December 1998.jpg|thumb|Solzhenitsyn in 1998]]
The most complete 30-volume edition of Solzhenitsyn's collected works is soon to be published in Russia{{when|date=October 2015}}. The presentation of its first three volumes, already in print, recently took place in Moscow{{when|date=October 2015}}.  Unhappy with the economic and social malaise of the [[Boris Yeltsin|Yeltsin era]], Solzhenitsyn expressed his admiration for [[President of Russia|President]] [[Vladimir Putin]]'s attempts to restore a sense of national pride. Putin signed a [[Decree of the President of Russia|decree]] conferring on Solzhenitsyn the [[State Prize of the Russian Federation]] for his humanitarian work&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:ru:Указ Президента РФ от 05.06.2007 № 699]]&lt;/ref&gt; and personally visited the writer at his home on 12 June 2007 to present him with the award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ria.ru/society/20070612/67097422.html Путин лично поздравил Солженицына с вручением госпремии] (retrieved January 12, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Yermolai Solzhenitsyn has translated some of his father's works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lehmann-Haupt|first1=Christopher|title=BOOKS OF THE TIMES; Two Contradictory Views of Russia|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/01/home/18610.html|website=The New York Times on the Web: Books|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stepan Solzhenitsyn lives and works in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mckinsey Russia|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/global-locations/europe-and-middleeast/russia/en/our-people/stephan-solzhenitsyn|website=Mckinsey and Company|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ignat Solzhenitsyn]] is the music director of [[The Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia]].

==KGB operations against Solzhenitsyn==
On 8 August 1971, Solzhenitsyn was [[Poison laboratory of the Soviet secret services|poisoned]] with what was later determined to be [[ricin]], but survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Toxic Politics: The Secret History of the Kremlin's Poison Laboratory--from the Special Cabinet to the Death of Litvinenko|last=Vaksberg|first=Arkadiĭ|date=2011|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0-313-38747-0|location=Santa Barbara, Calif|pages=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| edition = Rev. and updated| publisher = Ignatius Press| isbn = 978-1-58617-496-5| last = Pearce| first = Joseph| title = Solzhenitsyn: A Soul in Exile| location = San Francisco| date = 2011|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 September 1974, [[Yuri Andropov]] approved a large-scale operation to discredit Solzhenitsyn and his family and cut his communications with [[Soviet dissidents]]. The plan was jointly approved by [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], [[Philipp Bobkov]], and Grigorenko (heads of First, Second and Fifth KGB Directorates).&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrew&quot;&gt;{{Citation | author1-link = Christopher Andrew (historian)| last1 = Andrew | first1 = Christopher | author2-link = Vasili Mitrokhin| last2 = Mitrokhin | first2 = Vasili | year = 2000 | title = The [[Mitrokhin Archive]]: The KGB in Europe and the West | publisher = Gardners Books | ISBN = 0-14-028487-7 | pages = 416–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The residencies in [[Geneva]], [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Rome]] and other European cities participated in the operation. Among other active measures, at least three [[StB]] agents became translators and secretaries of Solzhenitsyn (one of them translated the poem [[Prussian Nights]]), keeping KGB informed regarding all contacts by Solzhenitsyn.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrew&quot; /&gt;

The KGB sponsored a series of hostile books about Solzhenitsyn, most notably a &quot;memoir published under the name of his first wife, Natalia Reshetovskaya, but probably mostly composed by Service&quot;, according to historian [[Christopher Andrew (historian)|Christopher Andrew]].&lt;ref name= Andrew /&gt; Andropov also gave an order to create &quot;an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion between Pauk{{Efn | KGB gave Solzhenitsyn the code name ''Pauk'', which means &quot;spider&quot; in Russian.}} and the people around him&quot; by feeding him rumors that everyone in his surrounding was a KGB agent and deceiving him in all possible ways.  Among other things, the writer constantly received envelopes with photographs of car accidents, brain surgery and other frightening illustrations. After the KGB harassment in Zürich, Solzhenitsyn settled in [[Cavendish, Vermont|Cavendish]], Vermont, reduced communications with others and surrounded his property with a [[barbed wire]] fence.  His influence and [[moral authority]] for the West diminished as he became increasingly isolated and critical of Western individualism. KGB and [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] experts finally concluded that he alienated American listeners by his &quot;reactionary views and intransigent criticism of the US way of life&quot;, so no further [[active measures]] would be required.&lt;ref name = Andrew /&gt;

==Views on history and politics==

=== {{anchor|GodForgotten}} &quot;Men have forgotten God&quot;===
Regarding atheism, Solzhenitsyn declared:
{{quote|text=Over a half century ago, while I was still a child, I recall hearing a number of old people offer the following explanation for the great disasters that had befallen Russia: &quot;Men have forgotten God; that's why all this has happened.&quot; Since then I have spent well-nigh 50 years working on the history of our revolution; in the process I have read hundreds of books, collected hundreds of personal testimonies, and have already contributed eight volumes of my own toward the effort of clearing away the rubble left by that upheaval. But if I were asked today to formulate as concisely as possible the main cause of the ruinous revolution that swallowed up some 60 million of our people, I could not put it more accurately than to repeat: &quot;Men have forgotten God; that's why all this has happened.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ericson, Edward E. Jr. (October 1985) &quot;Solzhenitsyn – Voice from the Gulag,&quot; ''Eternity'', pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===On Russia and the Jews===
In his 1974 essay &quot;Repentance and Self-Limitation in the Life of Nations&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ericson2009|Ericson (2009)]] pp. 527–55&lt;/ref&gt; Solzhenitsyn called for Russian Gentiles and Jews alike to take moral responsibility for the &quot;renegades&quot; from both communities who enthusiastically created a [[Marxist-Leninist]] [[police state]] after the [[October Revolution]]. In a November 13, 1985 review of Solzhenitsyn's novel ''August 1914'' in the ''[[New York Times]]'', [[Jewish-American]] historian [[Richard Pipes]] commented: &quot;Every culture has its own brand of anti-Semitism.  In Solzhenitsyn's case, it's not racial. It has nothing to do with blood. He's certainly not a racist; the question is fundamentally religious and cultural. He bears some resemblance to [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], who was a fervent Christian and patriot and a rabid anti-Semite. Solzhenitsyn is unquestionably in the grip of the Russian extreme right's view of the Revolution, which is that it was [[Jewish Bolshevism|the doing of the Jews]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]] p. 490&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jewish]] [[Holocaust]] survivor [[Elie Wiesel]] denied this claim and insisted that Solzhenitsyn was not an anti-Semite: &quot;He is too intelligent, too honest, too courageous, too great a writer.&quot; He added he wished Solzhenitsyn were more sensitive to Jewish suffering, but believed his insensitivity to be unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]] p. 491&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1998 book ''Russia in Collapse'', Solzhenitsyn excoriated the Russian extreme right's obsession with anti-Semitic and anti-Masonic [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ericson2009|Ericson (2009)]] p. 496.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, however, Solzhenitsyn published a two-volume work on the history of Russian-Jewish relations (''[[Two Hundred Years Together]]'' 2001, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jan/25/russia.books | title = Solzhenitsyn breaks last taboo of the revolution | first = Nick Paton | last = Walsh | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | place = UK | date = 25 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bestseller in Russia, the book triggered renewed accusations of [[anti-Semitism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3763/is_200609/ai_n18622003 |title=Dimensional Spaces in Alexander Solzhenitsyn's ''Two Hundred Years Together'' |work=Canadian Slavonic Papers |publisher=Find articles |date=2 June 2009 |accessdate=14 February 2010 |first=Zinaida |last=Gimpelevich |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805141955/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3763/is_200609/ai_n18622003/ |archivedate= 5 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://berkovich-zametki.com/2006/Zametki/Nomer6/VOstrovsky1.htm | title = В Островский (V Ostrovsky) | language = Russian | trans_title = In Ostrovsky |publisher= Berkovich zametki |accessdate= 14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Khanan | first = Vladimir | url = http://www.sunround.com/club/22/133_chanan.htm | script-title=ru:И в Израиле – с Наклоном | language = Russian | trans_title = And in Israel – with Naklonom |publisher= Sun round | accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=young /&gt;

The controversy was fueled by the similarities between ''Two Hundred Years Together'' and an anti-Semitic essay titled &quot;Jews in the USSR and in the Future Russia&quot;. According to professor of Jewish history [[Semyon Reznik]], textological analyses of the essay indicate Solzhenitsyn's authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.vestnik.com/issues/2003/0611/win/reznik.htm | script-title=ru:Семён Резник: Лебедь Белая И Шесть Пудов Еврейского Жира | language = Russian | trans_title = Semyon Reznik: White Swan And Six Pudov Jewish Fat |publisher=Vestnik |accessdate= 14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solzhenitsyn responded by saying that the essay was written using manuscripts stolen from him by the KGB forty years before. They were then carefully edited as part of the Soviet State's &quot;[[active measures]]&quot; against him.&lt;ref name=young&gt;{{Citation | last = Young | first = Cathy |date=May 2004 | url = http://www.reason.com/news/show/29113.html | title = Traditional Prejudices.

===On Post-Soviet Russia===
In some of his later political writings, such as ''Rebuilding Russia'' (1990) and ''Russia in Collapse'' (1998), Solzhenitsyn criticized the oligarchic excesses of the new Russian 'democracy,' while opposing any nostalgia for Soviet Communism. He defended moderate and self-critical patriotism (as opposed to [[Radical nationalism in Russia|extreme nationalism]]), urged local self-government to a free Russia, and expressed concerns for the fate of the 25 million ethnic Russians in the &quot;[[near abroad]]&quot; of the former Soviet Union.

In a 2007 interview with ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', Solzhenitsyn expressed disappointment that the &quot;conflation of 'Soviet' and 'Russian', against which I spoke so often in the 1970s, has not passed away in the West, in the ex-socialist countries, or in the former Soviet republics. The elder political generation in communist countries is not ready for repentance, while the new generation is only too happy to voice grievances and level accusations, with present-day Moscow [as] a convenient target. They behave as if they heroically liberated themselves and lead a new life now, while Moscow has remained communist. Nevertheless, I dare [to] hope that this unhealthy phase will soon be over, that all the peoples who have lived through communism will understand that communism is to blame for the bitter pages of their history.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Solzhenitsyn 2007&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/spiegel-interview-with-alexander-solzhenitsyn-i-am-not-afraid-of-death-a-496211.html | type = interview | first = Aleksandr I | last = Solzhenitsyn | title = I Am Not Afraid of Death | newspaper = [[Der Spiegel]] | issue = 30 | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The West===
Delivering the commencement address at [[Harvard University]] in 1978, he called the United States spiritually weak and mired in vulgar [[materialism]]. Americans, he said, speaking in Russian through a translator, suffered from a &quot;decline in courage&quot; and a &quot;lack of manliness.&quot; Few were willing to die for their ideals, he said. He condemned both the United States government and American society for its &quot;hasty&quot; capitulation in the [[Vietnam War]]. He criticized the country's music as intolerable and attacked its [[freedom of the press|unfettered press]], accusing it of violations of privacy. He said that the West erred in measuring other civilizations by its own model.  While faulting Soviet society for denying fair legal treatment of people, he also faulted the West for being too legalistic: &quot;A society which is based on the letter of the law and never reaches any higher is taking very scarce advantage of the high level of human possibilities.&quot; Solzhenitsyn also argued that the West erred in &quot;denying [Russian culture's] autonomous character and therefore never understood it&quot;.&lt;ref name=harvard /&gt;

===Communism, Russia, and nationalism===
Solzhenitsyn emphasized the significantly more oppressive character of the Soviet [[totalitarian]] regime, in comparison to the [[Russian Empire]] of the [[House of Romanov]]. He asserted that Imperial Russia did not practice any real censorship in the style of the Soviet [[Glavlit]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beaconforfreedom.org/about_database/russia.html &quot;A brief history of censorship in Russia in 19th and 20th century&quot;] ''Beacon for Freedom'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216181044/http://www.beaconforfreedom.org/about_database/russia.html |date=16 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that political prisoners typically were not forced into [[labor camps]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Gentes | first = Andrew | year = 2005 | url = http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/eserv/UQ:8015/katorga.pdf | chapter = Katorga: Penal Labor and Tsarist Siberia | title = The Siberian Saga: A History of Russia's Wild East | editor-first = Eva-Maria | editor-last = Stolberg | place = Frankfurt am Main | publisher = Peter Lang | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the number of political prisoners and exiles was only one ten-thousandth of those in the Soviet Union. He noted that the Tsar's secret police, or [[Okhrana]], was only present in the three largest cities, and not at all in the [[Imperial Russian Army]].{{Citation needed|date = July 2011}}

Shortly before his return to Russia, Solzhenitsyn delivered a speech in [[Lucs-sur-Boulogne]] to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the [[Vendée Uprising]]. During his speech, Solzhenitsyn compared Lenin's [[Bolshevik]]s with the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobin Party]] during the [[French Revolution]]. He also compared the Vendean rebels with the Russian, Ukrainian, and Cossack peasants who rebelled against the Bolsheviks, saying that both were destroyed mercilessly by revolutionary despotism. However, he commented that, while the French [[Reign of Terror]] ended with the [[Thermidorian reaction|toppling of the Jacobins]] and the execution of [[Maximilien Robespierre]], its Soviet equivalent continued to accelerate until the [[Khrushchev thaw]] of the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;''The Solzhenitsyn Reader: New and Essential Writings 1947–2005'', (2008), [[ISI Books]]. pp. 602–05.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Solzhenitsyn, Russians were not the ruling nation in the Soviet Union. He believed that all the traditional culture of all ethnic groups were equally oppressed in favor of an atheism and Marxist-Leninism. Russian culture was even more repressed than any other culture in the Soviet Union, since the regime was more afraid of ethnic uprisings among Russian Christians than among any other ethnicity. Therefore, Solzhenitsyn argued, [[Russian nationalism]] and the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] should not be regarded as a threat by the West but rather as allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Russian Nationalism |first= David G | last= Rowley | journal = Journal of Contemporary History |volume=32 |issue=3 |year=1997 |pages=321–37 |jstor= 260964 | doi=10.1177/002200949703200303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;Rebuilding Russia,&quot; an essay first published in 1990 in ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' Solzhenitsyn urged Russia to grant independence to all the non-Slav republics, which he claimed were sapping the Russian nation and he called for the creation of a new Slavic state bringing together Russia, [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], and parts of [[Kazakhstan]] that he considered to be [[Russified]].&lt;ref name= RFLSolUKma&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.rferl.org/content/Solzhenitsyn_Leaves_Troubled_Legacy_Across_Former_Soviet_Union/1188876.html | title = Solzhenitsyn Leaves Troubled Legacy Across Former Soviet Union | newspaper = [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] | date = 6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Solzhenitsyn accused [[NATO]] of trying to bring Russia under its control; he claimed this was visual because of its &quot;ideological support for the '[[colour revolutions]]' and the paradoxical forcing of North Atlantic interests on Central Asia&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4953690.stm | title = Solzhenitsyn warns of Nato plot | newspaper = [[BBC News]] | date = 28 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an 2006 interview with ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' he stated &quot;This was especially painful in the case of Ukraine, a country whose closeness to Russia is defined by literally millions of family ties among our peoples, relatives living on different sides of the national border.  At one fell stroke, these families could be torn apart by a new dividing line, the border of a military bloc.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Solzhenitsyn 2007&quot;/&gt;

[[Daniel J. Mahoney]], however, has accused those who paint Solzhenitsyn as an uncritical adherent of Tsarism of &quot;traducing&quot; his real philosophy. Mahoney has written, &quot;...if one opens almost any page of Solzhenitsyn's 1994 essay &quot;The Russian Question&quot; at the End of the Twentieth Century&quot; one finds Solzhenitsyn attacking the cruelties and injustice of [[Serfdom in Russia|serfdom]], faulting Tsarist authorities for their blindness about the need for political liberty in Russia, and for their wasting of the nation's strength in unnecessary and counterproductive foreign adventures. Moreover, he attacks [[Pan-Slavism]], the idea that Russia had a mission to unite Slavic peoples and to come to the defense of the Orthodox wherever they were under threat, as a 'wretched idea'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Mahoney (2014), ''The Other Solzhenitsyn: Telling the Truth about a Misunderstood Writer and Thinker'', [[St. Augustine's Press]]. pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Holodomor===
Solzhenitsyn gave a speech to [[AFL–CIO]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on 30 June 1975, where he mentioned how the system created by [[Bolsheviks]] in 1917 caused dozens of problems in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seventy five&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/SolzhenitsynTheVoiceOfFreedom|title=Solzhenitsyn: The Voice of Freedom|author=Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn|work=AFL–CIO|date=30 June 1975|accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described how this system &quot;in time of peace, artificially created a famine, causing 6 million people to die in the Ukraine in 1932 and 1933.&quot; Following this, he stated that &quot;they died on the very edge of Europe. And Europe didn't even notice it. The world didn't even notice it—6 million people!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Seventy five&quot;/&gt; Solzhenitsyn opined on 2 April 2008 in ''[[Izvestia]]'' that the [[Holodomor|1930s famine in the Ukraine]] was no different from the [[Russian famine of 1921]] as both were caused by the ruthless robbery of peasants by Bolshevik grain procurements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solzh&quot;/&gt; He claimed that the &quot;provocatory shriek about a 'genocide' was started in the minds of Ukrainian chauvinists decades later, who are also viciously opposed to '[[Moskal]]s.'&quot; The writer cautioned that the genocidal claim has its chances to be accepted by the West due to the general western ignorance of Russian and Ukrainian history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solzh&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Alexander|last=Solzhenitsyn|authorlink=Alexander Solzhenitsyn|url=http://www.izvestia.ru/opinions/article3114723/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405034053/http://www.izvestia.ru/opinions/article3114723|archivedate=5 April 2008|script-title=ru:Поссорить родные народы??|work=[[Izvestia]]|language=Russian|date=2 April 2008|accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
Solzhenitsyn criticized the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] for not opening a new front against [[Nazi Germany]] in the west earlier in World War II. This resulted in Soviet domination and oppression of the nations of Eastern Europe. Solzhenitsyn claimed the Western democracies apparently cared little about how many died in the East, as long as they could end the war quickly and painlessly for themselves in the West.

===Vietnam War===
Once in the United States, Solzhenitsyn urged the United States to reconsider its attitude towards the [[Vietnam War]] (which had ended in April 1975).  In his commencement address at Harvard University in 1978,&lt;ref name=harvard /&gt; Solzhenitsyn alleged that many in the U.S. did not understand the [[Vietnam War]]. He rhetorically asked if the American [[Anti-War Movement]] ever realized the contemptuous laughter which, he said, their actions had always provoked among the elderly men in the Soviet [[Politburo]]. Solzhenitsyn also accused American anti-war activists of moral responsibility for the political repression that followed the [[Fall of Saigon]]: &quot;But members of the U.S. antiwar movement wound up being involved in the betrayal of [[Far East]]ern nations, in a [[Cambodian genocide|genocide]] and in the suffering today imposed on 30 million people there. Do those convinced [[Pacifism|pacifists]] hear the moans coming from there?&quot;&lt;ref name=harvard /&gt;

Solzhenitsyn's philosophy plays a key role in the 2012 film ''[[Cloud Atlas (film)|Cloud Atlas]]'', where a character previously kept ignorant and subservient is illegally educated, and is shown reading and quoting his works.&lt;ref name=&quot;illegally educated&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/synchronized-banality-cloud-atlas|title=Synchronized Banality: “Cloud Atlas”|first=Richard|last=Brody|date=1 November 2012|website=[[The New Yorker]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
