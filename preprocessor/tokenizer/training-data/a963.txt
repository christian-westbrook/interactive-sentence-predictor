The '''Africa Alphabet''' (also '''International African Alphabet''' or '''IAI alphabet''') was developed in 1928 under the lead of [[Diedrich Westermann]]. He developed it with a group of [[African studies|Africanists]] at the International Institute of African Languages and Cultures (later the [[International African Institute|IAI]]) in [[London]]. Its aim was to enable people to write all the [[African languages]] for practical and scientific purposes without the need of [[diacritic]]s. It is based on the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] with a few differences, such as ''j'' and ''y'', which instead have the same (consonant) sound values as in English.

This alphabet has influenced development of orthographies of many African languages (serving &quot;as the basis for the transcription&quot; of about 60, by one count&lt;ref&gt;Sow, Alfa I., and Mohamed H. Abdulaziz, &quot;Language and Social Change,&quot; Ch. 18 in Ali A. Mazrui (ed.) Africa Since 1935 (UNESCO General History of Africa, Vol. 8). University of California Press, 1993. P. 527.&lt;/ref&gt;), but not all, and discussions of harmonization of systems of transcription that led to, among other things, adoption of the [[African reference alphabet]].

The African Alphabet was used, with the International Phonetic Alphabet, as a basis for the [[World Orthography]].
