'''Alfred Bernhard Nobel''' ({{IPAc-en|n|oʊ|ˈ|b|ɛ|l}}; {{IPA-sv|ˈalfrɛd nʊˈbɛl|lang}} {{audio|sv-Alfred_Nobel.ogg|listen}}; 21 October 1833 – 10 December 1896) was a Swedish chemist, engineer, inventor, businessman, and philanthropist.

Known for inventing [[dynamite]], Nobel also owned [[Bofors]], which he had redirected from its previous role as primarily an iron and steel producer to a major manufacturer of cannon and other armaments. Nobel held 355 different patents, dynamite being the most famous. After reading a [[premature obituary]] which condemned him for profiting from the sales of arms, he bequeathed his fortune to institute the [[Nobel Prize]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;fin-assets&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Alfred Nobel's Fortune|url=http://nobelpeaceprize.org/en_GB/alfred-nobel/financial-assets/|publisher=The Norwegian Nobel Committee|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alfwill&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Alfred Nobel's Will|url=http://nobelpeaceprize.org/en_GB/alfred-nobel/testament/|publisher=The Norwegian Nobel Committee|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The synthetic element [[nobelium]] was named after him.&lt;ref name=&quot;nobelium1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Nobelium|url=http://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/102/nobelium|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His name also survives in modern-day companies such as [[Dynamit Nobel]] and [[AkzoNobel]], which are descendants of mergers with companies Nobel himself established.

==Life and career==
[[File:Alfred Nobel young.jpg|thumb|left|Alfred Nobel at a young age]]
Born in [[Stockholm]], Alfred Nobel was the third son of [[Immanuel Nobel]] (1801–1872), an inventor and engineer, and Carolina Andriette (Ahlsell) Nobel (1805–1889).{{r|Brit1}} The couple married in 1827 and had eight children. The family was impoverished, and only Alfred and his three brothers survived past childhood.{{r|Brit1}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Gale&quot;&gt;''Encyclopedia of Modern Europe: Europe 1789–1914: Encyclopedia of the Age of Industry and Empire'', &quot;Alfred Nobel&quot;, 2006 Thomson Gale.&lt;/ref&gt; Through his father, Alfred Nobel was a descendant of the Swedish scientist [[Olaus Rudbeck]] (1630–1702),&lt;ref&gt;Schück, Henrik, Ragnar Sohlman, Anders Österling, Carl Gustaf Bernhard, the Nobel Foundation and Wilhelm Odelberg, eds. Nobel: The Man and His Prizes. 1950. 3rd ed. Coordinating Ed., Wilhelm Odelberg. New York: American Elsevier Publishing Company, Inc., 1972, p. 14. {{ISBN|0-444-00117-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-444-00117-7}}. (Originally published in Swedish as Nobelprisen 50 år: forskare, diktare, fredskämpar.)&lt;/ref&gt; and in his turn the boy was interested in engineering, particularly explosives, learning the basic principles from his father at a young age. Alfred Nobel's interest in technology was inherited from his father, an alumnus of [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svantelindqvist.com/anobel_inventor.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Following various business failures, Nobel's father moved to [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1837 and grew successful there as a manufacturer of machine tools and explosives. He invented modern [[plywood]] and started work on the [[naval mine|torpedo]].&lt;ref name=MWMIH&gt;{{cite web|title=The Man Who Made It Happen — Alfred Nobel|url=http://www.3833.com/wbn_nobel_alfred_bernhard|publisher=3833|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1842, the family joined him in the city. Now prosperous, his parents were able to send Nobel to private tutors and the boy excelled in his studies, particularly in chemistry and languages, achieving fluency in [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].{{r|Brit1}} For 18 months, from 1841 to 1842, Nobel went to the only school he ever attended as a child, the Jacobs Apologistic School in Stockholm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gale&quot;/&gt;

As a young man, Nobel studied with chemist [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Zinin|Nikolai Zinin]]; then, in 1850, went to [[Paris]] to further the work. There he met [[Ascanio Sobrero]], who had invented [[nitroglycerin]] three years before. Sobrero strongly opposed the use of nitroglycerin, as it was unpredictable, exploding when subjected to heat or pressure. But Nobel became interested in finding a way to control and use nitroglycerin as a commercially usable explosive, as it had much more power than [[gunpowder]]. At age 18, he went to the United States for one year&lt;ref&gt;https://sok.riksarkivet.se/Sbl/Presentation.aspx?id=8143&lt;/ref&gt; to study chemistry, working for a short period under inventor [[John Ericsson]], who designed the [[American Civil War]] ironclad ''[[USS Monitor]]''. Nobel filed his first patent, an English patent for a [[gas meter]], in 1857, while his first Swedish patent, which he received in 1863, was on 'ways to prepare gunpowder'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gale&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carlisle, Rodney (2004). [https://books.google.com/books?id=pDbQVE3IdTcC&amp;pg=PA256 ''Scientific American Inventions and Discoveries''], p. 256. John Wiley &amp; Songs, Inc., New Jersey. {{ISBN|0-471-24410-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|Brit1}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Nobelprize&quot;/&gt;

The family factory produced armaments for the [[Crimean War]] (1853–1856), but had difficulty switching back to regular domestic production when the fighting ended and they filed for bankruptcy.{{r|Brit1}} In 1859, Nobel's father left his factory in the care of the second son, [[Ludvig Nobel]] (1831–1888), who greatly improved the business. Nobel and his parents returned to Sweden from Russia and Nobel devoted himself to the study of explosives, and especially to the safe manufacture and use of [[nitroglycerin]].  Nobel invented a detonator in 1863, and in 1865 designed the [[blasting cap]].{{r|Brit1}}

On 3 September 1864, a shed used for preparation of nitroglycerin exploded at the factory in [[Heleneborg]], Stockholm, killing five people, including Nobel's younger brother [[Emil Oskar Nobel|Emil]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gale&quot;/&gt; Dogged and unfazed by more minor accidents, Nobel went on to build further factories, focusing on improving the stability of the explosives he was developing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gale&quot;/&gt; Nobel invented [[dynamite]] in 1867, a substance easier and safer to handle than the more unstable [[nitroglycerin]]. Dynamite was patented in the US and the UK and was used extensively in mining and the building of transport networks internationally.{{r|Brit1}} In 1875 Nobel invented [[gelignite]], more stable and powerful than dynamite, and in 1887 patented [[ballistite]], a predecessor of [[cordite]].{{r|Brit1}}

Nobel was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1884, the same institution that would later select laureates for two of the Nobel prizes, and he received an [[honorary doctorate]] from [[Uppsala University]] in 1893.

[[File:Nobel's death mask.jpg|thumb|Alfred Nobel's [[death mask]], at Bjorkborn, Nobel's residence in [[Karlskoga]], Sweden.]]
Nobel's brothers Ludvig and Robert exploited oilfields along the [[Caspian Sea]] and became hugely rich in their own right. Nobel invested in these and amassed great wealth through the development of these new oil regions. During his life Nobel was issued 355 [[patent]]s internationally and by his death his business had established more than 90 armaments factories, despite his belief in pacifism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/nobel_alfred.shtml|title=Alfred Nobel (1833–1896)|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|Brit1}}

In 1888, the death of his brother Ludvig caused several newspapers to publish obituaries of Alfred in error. A French obituary stated &quot;Le marchand de la mort est mort&quot; ''(&quot;The merchant of death is dead&quot;)''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brit1&quot;/&gt;

==Death==

Accused of “high treason against France” for selling [[Ballistite]] to Italy, Nobel moved from Paris to [[Sanremo]], [[Italy]] in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nobel|first1=Alfred|title=Alfred Nobel's House in Paris|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/biographical/articles/malakoff/|website=Nobel Media AB|publisher=Nobel Media AB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Death&quot;/&gt; On December 10, 1896, Alfred Nobel succumbed to a lingering heart ailment, suffered a stroke, and died.&lt;ref name=&quot;Death&quot;/&gt; Unbeknownst to his family, friends or colleagues, he had left most of his wealth in trust, in order to fund the awards that would become known as the [[Nobel Prize]]s.{{r|Brit1}} He is buried in [[Norra begravningsplatsen]] in [[Stockholm]].

==Personal life==

Through baptism and confirmation Alfred Nobel was Lutheran and during his Paris years he regularly attended the [[Church of Sweden Abroad]], led by pastor [[Nathan Söderblom]], who would in 1930 also be the recipient of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Nobel of Peace Laureate Nathan Söderblom]]&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Nobel of Peace Laureates |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1930/soderblom-bio.html|date= March 2013|accessdate= 8 December 2013|quote= – For seven years, from 1894 to 1901, Söderblom preached in Paris, where his congregation included Alfred Nobel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;biphost&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Alfred Nobel, hans far och hans bröder |url=http://biphost.spray.se/john.rosen/an4a.htm|date= March 2013|accessdate= 9 December 2013|quote= (swe: Genom dop och konfirmation var Alfred Nobel lutheran -en: Alfred Nobel was through baptism and confirmation a Lutheran)}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he became an agnostic at youth and was an atheist later in life.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/biographical/articles/russia/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Evlanoff; Marjorie Fluor (1969).

Creations of Fire: Chemistry's Lively History from Alchemy to the Atomic Age. New York: Plenum, 1995. Print. &quot;But Nobel, both atheist and a socialist...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Nobel travelled for much of his business life, maintaining companies in various countries in Europe and North America and keeping a permanent home in Paris from 1873 to 1891.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gale&quot;/&gt; He remained a solitary character, given to periods of depression. {{r|Brit1}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alfred-Nobel|title=Alfred Nobel {{!}} Biography &amp; Facts|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Nobel remained unmarried, his biographers note that he had at least three loves. Nobel's first love was in Russia with a girl named Alexandra, who rejected his proposal. In 1876 [[Austria|Austro]]-[[Bohemia]]n [[Freifrau|Countess]] [[Bertha von Suttner|Bertha Kinsky]] became Alfred Nobel's secretary, but after only a brief stay she left him to marry her previous lover, Baron Arthur Gundaccar von Suttner. Though her personal contact with Alfred Nobel had been brief, she corresponded with him until his death in 1896, and it is believed that she was a major influence in his decision to include a peace prize among those prizes provided in his will. [[Bertha von Suttner]] was awarded the 1905 Nobel Peace prize, 'for her sincere peace activities'.{{Citation needed|date = November 2016}}

Nobel's third and longest-lasting relationship was with Sofie Hess from [[Vienna]], whom he met in 1876.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gale&quot;/&gt; The liaison lasted for 18 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gale&quot;/&gt;  After his death, according to his biographers Evlanoff, Fluor and Fant, Nobel's letters were locked within the Nobel Institute in Stockholm. They were released only in 1955, to be included with other biographical data.{{citation needed|date = November 2016}}

Despite the lack of formal secondary and tertiary level education, Nobel gained proficiency in six languages: [[Swedish language|Swedish]], French, Russian, English, German and [[Italian language|Italian]]. He also developed sufficient literary skill to write poetry in English. His ''[[Nemesis (Nobel play)|Nemesis]]'', a prose tragedy in four acts about [[Beatrice Cenci]], partly inspired by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s ''[[The Cenci]]'', was printed while he was dying. The entire stock except for three copies was destroyed immediately after his death, being regarded as scandalous and blasphemous. The first surviving edition (bilingual Swedish–[[Esperanto]]) was published in Sweden in 2003. The play has been translated into [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] via the Esperanto version and into French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred Nobel|title=Némésis: tragédie en quatre actes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VRUYPQAACAAJ|accessdate=19 August 2011|year=2008|publisher=Belles lettres|isbn=978-2-251-44342-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 it was published in Russia in another bilingual ([[Russian language|Russian]]–Esperanto) edition.{{citation needed|date = November 2016}}

Nobel found that when [[nitroglycerin]] was incorporated in an absorbent inert substance like ''kieselguhr'' ([[diatomaceous earth]]) it became safer and more convenient to handle, and this mixture he patented in 1867 as &quot;dynamite&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisholm 1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911 |inline=1 |wstitle=Nobel, Alfred Bernhard |volume=19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel demonstrated his explosive for the first time that year, at a quarry in [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]], [[Surrey]], England. In order to help reestablish his name and improve the image of his business from the earlier controversies associated with the dangerous explosives, Nobel had also considered naming the highly powerful substance &quot;Nobel's Safety Powder&quot;, but settled with Dynamite instead, referring to the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for &quot;power&quot; ({{lang|grc|δύναμις}}).

Nobel later combined nitroglycerin with various nitrocellulose compounds, similar to [[collodion]], but settled on a more efficient recipe combining another nitrate explosive, and obtained a transparent, jelly-like substance, which was a more powerful explosive than dynamite. '[[Gelignite]]', or blasting gelatin, as it was named, was patented in 1876; and was followed by a host of similar combinations, modified by the addition of potassium nitrate and various other substances.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisholm 1911&quot;/&gt; Gelignite was more stable, transportable and conveniently formed to fit into bored holes, like those used in drilling and mining, than the previously used compounds and was adopted as the standard technology for mining in the ''Age of Engineering'' bringing Nobel a great amount of financial success, though at a significant cost to his health. An offshoot of this research resulted in Nobel's invention of [[ballistite]], the precursor of many modern smokeless powder explosives and still used as a rocket propellant.

==Nobel Prizes==
{{Main|Nobel Prize}}

In 1888 Alfred's brother Ludvig died while visiting [[Cannes]] and a [[France|French]] newspaper erroneously published Alfred's [[List of premature obituaries|obituary]].{{r|Brit1}} It condemned him for his invention of dynamite and is said to have brought about his decision to leave a better legacy after his death.{{r|Brit1}}{{r|HistC}} The obituary stated, ''{{lang|fr|Le marchand de la mort est mort}}'' (&quot;The merchant of death is dead&quot;){{r|Brit1}} and went on to say, &quot;Dr. Alfred Nobel, who became rich by finding ways to kill more people faster than ever before, died yesterday.&quot;{{r|Nobel}} Alfred (who never had a wife or children) was disappointed with what he read and concerned with how he would be remembered.{{citation needed|date = November 2016}}

On 27 November 1895, at the [[Sweden|Swedish]]-[[Norway|Norwegian]] Club in Paris, Nobel signed his last will and testament and set aside the bulk of his estate to establish the [[Nobel Prize]]s, to be awarded annually without distinction of nationality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisholm 1911&quot;/&gt; After taxes and bequests to individuals, Nobel's will allocated 94% of his total assets, 31,225,000 [[Swedish kronor]], to establish the five Nobel Prizes. This converted to £1,687,837 (GBP) at the time.&lt;ref&gt;At exchange rate of 18.5:1 in SEK:GBP&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Håkan Lobell&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author= Lobell, Håkan |title= Historical Monetary and Financial Statistics for Sweden Exchange rates, prices, and wages, 1277–2008|publisher= S V E R I G E S R I K S B A N K|isbn=978-91-7092-124-7|year=2010|page=291|authorlink=#Håkan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Abrams7&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Abrams, Irwin|title= The Nobel Peace Prize and the Laureates|publisher= Watson Publishing International|isbn=0-88135-388-4|year=2001|page=7|authorlink=#Abrams}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|Fant 1991 327}} In 2012, the capital was worth around SEK 3.1 billion (USD 472 million, EUR 337 million), which is almost twice the amount of the initial capital, taking inflation into account.&lt;ref name=&quot;Håkan Lobell&quot;/&gt;

The first three of these prizes are awarded for eminence [[Nobel Prize in Physics|in physical science]], [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|in chemistry]] and [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|in medical science or physiology]]; the fourth is [[Nobel Prize for Literature|for literary work]] &quot;in an ideal direction&quot; and [[Nobel Peace Prize|the fifth prize]] is to be given to the person or society that renders the greatest service to the cause of international [[wikt:fraternity|fraternity]], in the suppression or reduction of standing armies, or in the establishment or furtherance of peace congresses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisholm 1911&quot;/&gt;

The formulation for the literary prize being given for a work &quot;in an ideal direction&quot; (''{{lang|sv|i idealisk riktning}}'' in Swedish), is cryptic and has caused much confusion. For many years, the Swedish Academy interpreted &quot;ideal&quot; as &quot;idealistic&quot; (''{{lang|sv|idealistisk}}'') and used it as a reason not to give the prize to important but less romantic authors, such as [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]]. This interpretation has since been revised, and the prize has been awarded to, for example, [[Dario Fo]] and [[José Saramago]], who do not belong to the camp of literary idealism.{{Citation needed|date = November 2016}}

There was room for interpretation by the bodies he had named for deciding on the physical sciences and chemistry prizes, given that he had not consulted them before making the will. In his one-page testament, he stipulated that the money go to discoveries or inventions in the physical sciences and to discoveries or improvements in chemistry. He had opened the door to technological awards, but had not left instructions on how to deal with the distinction between science and technology. Since the deciding bodies he had chosen were more concerned with the former, the prizes went to scientists more often than engineers, technicians or other inventors.{{citation needed|date = November 2016}}

In 2001, Alfred Nobel's great-great-nephew, Peter Nobel (b. 1931), asked the Bank of Sweden to differentiate its award to economists given &quot;in Alfred Nobel's memory&quot; from the five other awards. This request added to the controversy over whether the [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]] is actually a legitimate &quot;Nobel Prize&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=(Ntb-Afp) |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/fakta/nobel/article235455.ece |title=Alfred Nobels familie tar avstand fra økonomiprisen |publisher=Aftenposten.no |date= |accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monuments==
The ''Monument to Alfred Nobel'' ({{Lang-ru|Памятник Альфреду Нобелю}}, {{coord|59.960787|30.334905|dim:30_region:RU-LEN_type:landmark}}) in Saint Petersburg is located along the [[Bolshaya Nevka River]] on Petrogradskaya Embankment. It was dedicated in 1991 to mark the 90th anniversary of the first [[Nobel Prize]] presentation. Diplomat [http://www.cyclopaedia.info/wiki/Tomas-Bertelman Thomas Bertelman] and Professor [[Arkady Melua]] initiators of creation of the monument (1989). Professor A. Melua has provided funds for the establishment of the monument ([http://humanistica.ru/pages_en/news_nobeldv.htm J.S.Co. &quot;Humanistica&quot;], 1990–1991). The abstract metal sculpture was designed by local artists Sergey Alipov and Pavel Shevchenko, and appears to be an explosion or branches of a tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monument to Alfred Nobel|url=http://www.saint-petersburg.com/monuments/alfred-nobel/|publisher=Saint-Petersburg.com|accessdate=5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petrogradskaya Embankment is the street where the Nobel's family lived until 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lemmel|first1=Birgitta |title=Alfred Nobel – St. Petersburg, 1842–1863 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/biographical/articles/russia|publisher=Nobel Media AB |accessdate=5 July 2014|ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Criticism of Nobel focuses on his leading role in weapons manufacturing and sales, and some question his motives in creating his prizes, suggesting they were intended to improve his reputation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2011/01/alfred-nobel-was-also-known-as-the-merchant-of-death/ Article] by Daven Hiskey at ''Today I Found Out'' 2011-01-03&lt;/ref&gt;
