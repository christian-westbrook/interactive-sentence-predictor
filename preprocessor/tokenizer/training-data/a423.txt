'''Analysis''' is the process of breaking a [[complexity|complex topic]] or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. The technique has been applied in the study of [[mathematics]] and [[logic]] since before [[Aristotle]] (384–322 [[Before Christ|B.C.]]), though ''analysis'' as a formal concept is a relatively recent development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Analysis|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/analysis/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Michael Beaney|accessdate=23 May 2012|author=Michael Beaney|year=Summer 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] ἀνάλυσις (''analysis'', &quot;a breaking up&quot;, from ''ana-'' &quot;up, throughout&quot; and ''lysis'' &quot;a loosening&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=analysis (n.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=analysis|work=ONLINE ETYMOLOGY DICTIONARY|publisher=Douglas Harper|accessdate=23 May 2012|author=Douglas Harper|year=2001–2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a formal concept, the method has variously been ascribed to [[Alhazen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Al-Haytham|title=Abu Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Haytham}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[René Descartes]] (''[[Discourse on the Method]]''), and [[Galileo Galilei]]. It has also been ascribed to [[Isaac Newton]], in the form of a practical method of physical discovery (which he did not name).

{{See also|Analytical chemistry|List of chemical analysis methods}}
The field of [[chemistry]] uses analysis in at least three ways: to identify the components of a particular [[chemical compound]] (qualitative analysis), to identify the proportions of components in a [[mixture]] (quantitative analysis), and to break down [[chemical process]]es and examine [[chemical reaction]]s between [[chemical element|elements]] of [[chemical matter|matter]]. For an example of its use, analysis of the concentration of elements is important in managing a [[nuclear reactor]], so [[nuclear scientist]]s will analyze [[neutron activation analysis|neutron activation]] to develop discrete measurements within vast samples. A [[matrix (chemical analysis)|matrix]] can have a considerable effect on the way a chemical analysis is conducted and the quality of its results. Analysis can be done manually or with a [[analyzer|device]]. Chemical analysis is an important element of [[national security]] among the [[great power|major world powers]] with [[Materials MASINT|materials]] [[measurement and signature intelligence]] (MASINT) capabilities.

====Isotopes====
{{See also|Isotope analysis|Isotope geochemistry}}
Chemists can use [[isotope analysis]] to assist analysts with issues in [[anthropology]], [[archeology]], [[food chemistry]], [[forensics]], [[geology]], and a host of other questions of [[physical science]]. Analysts can discern the origins of natural and man-made isotopes in the study of [[environmental radioactivity]].

===Engineering===
{{See also|Engineering analysis|Systems analysis}}
Analysts in the field of [[engineering]] look at [[Requirement analysis|requirements]], [[structural analysis|structures]], mechanisms, [[systems analysis|systems]] and [[dimensional analysis|dimensions]]. [[Electrical engineering|Electrical engineers]] analyse [[system analysis|systems]] in [[electronics]]. [[Whole-life cost|Life cycles]] and [[Accident analysis|system failures]] are broken down and studied by engineers. It is also looking at different factors incorporated within the design.

===Intelligence===
{{See also|Intelligence analysis}}
The field of [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] employs analysts to break down and understand a wide array of questions. [[Intelligence agency|Intelligence agencies]] may use [[heuristics]], [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] and [[deductive reasoning]], [[social network analysis]], [[dynamic network analysis]], [[Social network#Social network analysis|link analysis]], and [[brainstorming]] to sort through problems they face. [[Military intelligence]] may explore issues through the use of [[game theory]], [[Red Team]]ing, and [[military simulation|wargaming]]. [[Signals intelligence]] applies [[cryptanalysis]] and [[frequency analysis]] to break [[code (cryptography)|codes]] and [[cipher]]s. [[Business intelligence]] applies theories of [[competitive intelligence|competitive intelligence analysis]] and [[competitor analysis]] to resolve questions in the [[Market (economics)|marketplace]]. [[Police|Law enforcement]] intelligence applies a number of theories in [[crime analysis]].

===Linguistics===
{{See also|Linguistics}}
Linguistics look at individual languages and [[language]] in general. It breaks language down and analyses its component parts: [[theoretical linguistics|theory]], [[phonology|sounds and their meaning]], [[pragmatics|utterance usage]], [[morphology (linguistics)|word origins]], the [[etymology|history of words]], the meaning of [[lexical semantics|words]] and [[phraseology|word combinations]], [[syntax|sentence construction]], [[discourse analysis|basic construction beyond the sentence level]], [[stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]], and [[conversation analysis|conversation]]. It examines the above using [[computational linguistics|statistics and modeling]], and [[semantic analysis (linguistics)|semantics]]. It analyses language in context of [[anthropological linguistics|anthropology]], [[biolinguistics|biology]], [[evolutionary linguistics|evolution]], [[language geography|geography]], [[historical linguistics|history]], [[neurolinguistics|neurology]], [[psycholinguistics|psychology]], and [[sociolinguistics|sociology]]. It also takes the [[applied linguistics|applied]] approach, looking at [[developmental linguistics|individual language development]] and [[clinical linguistics|clinical]] issues.

===Literature===
[[Literary criticism]] is the analysis of [[literature]]. The focus can be as diverse as the analysis of [[analysis (Homer)|Homer]] or [[psychoanalytic literary criticism|Freud]]. While not all literary-critical methods are primarily analytical in nature, the main approach to the teaching of literature in the west since the mid-twentieth century, literary formal analysis or close reading, is. This method, rooted in the academic movement labelled [[The New Criticism]], approaches texts - chiefly short poems such as [[sonnets]], which by virtue of their small size and significant complexity lend themselves well to this type of analysis - as units of discourse that can be understood in themselves, without reference to biographical or historical frameworks. This method of analysis breaks up the text linguistically in a study of [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] (the formal analysis of meter) and phonic effects such as [[alliteration]] and [[rhyme]], and cognitively in examination of the interplay of syntactic structures, figurative language, and other elements of the poem that work to produce its larger effects.

===Mathematics===
{{Main|Mathematical analysis}}

Modern mathematical analysis is the study of infinite processes. It is the branch of mathematics that includes calculus.  It can be applied in the study of [[classical mathematics|classical]] concepts of mathematics, such as [[real analysis|real numbers]], [[complex analysis|complex variables]], [[Fourier analysis|trigonometric functions]], and [[numerical analysis|algorithms]], or of [[non-classical analysis|non-classical]] concepts like [[constructivist analysis|constructivism]], [[harmonic analysis|harmonics]], [[non-standard analysis|infinity]], and [[functional analysis|vectors]].

[[Florian Cajori]] explains in [[wikiquote:A History of Mathematics|''A History of Mathematics'']] (1893) the difference between modern and ancient mathematical analysis, as distinct from logical analysis, as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The terms ''synthesis'' and ''analysis'' are used in mathematics in a more special sense than in logic. In ancient mathematics they had a different meaning from what they now have. The oldest definition of mathematical analysis as opposed to synthesis is that given in  [appended to] [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid]], XIII. 5, which in all probability was framed by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]]: &quot;Analysis is the obtaining of the thing sought by assuming it and so reasoning up to an admitted truth; synthesis is the obtaining of the thing sought by reasoning up to the inference and proof of it.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The analytic method is not conclusive, unless all operations involved in it are known to be reversible. To remove all doubt, the Greeks, as a rule, added to the analytic process a synthetic one, consisting of a reversion of all operations occurring in the analysis. Thus the aim of analysis was to aid in the discovery of synthetic proofs or solutions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

James Gow uses a similar argument as Cajori, with the following clarification, in his [https://books.google.com/books?id=KSe_ZEmHaXEC&amp; ''A Short History of Greek Mathematics''] (1884):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The synthetic proof proceeds by shewing that the proposed new truth involves certain admitted truths. An analytic proof begins by an assumption, upon which a synthetic reasoning is founded. The Greeks distinguished ''theoretic'' from ''problematic'' analysis. A theoretic analysis is of the following kind. To ''prove'' that A is B, ''assume'' first that A is B. If so, then, since B is C and C is D and D is E, therefore A is E. If this be known a falsity, A is not B. But if this be a known truth and all the intermediate propositions be [[wiktionary:convertible#Adjective|convertible]], then the reverse process, A is E, E is D, D is C, C is B, therefore A is B, constitutes a synthetic proof of the original theorem. Problematic analysis is applied in all cases where it is proposed to construct a figure which is assumed to satisfy a given condition. The problem is then converted into some theorem which is involved in the condition and which is proved synthetically, and the steps of this synthetic proof taken backwards are a synthetic solution of the problem.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
