In [[geometry]], an '''Archimedean solid''' is one of the 13 solids first enumerated by Archimedes.  They are the semi-regular [[convex polyhedron]]s composed of [[regular polygon]]s meeting in identical [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]], excluding the 5 [[Platonic solid]]s (which are composed of only one type of polygon) and excluding the prisms and antiprisms. They differ from the [[Johnson solid]]s, whose regular polygonal faces do not meet in identical vertices.

&quot;Identical vertices&quot; means that for any two vertices, there is a global [[isometry]] of the entire solid that takes one vertex to the other. {{harvs|first=Branko|last=Grünbaum|authorlink=Branko Grünbaum|year=2009|txt}} pointed out a widespread error in the literature on Archimedean solids: some authors only require that the faces that meet at one vertex be related by a local isometry to the faces that meet at any other vertex, and incorrectly claim that there are 13 solids satisfying this definition.  There are 14, because the [[elongated square gyrobicupola]] (pseudo-rhombicuboctahedron) is the unique convex polyhedron that has regular polygons meeting in the same way at each vertex, but that does not have a global symmetry taking any vertex to any other vertex.  Because of this, Grünbaum suggested that the elongated square gyrobicupola should be counted as an Archimedean solid, which would give 14 Archimedean solids, but most authors (including Archimedes himself) do not include it in their lists of 13 Archimedean solids.

[[Prism (geometry)|Prisms]] and [[antiprism]]s, whose [[symmetry group]]s are the [[dihedral group]]s, are generally not considered to be Archimedean solids, even though their faces are regular polygons and their symmetry groups act transitively on their vertices. Excluding these two infinite families, there are 13 Archimedean solids. All the Archimedean solids (but not the elongated square gyrobicupola) can be made via [[Wythoff construction]]s from the Platonic solids with [[Tetrahedral symmetry|tetrahedral]], [[Octahedral symmetry|octahedral]] and [[icosahedral symmetry]].

==Origin of name==
The Archimedean solids take their name from [[Archimedes]], who discussed them in a now-lost work. [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] refers to it, stating that Archimedes listed 13 polyhedra.&lt;ref name=&quot;g09&quot;&gt;{{harvtxt|Grünbaum|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Renaissance]], [[artist]]s and [[mathematician]]s valued ''pure forms'' with high symmetry, and by around 1620 [[Johannes Kepler]] had completed the rediscovery of the 13 polyhedra,&lt;ref&gt;Field J., Rediscovering the Archimedean Polyhedra: Piero della Francesca, Luca Pacioli, Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Dürer, Daniele Barbaro, and Johannes Kepler, ''Archive for History of Exact Sciences'', '''50''', 1997, 227&lt;/ref&gt; as well as defining the [[prism (geometry)|prisms]], [[antiprisms]], and the non-convex solids known as [[Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra]].

Kepler may have also found the elongated square gyrobicupola (pseudorhombicuboctahedron): at least, he once stated that there were 14 Archimedean solids. However, his published enumeration only includes the 13 uniform polyhedra, and the first clear statement of the pseudorhombicuboctahedron's existence was made in 1905, by [[Duncan Sommerville]].&lt;ref name=&quot;g09&quot;/&gt;

==Classification==
There are 13 Archimedean solids (not counting the [[elongated square gyrobicupola]]; 15 if the [[mirror image]]s of two [[chirality (mathematics)|enantiomorphs]], see below, are counted separately).

Here the ''vertex configuration'' refers to the type of regular polygons that meet at any given vertex. For example, a [[vertex configuration]] of (4,6,8) means that a [[square]], [[hexagon]], and [[octagon]] meet at a vertex (with the order taken to be clockwise around the vertex).

Some definitions of [[semiregular polyhedron]] include one more figure, the [[elongated square gyrobicupola]] or &quot;pseudo-rhombicuboctahedron&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Malkevitch|1988}}, p.&amp;nbsp;85&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==

The number of vertices is 720° divided by the vertex [[Defect (geometry)|angle defect]].

The cuboctahedron and icosidodecahedron are [[edge-uniform]] and are called [[quasiregular polyhedron|quasi-regular]].

The [[dual polyhedron|duals]] of the Archimedean solids are called the [[Catalan solid]]s.  Together with the [[bipyramid]]s and [[trapezohedron|trapezohedra]], these are the [[face-uniform]] solids with regular vertices.

=== Chirality ===

The snub cube and snub dodecahedron are known as ''[[chirality (mathematics)|chiral]]'', as they come in a left-handed (Latin: levomorph or laevomorph) form and right-handed (Latin: dextromorph) form.{{elucidate|reason=Which is left-handed and which is right-handed?|date=February 2017}} When something comes in multiple forms which are each other's three-dimensional [[mirror image]], these forms may be called enantiomorphs.  (This nomenclature is also used for the forms of certain [[chemical compound]]s).

== Construction of Archimedean solids ==
{{Further information|Uniform polyhedron|Conway polyhedron notation}}
[[File:Polyhedron truncation example3.png|thumb|The Archimedean solids can be constructed as [[uniform polyhedron#Convex forms by Wythoff construction|generator positions in a kaleidoscope]].]]
The different Archimedean and Platonic solids can be related to each other using a handful of general constructions.  Starting with a Platonic solid, [[truncation (geometry)|truncation]] involves cutting away of corners.  To preserve symmetry, the cut is in a plane perpendicular to the line joining a corner to the center of the polyhedron and is the same for all corners.  Depending on how much is truncated (see table below), different Platonic and Archimedean (and other) solids can be created. [[expansion (geometry)|Expansion]] or [[cantellation]] involves moving each face away from the center (by the same distance so as to preserve the symmetry of the Platonic solid) and taking the convex hull.  Expansion with twisting also involves rotating the faces, thus breaking the rectangles corresponding to edges into triangles.  The last construction we use here is truncation of both corners and edges.  Ignoring scaling, expansion can also be viewed as truncation of corners and edges but with a particular ratio between corner and edge truncation.

Note the duality between the cube and the octahedron, and between the dodecahedron and the icosahedron. Also, partially because the tetrahedron is self-dual, only one Archimedean solid has only tetrahedral symmetry.
