<text xml:space="preserve">'''''Alarums and Excursions''''' ('''''A&amp;E''''') is an [[amateur press association]] started in June 1975 by [[Lee Gold]] (at the request of [[Bruce Pelz]], who felt that discussion of ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' was taking up too much space in APA-L, the APA of Los Angeles's SF Fandom, usually collated at the [[Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arielarchives.com/Brett/magazines/alarumsandexcursions.html Bretts RPG Magazine and Zine Index] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061024220743/http://www.arielarchives.com/Brett/magazines/alarumsandexcursions.html |date=October 24, 2006 }}, entry on Alarums &amp; Excursions, retrieved September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first publication to focus solely on [[role-playing game]]s. The initial aim of the publication was to prevent the playing styles to become so divergent that people couldn't participate in games together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Each issue is a collection of contributions from different authors, often featuring game design discussions, rules variants, write-ups of game sessions, reviews, and comments on others contributions.

Although game reports and social reactions are common parts of many ''A&amp;E'' contributions, it has also, over the years, become a testing ground for new ideas on the development of the RPG as a genre and an art form. The idea that role-playing games ''are'' an art form took strong root in this zine, and left a lasting impression on many of the RPG professionals who contributed.

The June 2017 collation of ''Alarums and Excursions'' was #500, with a color cover drawn by [[Lee Moyer]] and printed by [[Rob Heinsoo]].
