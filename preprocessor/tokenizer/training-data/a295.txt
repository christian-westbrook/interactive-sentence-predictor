[[File:MerguiArchipelagoMap.png|thumb|The [[Mergui Archipelago]] in [[Burma]] (Myanmar).]]An '''archipelago''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-archipelago.ogg|ɑːr|k|ᵻ|ˈ|p|ɛ|l|ə|ɡ|oʊ}} {{respell|ark-i|PEL|ə-goh}}), sometimes called an '''island group''' or '''island chain''', is a chain, cluster or collection of [[island]]s, or sometimes a sea containing a small number of scattered islands.

The word ''archipelago'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ἄρχι- – arkhi-'' (&quot;chief&quot;) and ''πέλαγος – pélagos'' (&quot;sea&quot;) through the Italian ''arcipelago''. In [[Italian language|Italian]], possibly following a tradition of [[Classical Antiquity|antiquity]], the '''''Archipelago''''' (from [[medieval Greek]] ''[[Linguistic reconstruction|*]]ἀρχιπέλαγος'' and [[medieval Latin|Latin]] ''archipelagus'') was the proper name for the [[Aegean Sea]] and, later, usage shifted to refer to the [[Aegean Islands]] (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands).

== Types ==
Archipelagos may be found isolated in large amounts of water or neighbouring a large land mass. For example, [[Scotland]] has more than 700 islands surrounding its mainland which form an archipelago. Archipelagos are often volcanic, forming along island arcs generated by subduction zones or hotspots, but may also be the result of [[erosion]], [[Deposition (sediment)|deposition]], and [[land elevation]]. Depending on their geological origin, islands forming archipelagos can be referred to as 'oceanic islands', 'continental fragments', and 'continental islands'.&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker R. J. &amp; Fernández-Palacios J. M. (2007) ''Island Biogeography: Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation''. New York, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Oceanic islands are mainly of volcanic origin. Continental fragments correspond to land masses that have separated from a continental mass due to [[tectonic]] displacement. Finally, sets of islands formed close to the coast of a continent are considered continental archipelagos when they form part of the same continental shelf so islands are just exposed continental shelf.

[[Indonesia]], [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], the [[Philippines]], [[New Zealand]], [[Maldives]], [[the Bahamas]], [[Greece]], [[Hawaii]], [[Polynesia|the Polynesian islands]] and the [[Azores]] are examples of well-known archipelagos. The largest archipelagic state in the world by area and population is Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Indonesia | publisher=Central Intelligence Agency | work=The World Factbook | date=4 December 2008 | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/id.html | accessdate=7 December 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081210041527/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/id.html| archivedate= 10 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
