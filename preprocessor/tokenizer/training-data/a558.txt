In [[mathematics]], the '''associative property'''&lt;ref&gt;

Within an expression containing two or more occurrences in a row of the same associative operator, the order in which the [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]] are performed does not matter as long as the sequence of the [[operand]]s is not changed. That is, rearranging the [[parentheses]] in such an expression will not change its value. Consider the following equations:

:&lt;math&gt;(2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4) = 9 \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;2 \times (3 \times 4) = (2 \times 3) \times 4 = 24 .&lt;/math&gt;

Even though the parentheses were rearranged on each line, the values of the expressions were not altered. Since this holds true when performing addition and multiplication on any [[real number]]s, it can be said that &quot;addition and multiplication of real numbers are associative operations&quot;.

Associativity is not the same as [[commutativity]], which addresses whether or not the order of two [[operand]]s changes the result. For example, the order doesn't matter in the multiplication of real numbers, that is, {{nowrap|1=''a'' × ''b'' = ''b'' × ''a''}}, so we say that the multiplication of real numbers is a commutative operation.

Associative operations are abundant in mathematics; in fact, many [[algebraic structure]]s (such as [[semigroup (mathematics)|semigroups]] and [[category (mathematics)|categories]]) explicitly require their binary operations to be associative.

However, many important and interesting operations are non-associative; some examples include [[subtraction]], [[exponentiation]], and the [[vector cross product]].  In contrast to the theoretical properties of real numbers, the addition of [[floating point]] numbers in computer science is not associative, and the choice of how to associate an expression can have a significant effect on rounding error.

== Definition ==
[[File:Semigroup_associative.svg|thumbnail|A binary operation ∗ on the set ''S'' is associative when [[Commutative diagram|this diagram commutes]]. That is, when the two paths from ''S''×''S''×''S'' to ''S'' [[Function composition|compose]] to the same function from ''S''×''S''×''S'' to ''S''.]]
Formally, a [[binary operation]] ∗ on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' is called '''associative''' if it satisfies the '''associative law''':

:(''x'' ∗ ''y'') ∗ ''z'' = ''x'' ∗ (''y'' ∗ ''z'') for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in ''S''.

Here, ∗ is used to replace the symbol of the operation, which may be any symbol, and even the absence of symbol ([[wikt:juxtaposition|juxtaposition]]) as for [[multiplication]].

:(''xy'')''z'' = ''x''(''yz'') = ''xyz'' for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in ''S''.

The associative law can also be expressed in functional notation thus: {{nowrap|1=''f''(''f''(''x'', ''y''), ''z'') = ''f''(''x'', ''f''(''y'', ''z''))}}.

==Generalized associative law==
[[Image:Tamari lattice.svg|thumb|250px|In the absence of the associative property, five factors ''a, b, c, d, e'' result in a [[Tamari lattice]] of order four, possibly different products.]]
If a binary operation is associative, repeated application of the operation produces the same result regardless how valid pairs of parenthesis are inserted in the expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Durbin |first=John R. |title=Modern Algebra: an Introduction |year=1992 |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |isbn=0-471-51001-7 |page=78 |url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP000258.html |edition=3rd |quote=If &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \,\, (n \ge 2)&lt;/math&gt; are elements of a set with an associative operation, then the product &lt;math&gt;a_1 a_2 \dots a_n&lt;/math&gt; is unambiguous; this is, the same element will be obtained regardless of how parentheses are inserted in the product}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is called the '''generalized associative law'''. For instance, a product of four elements may be written in five possible ways:

# ((ab)c)d
# (ab)(cd)
# (a(bc))d
# a((bc)d)
# a(b(cd))

If the product operation is associative, the generalized associative law says that all these formulas will yield the same result, making the parenthesis unnecessary. Thus &quot;the&quot; product can be written unambiguously as

:abcd.

As the number of elements increases, the [[Catalan number#Applications in combinatorics|number of possible ways to insert parentheses]] grows quickly, but they remain unnecessary for disambiguation.

==Examples==
[[File:Associativity of binary operations (without question marks).svg|thumb|In associative operations is &lt;math&gt;(x\circ y)\circ z = x\circ(y\circ z)&lt;/math&gt;.]]
[[File:Associativity of real number addition.svg|thumb|The addition of real numbers is associative.]]
Some examples of associative operations include the following.
* The [[string concatenation|concatenation]] of the three strings &lt;code&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&quot;world&quot;&lt;/code&gt; can be computed by concatenating the first two strings (giving &lt;code&gt;&quot;hello &quot;&lt;/code&gt;) and appending the third string (&lt;code&gt;&quot;world&quot;&lt;/code&gt;), or by joining the second and third string (giving &lt;code&gt;&quot; world&quot;&lt;/code&gt;) and concatenating the first string (&lt;code&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/code&gt;) with the result. The two methods produce the same result; string concatenation is associative (but not commutative).
* In [[arithmetic]], [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] of [[real number]]s are associative; i.e.,
:: &lt;math&gt;
\left.
\begin{matrix}
(x+y)+z=x+(y+z)=x+y+z\quad
\\
(x\,y)z=x(y\,z)=x\,y\,z\qquad\qquad\qquad\quad\ \ \,
\end{matrix}
\right\}
\mbox{for all }x,y,z\in\mathbb{R}.
&lt;/math&gt;
:Because of associativity, the grouping parentheses can be omitted without ambiguity.
* Addition and multiplication of [[complex number]]s and [[quaternion]]s are associative. Addition of [[octonion]]s is also associative, but multiplication of octonions is non-associative.
* The [[greatest common divisor]] and [[least common multiple]] functions act associatively.
:: &lt;math&gt;

\left.
\begin{matrix}
\operatorname{gcd}(\operatorname{gcd}(x,y),z)=
\operatorname{gcd}(x,\operatorname{gcd}(y,z))=
\operatorname{gcd}(x,y,z)\ \quad
\\
\operatorname{lcm}(\operatorname{lcm}(x,y),z)=
\operatorname{lcm}(x,\operatorname{lcm}(y,z))=
\operatorname{lcm}(x,y,z)\quad
\end{matrix}
\right\}\mbox{ for all }x,y,z\in\mathbb{Z}.
&lt;/math&gt;
* Taking the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] or the [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]:
:: &lt;math&gt;

\left.
\begin{matrix}
(A\cap B)\cap C=A\cap(B\cap C)=A\cap B\cap C\quad
\\
(A\cup B)\cup C=A\cup(B\cup C)=A\cup B\cup C\quad
\end{matrix}
\right\}\mbox{for all sets }A,B,C.
&lt;/math&gt;
* If ''M'' is some set and ''S'' denotes the set of all functions from ''M'' to ''M'', then the operation of [[functional composition]] on ''S'' is associative:

:: &lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)\circ h=f\circ(g\circ h)=f\circ g\circ h\qquad\mbox{for all }f,g,h\in S.&lt;/math&gt;
* Slightly more generally, given four sets ''M'', ''N'', ''P'' and ''Q'', with ''h'': ''M'' to ''N'', ''g'': ''N'' to ''P'', and ''f'': ''P'' to ''Q'', then

:: &lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)\circ h=f\circ(g\circ h)=f\circ g\circ h&lt;/math&gt;

: as before. In short, composition of maps is always associative.
* Consider a set with three elements, A, B, and C. The following operation:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
! × !! A !! B !! C
|-
! A
| A || A || A
|-
! B
| A || B || C
|-
! C
| A || A || A
|-
|}

:is associative. Thus, for example, A(BC)=(AB)C = A. This operation is not commutative.
* Because [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] represent [[Linear map|linear transformation]] functions, with [[matrix multiplication]] representing functional composition, one can immediately conclude that matrix multiplication is associative. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/matrix-transformations/composition-of-transformations/v/matrix-product-associativity|title=Matrix product associativity|publisher=Khan Academy|accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Propositional logic ==

=== Rule of replacement ===
In standard truth-functional propositional logic, ''association'',&lt;ref&gt;Moore and Parker{{full citation needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Copi and Cohen{{full citation needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''associativity''&lt;ref&gt;Hurley{{full citation needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; are two [[validity|valid]] [[rule of replacement|rules of replacement]]. The rules allow one to move parentheses in [[well-formed formula|logical expressions]] in [[formal proof|logical proofs]]. The rules are:
:&lt;math&gt;(P \or (Q \or R)) \Leftrightarrow ((P \or Q) \or R)&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;(P \and (Q \and R)) \Leftrightarrow ((P \and Q) \and R),&lt;/math&gt;
where &quot;&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;&quot; is a [[metalogic]]al [[Symbol (formal)|symbol]] representing &quot;can be replaced in a [[Formal proof|proof]] with.&quot;

=== Truth functional connectives ===
''Associativity'' is a property of some [[logical connective]]s of truth-functional [[propositional logic]]. The following [[logical equivalence]]s demonstrate that associativity is a property of particular connectives. The following are truth-functional [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]].

'''Associativity of disjunction''':
:&lt;math&gt;((P \or Q) \or R) \leftrightarrow (P \or (Q \or R))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(P \or (Q \or R)) \leftrightarrow ((P \or Q) \or R)&lt;/math&gt;
'''Associativity of conjunction''':
:&lt;math&gt;((P \and Q) \and R) \leftrightarrow (P \and (Q \and R))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(P \and (Q \and R)) \leftrightarrow ((P \and Q) \and R)&lt;/math&gt;
'''Associativity of equivalence''':
:&lt;math&gt;((P \leftrightarrow Q) \leftrightarrow R) \leftrightarrow (P \leftrightarrow (Q \leftrightarrow R))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(P \leftrightarrow (Q \leftrightarrow R)) \leftrightarrow ((P \leftrightarrow Q) \leftrightarrow R)&lt;/math&gt;

== Non-associative operation==
A binary operation &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; on a set ''S'' that does not satisfy the associative law is called '''non-associative'''. Symbolically,

:&lt;math&gt;(x*y)*z\ne x*(y*z)\qquad\mbox{for some }x,y,z\in S.&lt;/math&gt;

For such an operation the order of evaluation ''does'' matter. For example:
* [[Subtraction]]
:&lt;math&gt;
(5-3)-2 \, \ne \, 5-(3-2)
&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Division (mathematics)|Division]]
:&lt;math&gt;
(4/2)/2 \, \ne \, 4/(2/2)
&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Exponentiation]]
:&lt;math&gt;
2^{(1^2)} \, \ne \, (2^1)^2
&lt;/math&gt;
Also note that infinite sums are not generally associative, for example:
:&lt;math&gt;
(1+-1)+(1+-1)+(1+-1)+(1+-1)+(1+-1)+(1+-1)+\dots \, = \, 0
&lt;/math&gt;
whereas
:&lt;math&gt;
1+(-1+1)+(-1+1)+(-1+1)+(-1+1)+(-1+1)+(-1+1)+\dots \, = \, 1
&lt;/math&gt;

The study of non-associative structures arises from reasons somewhat different from the mainstream of classical algebra. One area within [[non-associative algebra]] that has grown very large is that of [[Lie algebra]]s. There the associative law is replaced by the [[Jacobi identity]]. Lie algebras abstract the essential nature of [[infinitesimal transformation]]s, and have become ubiquitous in mathematics.

There are other specific types of non-associative structures that have been studied in depth; these tend to come from some specific applications or areas such as [[combinatorial mathematics]]. Other examples are [[Quasigroup]], [[Quasifield]], [[Non-associative ring]], [[Non-associative algebra]] and [[Commutative non-associative magmas]].

===Nonassociativity of floating point calculation===

In mathematics, addition and multiplication of real numbers is associative.  By contrast, in computer science, the addition and multiplication of [[floating point]] numbers is ''not'' associative, as rounding errors are introduced when dissimilar-sized values are joined together.&lt;ref&gt;Knuth, Donald, [[The Art of Computer Programming]], Volume 3, section 4.2.2&lt;/ref&gt;

To illustrate this, consider a floating point representation with a 4-bit mantissa:
&lt;br /&gt;(1.000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; +
1.000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) +
1.000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; =
1.000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; +
1.000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; =
1.00{{fontcolor|red|1}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;1.000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; +
(1.000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; +
1.000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) =
1.000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; +
1.00{{fontcolor|red|0}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; =
1.00{{fontcolor|red|0}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

Even though most computers compute with a 24 or 53 bits of mantissa,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic |author=IEEE Computer Society |date=August 29, 2008 |publisher=IEEE |id=IEEE Std 754-2008 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4610933 |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2008.4610935 |ref=CITEREFIEEE_7542008 |isbn=978-0-7381-5753-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is an important source of rounding error, and approaches such as the [[Kahan summation algorithm]] are ways to minimise the errors. It can be especially problematic in parallel computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

=== Notation for non-associative operations ===
{{main|Operator associativity}}

In general, parentheses must be used to indicate the [[order of operations|order of evaluation]] if a non-associative operation appears more than once in an expression. However, [[mathematician]]s agree on a particular order of evaluation for several common non-associative operations. This is simply a notational convention to avoid parentheses.

A '''left-associative''' operation is a non-associative operation that is conventionally evaluated from left to right, i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;
\left.
\begin{matrix}
x*y*z=(x*y)*z\qquad\qquad\quad\,
\\
w*x*y*z=((w*x)*y)*z\quad
\\
\mbox{etc.}\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\ \ \,
\end{matrix}
\right\}
\mbox{for all }w,x,y,z\in S
&lt;/math&gt;
while a '''right-associative''' operation is conventionally evaluated from right to left:
:&lt;math&gt;
\left.
\begin{matrix}
x*y*z=x*(y*z)\qquad\qquad\quad\,
\\
w*x*y*z=w*(x*(y*z))\quad
\\
\mbox{etc.}\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\ \ \,
\end{matrix}
\right\}
\mbox{for all }w,x,y,z\in S
&lt;/math&gt;
Both left-associative and right-associative operations occur. Left-associative operations include the following:
* Subtraction and division of real numbers:
::&lt;math&gt;x-y-z=(x-y)-z\qquad\mbox{for all }x,y,z\in\mathbb{R};&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;x/y/z=(x/y)/z\qquad\qquad\quad\mbox{for all }x,y,z\in\mathbb{R}\mbox{ with }y\ne0,z\ne0.&lt;/math&gt;
* Function application:
::&lt;math&gt;(f \, x \, y) = ((f \, x) \, y)&lt;/math&gt;
:This notation can be motivated by the [[currying]] isomorphism.

Right-associative operations include the following:
* [[Exponentiation]] of real numbers:
::&lt;math&gt;x^{y^z}=x^{(y^z)}&lt;/math&gt;

:One reason exponentiation is right-associative is that a repeated left-associative exponentiation operation would be less useful. Multiple appearances could (and would) be rewritten with multiplication:

::&lt;math&gt;(x^y)^z=x^{(yz)}&lt;/math&gt;

:An additional argument for exponentiation being right-associative is that the superscript inherently behaves as a set of parentheses; e.g. in the expression &lt;math&gt;2^{x+3}&lt;/math&gt; the addition is performed [[order of operations|before]] the exponentiation despite there being no explicit parentheses &lt;math&gt;2^{(x+3)}&lt;/math&gt; wrapped around it. Thus given an expression such as &lt;math&gt;x^{y^z}&lt;/math&gt;, it makes sense to require evaluating the full exponent &lt;math&gt;y^z&lt;/math&gt; of the base &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; first.
* [[Tetration]] via the [[Up arrow notation|up-arrow]] operator:

::&lt;math&gt; a \uparrow \uparrow b = \, ^{b}a&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Function (mathematics)|Function definition]]
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} \rarr \mathbb{Z} \rarr \mathbb{Z} = \mathbb{Z} \rarr (\mathbb{Z} \rarr \mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;x \mapsto y \mapsto x - y = x \mapsto (y \mapsto x - y)&lt;/math&gt;

:Using right-associative notation for these operations can be motivated by the [[Curry-Howard correspondence]] and by the [[currying]] isomorphism.

Non-associative operations for which no conventional evaluation order is defined include the following.
* Taking the [[Cross product]] of three vectors:
::&lt;math&gt;\vec a \times (\vec b \times \vec c) \neq (\vec a \times \vec b ) \times \vec c \qquad \mbox{ for some } \vec a,\vec b,\vec c \in \mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;
* Taking the pairwise [[average]] of real numbers:
::&lt;math&gt;{(x+y)/2+z\over2}\ne{x+(y+z)/2\over2} \qquad \mbox{for all }x,y,z\in\mathbb{R} \mbox{ with }x\ne z.&lt;/math&gt;
* Taking the [[complement (set theory)|relative complement]] of sets &lt;math&gt;(A\backslash B)\backslash C&lt;/math&gt; is not the same as &lt;math&gt;A\backslash (B\backslash C)&lt;/math&gt;. (Compare [[material nonimplication]] in logic.)
