'''Athena''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|θ|iː|n|ə}}; [[Attic Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀθηνᾶ}}, ''Athēnā'', or {{lang|grc|Ἀθηναία}}, ''Athēnaia''; [[Epic Greek|Epic]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀθηναίη}}, ''Athēnaiē''; [[Doric Greek|Doric]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀθάνα}}, ''Athānā'') or '''Athene''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|θ|iː|n|iː}}; [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀθήνη}}, ''Athēnē''), often given the [[epithet]] '''Pallas''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|æ|l|ə|s}}; {{lang|grc|Παλλὰς}}), is the goddess of wisdom, craft, and war&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=eKNK1YwHcQ4C&amp;pg=PA81 s.v. &quot;Athena p. 81].&lt;/ref&gt; in [[ancient Greek religion]] and [[Greek mythology|mythology]]. In later times, Athena was [[Interpretatio graeca|syncretized]] with the [[Roman goddess]] [[Minerva]].{{sfn|Deacy|Villing|2001|pages=}}

In [[ancient Greek literature]], Athena is portrayed as the astute companion of [[hero]]es and as the patron [[goddess]] of heroic endeavour. Athena probably takes her name from the city of [[Athens]],{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=139}} of which she was the patron.{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=139}} The Athenians constructed the [[Parthenon]] atop their [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] as a temple to Athena; it takes its name from her epithet ''Parthenos'', which means &quot;[[Virginity|Virgin]]&quot;.{{sfn|Deacy|Villing|2001|pages=}} Throughout the Greek world, Athena was venerated as the protectress of the city (''[[polis]]'');{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=140}} she was known as ''Polias'' and ''Poliouchos''{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=140}} and her temples were usually located atop the fortified [[Acropolis]] in the central part of the city.{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=140}}

==Etymology==
Athena is associated with the city of [[Athens]].{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=139}} The name of the city in ancient Greek is ''Ἀθῆναι'' (''Athenai''), a plural [[toponym]], designating the place where—according to myth—she presided over her sisterhood, the ''Athenai''.{{snf|Ruck|Staples|1994|page=24}} In ancient times, scholars argued whether Athena was named after Athens or Athens after Athena.{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=139}} Now scholars generally agree that the goddess takes her name from the city;{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=139}} the ending -''ene'' is common in names of locations, but rare for personal names.{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=139}} Testimonies from different cities in [[ancient Greece]] attest that similar [[city goddess]]es were worshipped in other cities{{snf|Ruck|Staples|1994|page=24}} and, like Athena, took their names from the cities where they were worshipped.{{snf|Ruck|Staples|1994|page=24}} For example, in [[Mycenae]] there was a goddess called Mykene, whose sisterhood was known as ''Mykenai'',{{snf|Ruck|Staples|1994|page=24}} whereas at [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] an analogous deity was called Thebe, and the city was known under the plural form ''Thebai'' (or Thebes, in English, where the ‘s’ is the plural formation).{{snf|Ruck|Staples|1994|page=24}} The name ''Athenai'' is likely of [[Pre-Greek]] origin{{snf|Beekes|2009|page=29}} because it contains the presumably Pre-Greek morpheme ''*-ān-''.{{snf|Beekes|2009|page=29}}

In his dialogue ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', the Greek philosopher [[Plato]] (428–347 BC) gives some rather imaginative etymologies of Athena's name, based on the theories of the ancient Athenians and his own etymological speculations:

{{quote|That is a graver matter, and there, my friend, the modern interpreters of Homer may, I think, assist in explaining the view of the ancients. For most of these in their explanations of the poet, assert that he meant by Athena &quot;mind&quot; [{{lang|grc|νοῦς}}, ''[[Nous|noũs]]''] and &quot;intelligence&quot; [{{lang|grc|διάνοια}}, ''[[diánoia]]''], and the maker of names appears to have had a singular notion about her; and indeed calls her by a still higher title, &quot;divine intelligence&quot; [{{lang|grc|θεοῦ νόησις}}, ''theoũ nóēsis''], as though he would say: This is she who has the mind of God [{{lang|grc|ἁ θεονόα}}, ''a theonóa''). Perhaps, however, the name Theonoe may mean &quot;she who knows divine things&quot; [{{lang|grc|τὰ θεῖα νοοῦσα}}, ''ta theia noousa''] better than others. Nor shall we be far wrong in supposing that the author of it wished to identify this Goddess with moral intelligence [{{lang|grc|εν έθει νόεσιν}}, ''en éthei nóesin''], and therefore gave her the name Etheonoe; which, however, either he or his successors have altered into what they thought a nicer form, and called her Athena''.|author=Plato|title=Cratylus ''407b''}}

Thus, Plato believed that Athena's name was derived from Greek {{lang|grc|Ἀθεονόα}}, ''Atheonóa''—which the later Greeks rationalised as from the deity's (θεός, ''theós'') mind (νοῦς, ''noũs''). Other Greek authors{{who|date=April 2010}} attempted to derive natural symbols from the etymological roots of Athena's names to be ''aether'', ''air'', ''earth'', and ''moon''.{{snf|Johrens|1981|pages=438-452}}

==Origins==
Athena was originally the [[Aegean civilization|Aegean]] goddess of the palace, who presided over household crafts and protected the king.{{sfn|Nilsson|1967|pages=347, 433}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=140}}{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=133}}{{sfn|Kinsely|1989|pages=141-142}} A single [[Mycenaean Greek]] inscription {{lang|gmy|𐀀𐀲𐀙𐀡𐀴𐀛𐀊}} ''a-ta-na po-ti-ni-ja'' /Athana potnia/ appears at [[Knossos]] in the [[Linear B]] tablets from the Late Minoan II-era &quot;Room of the Chariot Tablets&quot;; these comprise the earliest Linear B archive anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;[[Knossos|KN]] V 52, text 208 in Ventris and Chadwick, ''Documents in Mycenaean Greek'', [https://books.google.de/books?id=AkgPCAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Ventris%2C%20Michael%20and%20John%20Chadwick%2C%201973.%20Documents%20in%20Mycenaean%20Greek&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 126 f.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&amp;wid=797 |title=Palaeolexicon, Word study tool of ancient languages |publisher=Palaeolexicon.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''Athana potnia'' often is translated ''Mistress Athena'',{{sfn|Palaima|2004|page=444}} it could also mean &quot;the ''[[Potnia]]'' of Athana&quot;, and thus perhaps ''the Lady of Athens''.{{sfn|Palaima|2004|page=444}} However, any connection to the city of Athens in the Knossos inscription is uncertain.{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=44}} In the still undeciphered corpus of [[Linear A]] tablets—written in the unclassified [[Minoan language]]—a sign series ''a-ta-no-dju-wa-ja'' is to be found.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kophinas|KO]] Za 1 inscription, line 1.&lt;/ref&gt; This could be connected with the Linear B Mycenaean expressions ''a-ta-na po-ti-ni-ja'' and ''di-u-ja'' or ''di-wi-ja'' (''Diwia'', &quot;of Zeus&quot; or, possibly, related to a [[List_of_Mycenaean_deities#Goddesses|homonymous goddess]]),&lt;ref&gt;''Cfr.'' Ventris and Chadwick, ''Documents in Mycenaean Greek'', p. 126 f.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a translation &quot;Athena of Zeus&quot; or &quot;divine Athena&quot;. Similarly, in the Greek mythology and epic tradition, Athena figures as a daughter of Zeus (Διός θυγάτηρ; ''cfr.'' [[Dyeus]]).{{sfn|Best|1989|page=30}} However, the inscription quoted seems to be very similar to &quot;a-ta-nū-tī wa-ya&quot;, quoted as [[Kato Syme|SY]] Za 1 by Jan Best.{{sfn|Best|1989|page=30}} Best translates the initial ''a-ta-nū-tī'', which is recurrent in line beginnings, as &quot;I have given&quot;.{{sfn|Best|1989|page=30}}

In a [[Mycenea]]n fresco, there is a composition of two women extending their hands towards a central figure, who is covered by an enormous figure-eight shield;{{sfn|Mylonas|1966|page=159}} this may depict the warrior-goddess with her [[Palladium (classical antiquity)|palladium]], or her palladium in an aniconic representation.{{sfn|Mylonas|1966|page=159}} In the &quot;[[List of Aegean frescos|Procession Fresco]]&quot; at [[Knossos]], which was reconstructed by the Mycenaeans,{{sfn|Fururmark|1978|page=672}} two rows of figures carrying vessels seem to meet in front of a central figure,{{sfn|Fururmark|1978|page=672}} which is probably the Minoan precursor to Athena.{{sfn|Fururmark|1978|page=672}} The early twentieth-century scholar [[Martin P. Nilsson|Martin Persson Nilsson]] argued that the [[Minoan snake goddess figurines]] are early representations of Athena.{{sfn|Nilsson|1967|pages=347, 433}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=140}}

[[File:Athena Parthenos Altemps Inv8622.jpg|thumb|Marble Greek copy signed &quot;Antiokhos&quot;, a 1st-century BC variant of [[Phidias]]' 5th century ''[[Athena Promachos]]'' that stood on the [[Acropolis]]]]

Nilsson and others have claimed that, in early times, Athena was either an [[owl]] herself or a [[bird goddess]] in general.{{snf|Nilsson|1950|page=496}} In the third book of the ''[[Odyssey]]'', she takes the form of a [[Sea eagle (bird)|sea-eagle]].{{snf|Nilsson|1950|page=496}} Proponents of this view argue that she dropped her prophylactic owl-mask before she lost her wings. &quot;Athena, by the time she appears in art,&quot; Jane Ellen Harrison remarks, &quot;has completely shed her animal form, has reduced the shapes she once wore of snake and bird to attributes, but occasionally in [[Black figure pottery|black-figure vase-paintings]] she still appears with wings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison 1922:306. {{cite web|url=http://people.uncw.edu/kozloffm/Winged_Athena.jpg |title=''Cfr. ibid.'', p. 307, fig. 84: Detail of a cup in the Faina collection |accessdate=2007-05-06 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041105112709/http://people.uncw.edu/kozloffm/Winged_Athena.jpg |archivedate=5 November 2004 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally agreed that the cult of Athena preserves some aspects of the Proto-Indo-European [[Proto-Indo-European religion#Societal deities|transfunctional goddess]].{{snf|Puhvel|1987|pages=133-134}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=433}} The cult of Athena may have also been influenced by those of Near Eastern warrior goddesses such as the [[East Semitic]] [[Ishtar]] and the [[Ugarit]]ic [[Anat]],{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=140}} both of whom were often portrayed bearing arms.{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=140}}

Miriam Robbins Dexter has suggested that, at least at some point in her history, Athena was a [[solar deity]].{{snf|Dexter|1984|pages=137-144}} Athena bears traits common with [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] solar goddesses,{{snf|Dexter|1984|pages=137-144}} including the possession of a mirror and the invention of weaving, characteristics which are also held by the Baltic goddess [[Saulė]].{{snf|Dexter|1984|pages=137-144}} Athena's association with Medusa, who is also suspected of being a solar goddess,{{snf|Dexter|1984|pages=137-144}} adds further solar iconography to her cultus.{{snf|Dexter|1984|pages=137-144}} Athena was later syncretized with [[Sulis]], a Celtic goddess whose name is derived from the common Proto-Indo-European root for many solar deities.{{snf|Dexter|1984|pages=137-144}} Though the sun in Greek myth is personified as the male [[Helios]], several relictual solar goddesses are known, such as [[Alectrona]].{{snf|Dexter|1984|pages=137-144}}

Plato notes that the citizens of [[Sais]] in Egypt worshipped a goddess known as [[Neith]],&lt;ref group=&quot;Notes&quot;&gt;&quot;The citizens have a deity for their foundress; she is called in the Egyptian tongue Neith, and is asserted by them to be the same whom the Hellenes call Athena; they are great lovers of the Athenians, and say that they are in some way related to them.&quot; (''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0180%3Atext%3DTim.%3Asection%3D21e#note-link2 21e].)&lt;/ref&gt; whom he identifies with Athena.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. also Herodotus, ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 2:170–175.&lt;/ref&gt; Neith was the ancient Egyptian goddess of war and hunting, who was also associated with weaving; her worship began during the Egyptian Pre-Dynastic period. In Greek mythology, Athena was reported to have visited mythological sites in North Africa, including Libya's [[Triton (mythology)|Triton River]] and the [[Phlegra (mythology)|Phlegraean plain]].&lt;ref group=&quot;Notes&quot;&gt;[[Aeschylus]], ''[[The Eumenides|Eumenides]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0006:card=276&amp;highlight=triton#note-link295 v. 292 f.]. Cf. the tradition that she was the daughter of Neilos: see, e.&amp;nbsp;g. Clement of Alexandria ''Protr.'' 2.28.2; Cicero, ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' 3.59.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these similarities, the [[sinologist]] [[Martin Bernal]] created the &quot;[[Black Athena]]&quot; hypothesis, which claimed that Neith was brought to Greece from Egypt, along with &quot;an enormous number of features of civilization and culture in the third and second millennia&quot;.{{snf|Bernal|1987|pages=21, 51 ff}} The &quot;Black Athena&quot; hypothesis stirred up widespread controversy near the end of the twentieth century,{{snf|Berlinerblau|1999|page=93ff}} but it has now been widely rejected by modern scholars.{{snf|Jasanoff|Nussbaum|1996|page=194}}

==Cult and patronages==
[[File:Tétradrachme athénien représentant Athéna.jpg|thumb|right|Athenian [[tetradrachm]] representing the goddess Athena]]
[[File:Peplos scene BM EV.JPG|thumb|A new ''[[peplos]]'' was woven for Athena and ceremonially brought to dress her [[cult image]] ([[British Museum]]).]]
In her aspect of ''Athena Polias'', Athena was venerated as the goddess of the city and the protectress of the citadel.{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=140}}{{snf|Herrington|1955|pages=11-15}} In Athens, the [[Plynteria]], or &quot;Feast of the Bath&quot;, was observed every year at the end of the month of [[Thargelion]].{{sfn|Simon|1983|page=46}} The festival lasted for five days. During this period, the priestesses of Athena, or ''plyntrídes'', performed a cleansing ritual within the [[Erechtheion]], a sanctuary devoted to Athena and Poseidon.{{sfn|Simon|1983|pages=46-49}} Here Athena's statue was undressed, her clothes washed, and body purified.{{sfn|Simon|1983|pages=46-49}}

Athena was worshipped at festivals such as [[Chalceia]] as ''Athena Ergane'',{{snf|Herrington|1955|pages=1-11}} the patroness of various crafts, especially [[weaving]].{{sfn|Herrington|1955|pages=1-11}} She was also the patron of metalworkers and was believed to aid in the forging of armor and weapons.{{sfn|Herrington|1955|pages=1-11}} During the late 5th century BC, the role of goddess of philosophy became a major aspect of Athena's [[cult (religious practice)|cult]].{{sfn|Burkert|1985|pages=305-337}}

As ''[[Athena Promachos]]'', she was believed to lead soldiers into battle.{{sfn|Herrington|1955|pages=11-14}}{{sfn|Schmitt|2000|pages=1059-1073}} Athena represented the disciplined, strategic side of war, in contrast to her brother [[Ares]], the patron of violence, bloodlust, and slaughter—&quot;the raw force of war&quot;.{{sfn|Darmon|1992|pages=114-115}} Athena was believed to only support those fighting for a just cause{{sfn|Darmon|1992|pages=114-115}} and was thought to view war primarily as a means to resolve conflict.{{sfn|Darmon|1992|pages=114-115}} In this aspect, Athena was also known as ''[[Athena Parthenos|Parthenos]]'',{{sfn|Harrington|1955|pages=11-14}} which means &quot;virgin&quot;,{{sfn|Goldhill|1986|page=121}}{{sfn|Garland|2008|page=217}} because she was believed to have never married or taken a lover.{{sfn|Goldhill|1986|page=31}} Athena was especially worshipped in this role during the festivals of the [[Panathenaea]] and [[Pamboeotia]],{{sfn|Noel|1992|pages=90-109}} both of which prominently featured displays of athletic and military prowess.{{sfn|Noel|1992|pages=90-109}} As the patroness of heroes and warriors,{{sfn|Hurwit|1999|page=18}} Athena was believed to favor those who used cunning and intelligence rather than brute strength.{{sfn|Hurwit|1999|page=18}}

[[File:AttalusICorrected.jpg|thumb|left|Athena depicted on a coin of [[Attalus I]], ruler of [[Pergamon]], c.{{nbsp}}200 BC]]

Athena was not only the patron goddess of Athens, but also other cities, including [[Argos]], [[Sparta]], [[Gortyn]], [[Lindos]], and [[Larisa]].{{snf|Schmitt|2000|pages=1059-1073}} The various cults of Athena were all branches of her panhellenic cult{{sfn|Schmitt|2000|pages=1059-1073}} and often proctored various initiation rites of Grecian youth, such as the passage into citizenship by young men or the passage of young women into marriage.{{sfn|Schmitt|2000|pages=1059-1073}} These cults were portals of a uniform socialization, even beyond mainland Greece.{{sfn|Schmitt|2000|pages=1059-1073}}

Athena was frequently equated with [[Aphaea]], a local goddess of the island of [[Aegina]], originally from [[Crete]] and also associated with [[Artemis]] and the nymph [[Britomartis]].{{sfn|Pilafidis-Williams|1998|pages=}} In [[Arcadia]], she was assimilated with the ancient goddess Alea and worshiped as [[Athena Alea]].{{sfn|Jost|1996|pages=134-135}} Sanctuaries dedicated to Athena Alea were located in the [[Laconia]]n towns of [[Mantineia]] and [[Tegea]]. The temple of Athena Alea in Tegea was an important religious center of ancient Greece.&lt;ref group=&quot;Notes&quot;&gt;&quot;This sanctuary had been respected from early days by all the [[Peloponnesian]]s, and afforded peculiar safety to its suppliants&quot; (Pausanias, ''Description of Greece''  iii.5.6)&lt;/ref&gt; The geographer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] was informed that the ''temenos'' had been founded by [[Aleus]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' viii.4.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Votive bronzes at the site from the Geometric and Archaic periods take the forms of horses and deer; there are sealstone and [[fibula]]e. In the Archaic period, the nine villages that underlie Tegea banded together in a [[synoecism]] to form one city.&lt;ref group=&quot;Notes&quot;&gt;Compare the origin of [[Sparta]].&lt;/ref&gt; Tegea was listed in [[Homer]]'s [[Catalogue of Ships]] as one of the cities that contributed ships and men for the [[War of Troy|Achaean assault on Troy]].

In Sparta, the temple of Athena ''Khalkíoikos'' (Athena &quot;of the Brazen House&quot;, often [[latin]]ized as ''Chalcioecus'') was the grandest and located on the Spartan acropolis; presumably it had a roof of bronze. The forecourt of the Brazen House was the place where the most solemn religious functions in Sparta took place.

Athena was known as '''Atrytone''' ({{lang|grc|Άτρυτώνη}} &quot;the Unwearying&quot;), '''Parthenos''' ({{lang|grc|Παρθένος}} &quot;Virgin&quot;), and '''Promachos''' ({{lang|grc|Πρόμαχος}} &quot;she who fights in front&quot;). The epithet '''Polias''' (Πολιάς &quot;of the city&quot;), refers to Athena's role as protectress of the city.{{snf|Schmitt|2000|pages=1059-1073}} The epithet '''Ergane''' (Εργάνη &quot;the Industrious&quot;) pointed her out as the patron of craftsmen and artisans.{{sfn|Schmitt|2000|pages=1059-1073}} After serving as the judge at the trial of [[Orestes]] in which he was acquitted of having murdered his mother [[Clytemnestra]], Athena won the epithet '''Areia''' (Αρεία).{{sfn|Schmitt|2000|pages=1059-1073}}

In [[Homer]]'s [[Epic poetry|epic works]], Athena's most common [[epithets in Homer|epithet]] is '''Glaukopis''' ({{lang|grc|γλαυκῶπις}}), which usually is translated as, &quot;bright-eyed&quot; or &quot;with gleaming eyes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|glaukw{{=}}pis|γλαυκῶπις|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The word is a combination of ''glaukós'' ({{lang|grc|γλαυκός}}, meaning &quot;gleaming, silvery&quot;, and later, &quot;bluish-green&quot; or &quot;gray&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|glauko/s1|γλαυκός|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''ṓps'' ({{lang|grc|ὤψ}}, &quot;eye, face&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|w)/y|ὤψ|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''glaúx'' ({{lang|grc|γλαύξ}},&lt;ref&gt;[[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson|Thompson, D'Arcy Wentworth]].

Athena was clearly associated with the owl from very early on;{{sfn|Nilsson|1950|pages=491–496}} in archaic images, she is frequently depicted with an [[Owl of Athena|owl]] perched on her hand.{{sfn|Nilsson|1950|pages=491–496}} Through its association with Athena, the owl evolved into the national mascot of the Athenians and eventually became a symbol of wisdom.{{sfn|Deacy|Villing|2001|pages=}}

Other epithets include [[Ageleia]], [[Itonia]] and '''Aethyia''' under which she was worshiped in [[Megara]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], i. 5. § 3; 41. § 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''aíthyia'' ({{lang|grc|αἴθυια}}) signifies a &quot;diver&quot;, also some diving bird species (possibly the [[shearwater]]) and figuratively, a &quot;ship&quot;, so the name must reference Athena teaching the art of shipbuilding or navigation.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Tzetzes]], ''ad Lycophr.'', ''l.c.''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |last=Schmitz |first=Leonhard |title=Aethyia |editor-last=Smith |editor-first = William |encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] |volume=1 |page=51 |place=Boston, MA |year=1867 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a temple at Phrixa in [[Elis]], reportedly built by [[Clymenus]], she was known as '''Cydonia''' (Κυδωνία),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |last=Schmitz |first=Leonhard |title=Cydonia|editor-last=Smith |editor-first = William |encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] |volume=1 |page=910 |place=Boston, MA |year=1867 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is possibly connected to Greek ''kũdos'' (κῦδος &quot;glory&quot;).

In the ''[[Iliad]]'' (4.514), the [[Homeric Hymns]], and in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', Athena is also given the curious epithet '''Tritogeneia''' (Τριτογένεια), whose significance remains unclear. It could mean various things, including &quot;Triton-born&quot;, perhaps indicating that the [[Triton (mythology)|homonymous sea-deity]] was her parent according to some early myths. In fact there is a myth relating the foster father relationship of this Triton towards the half-orphan Athena, whom he raised besides his own daughter [[Pallas (daughter of Triton)|Pallas]]. [[Karl Kerényi]] suggests that &quot;Tritogeneia did not mean that she came into the world on any particular river or lake, but that she was born of the water itself; for the name Triton seems to be associated with water generally.&quot;{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=128}}&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|*tritoge/neia|Τριτογένεια|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' Athena is occasionally referred to as &quot;Tritonia&quot;.

[[File:Athena Carpegna Massimo.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Cult statue of Athena with the face of the Carpegna type (late 1st century BC to early 1st century AD), from the Piazza dell'Emporio, Rome]]

Another possible meaning may be &quot;triple-born&quot; or &quot;third-born&quot;, which may refer to a triad or to her status as the third daughter of Zeus or the fact she was born from Metis, Zeus, and herself; various legends list her as being the first child after Artemis and Apollo, though other legends identify her as Zeus' first child.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' II, 886–900.&lt;/ref&gt; Several scholars have suggested a connection to the [[Rigveda|Rigvedic]] god [[Trita]],{{sfn|Janda|2005|page=289-298}} who was sometimes grouped in a body of three mythological poets.{{sfn|Janda|2005|page=289-298}} Michael Janda has connected the myth of Trita to the scene in the ''[[Iliad]]'' in which the &quot;three brothers&quot; Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades divide the world between them, receiving the &quot;broad sky&quot;, the sea, and the underworld respectively.{{sfn|Janda|2005|page=293}}&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Iliad'' XV, 187–195.&lt;/ref&gt; Janda further connects the myth of Athena being born of the head (i.&amp;nbsp;e. the uppermost part) of Zeus, understanding ''Trito-'' (which perhaps originally meant &quot;the third&quot;) as another word for &quot;the sky&quot;.{{sfn|Janda|2005|page=293}} In Janda's analysis of Indo-European mythology, this heavenly sphere is also associated with the mythological body of water surrounding the inhabited world (''cfr.'' Triton's mother, [[Amphitrite]]).{{sfn|Janda|2005|page=293}}

She was given the epithet '''Hippia''' (Ἵππια &quot;of the horses&quot;, &quot;equestrian&quot;), as the inventor of the [[chariot]], and was worshiped under this title at Athens, [[Tegea]] and [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. As Athena Hippia she was given an alternative parentage: [[Poseidon]] and Polyphe, daughter of [[Oceanus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NymphePolyphe.html |title=Polyphe |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Cult/AthenaTitles.html |title=Titles of Athena |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each of these cities her temple frequently was the major temple on the acropolis.{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=140}}

The Greek biographer [[Plutarch]] (46–120 AD) refers to an instance during the Parthenon's construction of her being called '''Athena [[Hygieia]]''' (Ὑγίεια, i.&amp;nbsp;e. personified &quot;Health&quot;):

{{quote|A strange accident happened in the course of building, which showed that the goddess was not averse to the work, but was aiding and co-operating to bring it to perfection. One of the artificers, the quickest and the handiest workman among them all, with a slip of his foot fell down from a great height, and lay in a miserable condition, the physicians having no hope of his recovery. When [[Pericles]] was in distress about this, the goddess [Athena] appeared to him at night in a dream, and ordered a course of treatment, which he applied, and in a short time and with great ease cured the man. And upon this occasion it was that he set up a brass statue of Athena Hygeia, in the citadel near the altar, which they say was there before. But it was [[Phidias]] who wrought the goddess's image in gold, and he has his name inscribed on the pedestal as the workman of it.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Pericles'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pericles*.html#13 13.8].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] Athena was also given the surname Alcis, meaning 'the strong'.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| editorlink= William Smith (lexicographer) |editor-first = William | editor-last = Smith |title=Alcis  |work=[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] |publisher= John Murray| year = 1880 |volume = 1 |url = https://archive.org/stream/adictionarygree08smitgoog#page/n122/mode/1up | page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==

===Birth===
[[File:Amphora birth Athena Louvre F32.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Athena is &quot;born&quot; from Zeus's forehead as a result of him having swallowed her mother [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], as he grasps the clothing of [[Eileithyia]] on the right; [[black-figure pottery|black-figured]] [[amphora]], 550–525 BC, Louvre.]]

Although Athena appears before [[Zeus]] at [[Knossos]]—in [[Linear B]], as {{lang|gmy|𐀀𐀲𐀙𐀡𐀴𐀛𐀊}}, ''a-ta-na po-ti-ni-ja'', &quot;Mistress Athena&quot;{{sfn|Chadwick|1976|pages=88-89}}—in the Classical [[Olympian gods|Olympian pantheon]], Athena was remade as the favourite daughter of Zeus, born fully armed from his forehead.&lt;ref group=&quot;Notes&quot;&gt;Jane Ellen Harrison's famous characterization of this myth-element as, &quot;a desperate theological expedient to rid an earth-born Kore of her matriarchal conditions&quot; (Harrison 1922:302) has never been refuted nor confirmed.&lt;/ref&gt; The story of her birth comes in several versions.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|pages=118-122}} In the version recounted by [[Hesiod]] in his ''[[Theogony]]'', Zeus lay with [[Metis]], the goddess of crafty thought and wisdom,{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=118}} but he immediately feared the consequences{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=118}} because Gaia and [[Ouranos]] had prophesized that Metis would bear children wiser than he himself.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|pages=118-119}}&lt;ref group=&quot;Notes&quot;&gt;The prophecy concerning [[Thetis]] bears certain similarities to this account.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to prevent this, Zeus swallowed Metis,{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=119}} but it was too late because Metis had already conceived.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=119}}&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''[[Theogony]]'' 890ff and 924ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually Zeus experienced an enormous headache;{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|pages=119-120}} [[Prometheus]], [[Hephaestus]], [[Hermes]], [[Ares]], or Palaemon (depending on the sources examined){{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=120}} cleaved Zeus’ head with the double-headed [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[axe]], the ''[[labrys]]''.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=120}} Athena leaped from Zeus's head, fully grown and armed,{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=120}} with a shout—&quot;and pealed to the broad sky her clarion cry of war. And Ouranos trembled to hear, and Mother Gaia…&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Seventh Olympian Ode''&lt;/ref&gt; Plato, in the ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'', attributes the cult of Athena to the culture of [[Crete]], introduced, he thought, from Libya during the dawn of Greek culture. Classical myths thereafter note that [[Hera]] was so annoyed at Zeus for having produced a child that she conceived and bore [[Hephaestus]] by [[parthenogenesis|herself]], but in ''Imagines'' [https://archive.org/stream/imagines00philuoft#page/246/mode/2up 2. 27] (trans. Fairbanks), the third-century AD Greek rhetorician [[Philostratus the Elder]] writes that Hera &quot;rejoices&quot; at Athena's birth &quot;as though Athena were her daughter also.&quot;
In accordance with this mythological tradition, Plato, in ''[[Cratylus]]'' (407B), gives the etymology of her name as signifying &quot;the mind of god&quot;, ''theou noesis''. The second-century AD Christian apologist [[Justin Martyr]] takes issue with those pagans who erect at springs images of [[Persephone|Kore]], whom he interprets as Athena:

&lt;blockquote&gt;They said that Athena was the daughter of Zeus not from intercourse, but when the god had in mind the making of a world through a word (''[[logos]]'') his first thought was Athena.&lt;ref&gt;Justin, ''Apology'' 64.5, quoted in Robert McQueen Grant, ''Gods and the One God'', vol. 1:155, who observes that it is [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] &quot;who similarly identifies Athena with 'forethought'{{-&quot;}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Pallas Athena===
The  tradition regarding Athena's parentage involves some of her more mysterious [[epithet]]s: Pallas, as in the ancient-Greek {{lang|grc|Παλλάς Ἀθήνη}} (also Pallantias) and Tritogeneia (also Trito, Tritonis, Tritoneia, Tritogenes). A distant archaic separate entity named Pallas is invoked as Athena's father, sister, foster sister, companion, or opponent in battle. One of these is [[Pallas (daughter of Triton)|Pallas]], a daughter of [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] (a sea god) and, according to some later sources, a childhood friend of Athena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NymphePallas.html |title=Pallas |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In every case, Athena kills Pallas, accidentally, and thereby gains the name for herself. In one telling, they practice the arts of war together until one day they have a falling out. As Pallas is about to strike Athena, Zeus intervenes. With Pallas stunned by a blow from Zeus, Athena takes advantage and kills her. Distraught over what she has done, Athena takes the name Pallas for herself.

When Pallas is Athena's father, the events, including her birth, are located near a body of water named Triton or [[Lake Tritonis|Tritonis]]. When Pallas is Athena's sister or foster-sister, Athena's father or foster-father is [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]], the son and herald of [[Poseidon]]. Athena may be called the daughter of Poseidon and a nymph named Tritonis, without involving Pallas. Likewise, Pallas may be Athena's father or opponent, without involving Triton.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, Robert, ''The Greek Myths I'', &quot;The Birth of Athena&quot;, 8.a., p. 51. The story comes from [[Libya]]n (modern [[Berber people|Berbers]]) where the Greek Athena and the Egyptian [[Neith]] blend into one deity. The story is not often referenced because some of the details are contradicted by other, better-documented theories. Frazer, vol. 2 p.41&lt;/ref&gt; On this topic, Walter Burkert says &quot;she is the Pallas of Athens, ''Pallas Athenaie'', just as Hera of Argos is ''Here Argeie''.{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=139}} Burkert notes that the Athenians sometimes simply called Athena &quot;the Goddess&quot;, ''hē theós'' (ἡ θεός), certainly an ancient title.{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=139}}

In fact, &quot;Pallas&quot; is derived either from {{lang|grc|πάλλω}}, &quot;brandish&quot; (as a weapon), or, more likely, from {{lang|grc|παλλακίς}} and related words, &quot;youth, young woman.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chantraine, s.v.;  the ''New Pauly'' says the etymology is simply unknown&lt;/ref&gt;  The story that Athena kills a friend or relation called &quot;Pallas&quot; and takes the name to honor her is only attested quite late, in Apollodorus and Philodemus. It seems to have been invented to explain the name.&lt;ref&gt;''New Pauly'' s.v. Pallas&lt;/ref&gt;

Athena never had a consort or lover and is thus known as ''[[Athena Parthenos]]'', &quot;Virgin Athena&quot;.{{sfn|Kerényi|1952|pages=}} Her most famous temple, the [[Parthenon]], on the [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]] in [[Athens]] takes its name from this title.{{sfn|Kerényi|1952|pages=}} It is not merely an observation of her virginity, but a recognition of her role as enforcer of rules of sexual modesty and ritual mystery.{{sfn|Kerényi|1952|pages=}} Even beyond recognition, the Athenians allotted the goddess value based on this pureness of virginity as it upheld a rudiment of female behavior in the patriarchal society.{{sfn|Kerényi|1952|pages=}} Kerényi's study and theory of Athena accredits her virginal epithet to be a result of the relationship to her father Zeus and a vital, cohesive piece of her character throughout the ages.{{sfn|Kerényi|1952|pages=}}

This role is expressed in a number of stories about Athena. [[Marinus of Neapolis]] reports that when Christians removed the statue of the Goddess from the [[Parthenon]], a beautiful woman appeared in a dream to [[Proclus]], a devotee of Athena, and announced that the ''&quot;Athenian Lady&quot;'' wished to dwell with him.&lt;ref&gt;Marinus of Samaria, ''&quot;The Life of Proclus or Concerning Happiness&quot;'', Translated by Kenneth S. Guthrie (1925), pp.15–55:30, retrieved 21 May 2007.[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/marinus_01_life_of_proclus.htm Marinus, ''Life of Proclus'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient mythographer [[Pseudo-Apollodorus]]{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=281}} records an archaic legend, which claims that [[Hephaestus]] once attempted to rape Athena, but she pushed him away, causing him to [[ejaculate]] on her thigh.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}}{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=143}} Athena wiped the [[semen]] off using a tuft of [[wool]],{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}}{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=143}} which she tossed into the dust,{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}}{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=143}} impregnating [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] and causing her to give birth to [[Erichthonius of Athens|Erichthonius]],{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}}{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=143}} whom Athena adopted as her own child.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}} The Roman mythographer [[Hyginus]]{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=281}} records a similar story in which Hephaestus demanded Zeus to let him marry Athena since he was the one who had smashed open Zeus's skull, allowing Athena to be born.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}} Zeus agreed to this and Hephaestus and Athena were married,{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}} but, when Hephaestus was about to consummate the union, Athena vanished from the bridal bed, causing him to ejaculate on the floor, thus impregnating Gaia with Erichthonius.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}}

The geographer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=281}} records that Athena placed the infant Erichthonius into a small chest{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=125}} (''cista''), which she entrusted to the care of the three daughters of [[Cecrops I|Cecrops]]: [[Herse]], [[Pandrosos]], and [[Aglaulus, daughter of Cecrops|Aglauros]] of Athens.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=125}} She warned the three sisters not the open the chest,{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=125}} but did not explain to them why or what was in it.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=125}} Aglauros, and possibly one of the other sisters,{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=125}} opened the chest.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=125}} Differing reports say that they either found that the child itself was a serpent, that it was guarded by a serpent, that it was guarded by two serpents, or that it had the legs of a serpent.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|pages=125-126}} In Pausanias's story, the two sisters were driven mad by the sight of the chest's contents and hurled themselves off the [[Acropolis]], dying instantly,{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=126}} but an Attic vase painting shows them being chased by the serpent off the edge of the cliff instead.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=126}} Erichthonius was one of the most important founding heroes of Athens{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=143}} and the legend of the daughters of Cecrops was a cult myth linked to the rituals of the [[Arrhephoria]] festival.{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=143}}

&lt;!-- Her role as the virgin mother of [[Erichthonius of Athens|Erichthonius]] was a relic of an archaic myth of the patron goddess of ''Athenai'' that preceded her placement among the Olympian pantheon. --&gt;
Another version of the myth of the Athenian maidens is told in ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' by the Roman poet [[Ovid]] (43 BC{{snds}}17 AD); in this late variant [[Hermes]] falls in love with Herse. Herse, Aglaulus, and Pandrosus go to the temple to offer sacrifices to Athena. Hermes demands help from Aglaulus to seduce Herse. Aglaulus demands money in exchange. Hermes gives her the money the sisters have already offered to Athena. As punishment for Aglaulus's greed, Athena asks the goddess [[Invidia|Envy]] to make Aglaulus jealous of Herse. When Hermes arrives to seduce Herse, Aglaulus stands in his way instead of helping him as she had agreed. He turns her to stone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses'', X. Aglaura, Book II, 708–751; XI. The Envy, Book II, 752–832.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medusa and Tiresias====
[[File:Gorgona pushkin.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Classical Greek depiction of [[Medusa]] from the fourth century BC]]

In a late myth, [[Medusa]], unlike her sister [[Gorgon]]s, came to be viewed by the Greeks of the 5th century as a beautiful mortal that served as priestess in Athena's temple. Poseidon lusted after Medusa, and decided to rape her in the temple of Athena, refusing to allow her vow of chastity to stand in his way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/bogan/medusamyth.htm |title= Medusa in Myth and Literary History |accessdate= 2010-01-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100123102204/http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/bogan/medusamyth.htm| archivedate= 23 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon discovering the desecration of her temple, Athena changed Medusa's form to match that of her sister Gorgons as punishment. Medusa's hair turned into snakes, her lower body was transformed also, and meeting her gaze would turn any living man to stone. In the earliest myths, there is only one Gorgon, but there are two snakes that form a belt around her waist.

In one version of the [[Tiresias]] myth, Tiresias stumbled upon Athena bathing, and he was struck blind by her to ensure he would never again see what man was not intended to see but having lost his eyesight, he was given a special gift—to be able to understand the language of the birds and thus foretell the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pseudo-Apollodorus of Athens|first1=--|translator-last=Frazer|translator-first=Sir James George|title=The Library|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D6%3Asection%3D7|website=Perseus|publisher=Tufts University|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Odyssey]]'', [[Odysseus]]' cunning and shrewd nature quickly wins Athena's favour.{{sfn|Jenkyns|2016|page=19}} For the first part of the poem, however, she largely is confined to aiding him only from ''afar'', mainly by implanting thoughts in his head during his journey home from Troy. Her guiding actions reinforce her role as the &quot;protectress of heroes,&quot; or, as mythologian [[Walter Friedrich Otto]] dubbed her, the &quot;goddess of nearness,&quot; due to her mentoring and motherly probing.&lt;ref&gt;W.F.Otto,''Die Gotter Griechenlands(55-77)''.Bonn:F.Cohen,1929&lt;/ref&gt; It is not until he washes up on the shore of the island of the [[Phaeacians]], where [[Nausicaa]] is washing her clothes that Athena arrives personally to provide more tangible assistance. She appears in Nausicaa's dreams to ensure that the princess rescues Odysseus and plays a role in his eventual escort to Ithaca.

Athena appears to Odysseus upon his arrival, disguised as a herdsman;{{sfn|Trahman|1952|pages=31–35}}{{sfn|Jenkyns|2016|page=19}} she initially lies and tells him that Penelope, his wife, has remarried and that he is believed to be dead,{{sfn|Trahman|1952|pages=31-35}} but Odysseus lies back to her, employing skillful prevarications to protect himself.{{sfn|Trahman|1952|page=35}} Impressed by his resolve and shrewdness, she reveals herself and tells him what he needs to know in order to win back his kingdom.{{sfn|Trahman|1952|pages=35-43}}{{sfn|Jenkyns|2016|page=19}} She disguises him as an elderly beggar so that he will not be recognized by the suitors or Penelope,{{sfn|Trahman|1952|pages=35-42}} and helps him to defeat the suitors.{{sfn|Trahman|1952|pages=35-42}}{{sfn|Jenkyns|2016|pages=19-20}}

Athena also appears to Odysseus's son Telemachos. Her actions lead him to travel around to Odysseus's comrades and ask about his father. He hears stories about some of Odysseus's journey. Athena's push for Telemachos's journey helps him grow into the man role, that his father once held.

She also plays a role in ending the resultant feud against the suitors' relatives. She instructs [[Laertes]] to throw his spear and to kill [[Eupeithes]], the father of [[Antinous son of Eupeithes|Antinous]].

===Judgment of Paris===
{{Main article|Judgement of Paris}}
[[File:Mengs, Urteil des Paris.jpg|thumb|bottom|upright=1.5|right|''Urteil des Paris'' by [[Anton Raphael Mengs]], c.{{nbsp}}1857. Paris is awarding the golden apple to Aphrodite; Athena is the one on the right with the scowl, shown facing away.]]

In one myth, all the gods and goddesses as well as various mortals were invited to the marriage of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]] (the eventual parents of [[Achilles]]). Only [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], goddess of discord, was not invited. She was annoyed at this, so she arrived with a golden apple inscribed with the word καλλίστῃ (kallistēi, &quot;for the fairest&quot;), which she threw among the goddesses. Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena all claimed to be the fairest, and thus the rightful owner of the apple.

The goddesses chose to place the matter before Zeus, who, not wanting to favor one of the goddesses, put the choice into the hands of Paris, a [[Troy|Trojan]] prince. After bathing in the spring of [[Mount Ida]] where Troy was situated, the goddesses appeared before Paris for his decision. The goddesses undressed before him to be evaluated, either at his request or by their own choice.

Still, Paris could not decide, as all three were ideally beautiful, so they resorted to bribes. Hera tried to bribe Paris with control over all [[Asia]] and [[Europe]], while Athena offered wisdom, fame and glory in battle, but Aphrodite came forth and whispered to Paris that if he were to choose her as the fairest he would have the most beautiful mortal woman in the world as a wife, and he accordingly chose her. This woman was [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], who was, unfortunately for Paris, already married to King [[Menelaus]] of [[Sparta#Prehistory|Sparta]]. The other two goddesses were enraged by this and, as a direct result, sided with the Greeks in the [[Trojan War]].

===Roman fable of Arachne===

[[File:René-Antoine Houasse - Minerve et Arachne (Versailles).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|''[[Minerva]] and [[Arachne]]'' by [[René-Antoine Houasse]] (1706)]]

The [[fable]] of [[Arachne]] is a late Roman addition to Classical [[Greek mythology]]&lt;ref group=&quot;Notes&quot;&gt;The Arachne narrative is in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' (vi.5–54 and 129–145) and mentioned in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Georgics]]'', iv, 246.&lt;/ref&gt; that does not appear in any Greek texts from the [[Classical Greece|Classical Era]] or in the myth repertoire of the Attic vase-painters. Arachne's name means ''spider'' in ancient Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)ra/xnh|ἀράχνη}}, {{LSJ|a)ra/xnhs|ἀράχνης|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Arachne was the daughter of a famous dyer in [[Tyrian purple]] in Hypaipa of [[Lydia]], and a weaving student of Athena. She became so conceited of her skill as a weaver that she began claiming that her skill was greater than that of Athena herself.

Athena gave Arachne a chance to redeem herself by assuming the form of an old woman and warning Arachne not to offend the deities. Arachne scoffed and wished for a weaving contest, so she could prove her skill.

Athena wove the scene of her victory over [[Poseidon]] that had inspired her patronage of Athens. According to Ovid's Latin narrative, Arachne's tapestry featured twenty-one episodes of the infidelity of the deities, including [[Zeus]] being unfaithful with [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]], with [[Europa (mythical)|Europa]], and with [[Danaë]]. Athena admitted that Arachne's work was flawless, but was outraged at Arachne's offensive choice of subjects that displayed the failings and transgressions of the deities. Finally, losing her temper, Athena destroyed Arachne's tapestry and loom, striking it with her shuttle.

Athena then struck Arachne with her staff, which changed her into a spider. In some versions, the destruction of her loom leads Arachne to hang herself in despair; Athena takes pity on her, and transforms her into a spider. In the aforementioned version, Arachne weaved scenes of joy while Athena weaved scenes of horror.

The fable suggests that the origin of weaving lay in imitation of spiders and that it was considered to have been perfected first in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]].&lt;!--no citation required: this is merely the superficial reading--&gt;

==Classical art==
[[File:NAMABG-Aphaia Athena statue.JPG|thumb|Restoration of the [[polychrome]] decoration of the Athena statue from the [[Aphaea]] temple at [[Aegina]], c.{{nbsp}}490 BC (from the exposition &quot;Bunte Götter&quot; by the Munich [[Glyptothek]])]]

Classically, Athena is portrayed wearing a full-length [[chiton (costume)|chiton]], and sometimes in armor, with her helmet raised high on the forehead to reveal the image of [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]]. Her shield bears at its centre the aegis with the head of the gorgon (gorgoneion) in the center and snakes around the edge. It is in this standing posture that she was depicted in [[Phidias]]'s famous lost [[Chryselephantine|gold and ivory]] statue of her, 36 m tall, the ''[[Athena Parthenos]]'' in the [[Parthenon]]. Athena also often is depicted with an [[owl]] sitting on one of her shoulders.&lt;ref group=&quot;Notes&quot;&gt;The owl's role as a symbol of wisdom originates in this association with Athena.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Mourning Athena]]'' is a relief sculpture that dates around 460 BC and portrays a weary Athena resting on a staff.&lt;!-- Better interpretation? --&gt; In earlier, archaic portraits of Athena in [[black-figure pottery]], the goddess retains some of her Minoan-Mycenaean character, such as great bird wings although this is not true of archaic sculpture such as those of [[Aphaean Athena]], where Athena has subsumed an earlier, invisibly numinous—''[[Aphaea]]''—goddess with Cretan connections in her ''mythos''.

Apart from her attributes, there seems to be a relative consensus in late sculpture from the Classical period, the 5th century onward, as to what Athena looked like. Most noticeable in the face is perhaps the full round strong, chin with a high nose that has a high bridge as a natural extension of the forehead. The eyes typically are somewhat deeply set. The unsmiling lips are usually full, but the mouth is depicted fairly narrow, usually just slightly wider than the nose. The neck is somewhat long. The net result is a serene, serious, somewhat aloof, and very classical beauty.

Early Christian writers such as [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Firmicus]] denigrated Athena as representative of all the things that were detestable about paganism;{{snf|Deacy|2008|pages=141-144}} they condemned her as &quot;immodest and immoral&quot;.{{snf|Deacy|2008|page=144}} During the Middle Ages, however, many attributes of Athena were given to the [[Virgin Mary]],{{snf|Deacy|2008|page=144}} who, in fourth century portrayals, was often depicted wearing the [[Gorgoneion]].{{snf|Deacy|2008|page=144}} Some even viewed the Virgin Mary as a warrior maiden, much like Athena Parthenos;{{snf|Deacy|2008|page=144}} one anecdote tells that the Virgin Mary once appeared upon the walls of [[Constantinople]] when it was under siege by the Avars, clutching a spear and urging the people to fight.{{snf|Deacy|2008|pages=144-145}} During the Middle Ages, Athena became widely used as a Christian symbol and allegory; she appeared on the family crests of certain noble houses.{{snf|Deacy|2008|pages=146-148}}

During the Renaissance, Athena donned the mantle of patron of the arts and human endeavor;{{snf|Deacy|2008|pages=145-146}} allegorical paintings involving Athena were a favorite of the Italian Renaissance painters.{{snf|Deacy|2008|pages=145-146}} During the [[French Revolution]], statues of pagan gods were torn down all throughout France, but statues of Athena were not.{{snf|Deacy|2008|page=148}} Instead, Athena was transformed into the personification of freedom and the republic and a statue of the goddess stood in the center of the [[Place de la Revolution]] in Paris.{{snf|Deacy|2008|page=148}} In the years following the Revolution, artistic representations of Athena proliferated.{{snf|Deacy|2008|pages=148-149}}

For over a century, [[Parthenon (Nashville)|a full-scale replica of the Parthenon]] has stood in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].{{sfn|Garland|2008|page=330}} In 1990, the curators added a gilded forty-two foot (12.5 m) tall [[Athena Parthenos|replica of Phidias's ''Athena Parthenos'']], built from concrete and fiberglass.{{sfn|Garland|2008|page=330}} The state [[seal of California]] features an image of Athena (or Minerva) kneeling next to a brown grizzly bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learncalifornia.org/doc.asp?id=97 |title=Symbols of the Seal of California |publisher=LearnCalifornia.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124160916/http://learncalifornia.org/doc.asp?id=97 |archivedate=24 November 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Medallion Front.jpg|thumb|Modern silver medallion depicting Athena from the Academie voor Beeldende Kunst en Technische Wetenshappen in [[Rotterdam|Rotterdam, the Netherlands]]]]

Athena is a natural patron of universities: she is the symbol of the [[Darmstadt University of Technology]], in Germany, and the [[Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro|Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]], in Brazil. Her image can be found in the shields of the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters and the Faculty of Sciences of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], where her owl is the symbol of the Faculty of Chemistry.  Her helmet appears upon the shield of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York. At [[Bryn Mawr College]] in Pennsylvania a statue of Athena (a replica of the original bronze one in the arts and archaeology library) resides in the Great Hall. It is traditional at exam time for students to leave offerings to the goddess with a note asking for good luck, or to repent for accidentally breaking any of the college's numerous other traditions. Athena's owl also serves as the mascot of the college, and one of the college hymns is &quot;Pallas Athena&quot;. Pallas Athena is the tutelary goddess of the international social fraternity [[Phi Delta Theta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pdt&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phideltatheta.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=20&amp;Itemid=122 |title=Phi Delta Theta International - Symbols |accessdate=2008-06-07 |publisher=phideltatheta.org |date= | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080607045215/http://www.phideltatheta.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=20&amp;Itemid=122| archivedate= 7 June 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her owl is also a symbol of the fraternity.&lt;ref name=&quot;pdt&quot;/&gt;

[[Jean Boucher (artist)|Jean Boucher]]'s statue of the seated skeptical thinker [[Ernest Renan]] caused great controversy when it was installed in Tréguier, [[Brittany]] in 1902. Renan's 1862 biography of Jesus had denied his divinity, and he had written the &quot;[http://www.lexilogos.com/document/renan/acropolis.htm Prayer on the Acropolis]&quot; addressed to the goddess Athena. The statue was placed in the square fronted by the cathedral. Renan's head was turned away from the building, while Athena, beside him, was depicted raising her arm, which was interpreted as indicating a challenge to the church during an anti-clerical phase in French official culture. The installation was accompanied by a mass protest from local Roman Catholics and a religious service against the growth of [[skepticism]] and [[secularism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeanboucher.net/?d=monuments&amp;p=monuments |title=Musee Virtuel Jean Boucher |publisher=Jeanboucher.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athena has been used numerous times as a symbol of a republic by different countries and appears on currency as she did on the ancient [[drachma]] of Athens.
Athena (Minerva) is the subject of the $50 1915-S Panama-Pacific [[commemorative coin]]. At 2.5 troy oz (78 g) gold, this is the largest (by [[weight]]) coin ever produced by the [[United States Mint|U.S. Mint]]. This was the first $50 coin issued by the U.S. Mint and no higher was produced until the production of the $100 platinum coins in 1997. Of course, in terms of face-value in adjusted dollars, the 1915 is the highest denomination ever issued by the U.S. Mint.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}
