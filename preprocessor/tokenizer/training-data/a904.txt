<comment>this date is less important then the first swearing in. See no reason why it should be in the intro. Maybe we should add the date of becoming a citizen instead.</comment>

'''Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|w|ɔːr|t|s|ən|ɛ|ɡ|ər}}; {{IPA-de|ˈaɐ̯nɔlt ˈalɔʏs ˈʃvaɐ̯tsn̩ˌɛɡɐ|lang}}; born July 30, 1947) is an [[Austrian-American]] actor, producer, businessman, investor, author, philanthropist, activist, politician, and former professional bodybuilder who holds both Austrian and American citizenship. He served two terms as the [[List of Governors of California|38th Governor of California]] from 2003 to 2011.

Schwarzenegger began [[weight training]] at the age of 15. He won the Mr. Universe title at age 20 and went on to win the [[Mr. Olympia]] contest seven times, remaining a prominent presence in bodybuilding and writing many books and articles on the sport. He is widely considered to be among the greatest bodybuilders of all time as well as bodybuilding's biggest icon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.illpumpyouup.com/articles/arnold-schwarzenegger-the-greatest-bodybuilder-ever.htm |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger - The Greatest Bodybuilder Ever - IllPumpYouUp.com |work=illpumpyouup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger gained worldwide fame as a Hollywood action film icon. His breakthrough film was the [[sword-and-sorcery]] epic ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' in 1982, a box office hit that resulted in [[Conan the Destroyer|a sequel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;katzfilm&quot; /&gt;

In 1984, Schwarzenegger appeared in [[James Cameron]]'s science-fiction thriller film ''[[The Terminator]]'', a critical and commercial success. Schwarzenegger subsequently reprised the [[Terminator (character)|Terminator]] character in [[Terminator (franchise)|the franchise]]'s later installments: ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991), ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'' (2003), and ''[[Terminator Genisys]]'' (2015).&lt;ref name=&quot;katzfilm&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fanleam&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Leamer |first=Laurence |title=Fantastic: The life of Arnold Schwarzenegger |year=2005 |publisher=St Martin's Press |isbn=978-0-312-33338-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has appeared in a number of successful films, such as ''[[Commando (1985 film)|Commando]]'' (1985), ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]'' (1987), ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' (1987), ''[[Twins (1988 film)|Twins]]'' (1988), ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990), ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]'' (1990), and ''[[True Lies]]'' (1994). In 2015, it was announced that Schwarzenegger would replace [[Donald Trump]] as the host of ''[[The Celebrity Apprentice]]'', though he left after [[The New Celebrity Apprentice|one season]] due to conflicts caused by Trump's remarks. Schwarzenegger was nicknamed &quot;the Austrian Oak&quot; in his bodybuilding days, &quot;Arnie&quot; during his acting career, and &quot;The Governator&quot; (a [[portmanteau]] of &quot;Governor&quot; and &quot;The [[Terminator (character)|Terminator]]&quot;) during his political career.

As a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], Schwarzenegger was first elected on October 7, 2003, in [[California gubernatorial recall election|a special recall election]] to replace then-Governor [[Gray Davis]]. He was sworn in on November 17, to serve the remainder of Davis' term. He was then re-elected in the [[2006 California gubernatorial election]], to serve a full term as governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/05/AR2007010501386.html |title=Schwarzenegger Sworn in for Second Term |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=April 23, 2008 |last=Kurtzman |first=Laura |work=The Washington Post |date=January 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he completed his second term as governor and returned to acting.

He married Aurelia on October 20, 1945; he was 38 and she was 23. According to Schwarzenegger, both of his parents were very strict: &quot;Back then in Austria it was a very different world ... if we did something bad or we disobeyed our parents, [[wikt:spare the rod and spoil the child|the rod was not spared]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;askarnold1&quot; /&gt; Schwarzenegger grew up in a [[Roman Catholic]] family who attended [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] every Sunday.&lt;ref name=&quot;tmas&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Andrews |first=Nigel |title=True Myths of Arnold Schwarzenegger |year=2003 |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=978-1-58234-465-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Herman |title=Ah-nold in cross hairs Rivals blast Calif. front-runner |date=August 11, 2003 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/ah-nold-cross-hairs-rivals-blast-calif-front-runner-article-1.522414 |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |accessdate=August 20, 2012 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a boy, Schwarzenegger played several sports, heavily influenced by his father.&lt;ref name=&quot;tmas&quot; /&gt; He picked up his first [[barbell]] in 1960, when his [[association football|soccer]] coach took his team to a local gym.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot; /&gt; At the age of 14, he chose [[bodybuilding]] over soccer as a career.&lt;ref name=&quot;katzfilm&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Katz |first=Ephraim |title=Film Encyclopedia |year=2006 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0-06-074214-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Profile: Arnold Schwarzenegger |date=August 31, 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3131155.stm |publisher=BBC |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101220131/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3131155.stm |archivedate=November 1, 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later said, &quot;I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start Olympic lifting.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;askarnold1&quot; /&gt; However, his official website biography claims that &quot;at 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Mr. Everything |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/athlete/mreverything/index.asp?sec=athlete&amp;subsec=mreverything |publisher=Schwarzenegger.com |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416234020/http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/athlete/mreverything/index.asp?sec=athlete&amp;subsec=mreverything |archivedate=April 16, 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a speech in 2001, he said, &quot;My own plan formed when I was 14 years old.

Schwarzenegger took to visiting a gym in [[Graz]], where he also frequented the local movie theaters to see bodybuilding idols such as [[Reg Park]], [[Steve Reeves]], and [[Johnny Weissmuller]] on the big screen.&lt;ref name=&quot;askarnold1&quot; /&gt; When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: &quot;As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible, when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve.&quot; In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot; /&gt; He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends, when it was usually closed, so that he could train. &quot;It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I didn't do it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;askarnold1&quot; /&gt; When Schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy, he replied: &quot;I was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels. The first real movie I saw, that I distinctly remember, was a [[John Wayne]] movie.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;askarnold1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Ask Arnold |year=2000 |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/news/askarnold/news_askarnold_eng_legacy_444.asp?sec=news&amp;subsec=askarnold |publisher=Schwarzenegger.com |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523203926/http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/news/askarnold/news_askarnold_eng_legacy_444.asp?sec=news&amp;subsec=askarnold |archivedate=May 23, 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger's brother, Meinhard, died in a car crash on May 20, 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot; /&gt; He was [[drunk driving|driving drunk]] and died instantly. Schwarzenegger did not attend his funeral.&lt;ref name=&quot;wl&quot; /&gt; Meinhard was engaged to Erika Knapp, and they had a three-year-old son named [[Patrick M. Knapp Schwarzenegger|Patrick]]. Schwarzenegger paid for Patrick's education and helped him to move to the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;wl&quot; /&gt; Gustav died on December 13, 1972, from a [[stroke]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot; /&gt; In ''[[Pumping Iron]]'', Schwarzenegger claimed that he did not attend his father's funeral because he was training for a bodybuilding contest. Later, he and the film's producer said this story was taken from another bodybuilder to show the extremes some would go to for their sport and to make Schwarzenegger's image colder to create controversy for the film.&lt;ref&gt;Interview in ''Pumping Iron&amp;nbsp;– 25th Anniversary Edition'' DVD extras&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Baker, his first serious girlfriend, recalled that he informed her of his father's death without emotion and that he never spoke of his brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;DT2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=The girl who can't escape Arnie |date=October 6, 2003 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3603696/The-girl-who-cant-escape-Arnie.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |first=Oliver |last=Poole |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410221914/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2003/10/02/bfarni02.xml&amp;page=1 |archivedate=April 10, 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, he has given at least three versions of why he was absent from his father's funeral.&lt;ref name=&quot;wl&quot; /&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' in 2004, Schwarzenegger told how he suffered what &quot;would now be called child abuse&quot; at the hands of his father: &quot;My hair was pulled. I was hit with belts. So was the kid next door. It was just the way it was. Many of the children I've seen were broken by their parents, which was the German-Austrian mentality. They didn't want to create an individual. It was all about conforming. I was one who did not conform, and whose will could not be broken. Therefore, I became a rebel. Every time I got hit, and every time someone said, 'You can't do this,' I said, 'This is not going to be for much longer, because I'm going to move out of here. I want to be rich. I want to be somebody.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nazi&quot; /&gt;

===Early adulthood===
Schwarzenegger served in the [[Austrian Armed Forces|Austrian Army]] in 1965 to fulfill the one year of service required at the time of all 18-year-old Austrian males.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot; /&gt; During his army service, he won the Junior Mr. Europe contest.&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot; /&gt; He went [[AWOL]] during basic training so he could take part in the competition and spent a week in military prison: &quot;Participating in the competition meant so much to me that I didn't carefully think through the consequences.&quot; He won another bodybuilding contest in Graz, at Steirerhof Hotel (where he placed second). He was voted best built man of Europe, which made him famous. &quot;The [[Universe Championships|Mr. Universe]] title was my ticket to America—the land of opportunity, where I could become a star and get rich.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;per&quot; /&gt; Schwarzenegger made his first plane trip in 1966, attending the [[Universe_Championships#History|NABBA Mr. Universe]] competition in London.&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot; /&gt; He would come in second in the Mr. Universe competition, not having the muscle definition of American winner [[Chester Yorton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot; /&gt;

Charles &quot;Wag&quot; Bennett, one of the judges at the 1966 competition, was impressed with Schwarzenegger and he offered to coach him. As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in [[Forest Gate|Forest Gate, London]]. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs. Staying in the [[East End of London]] helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article4862637.ece |location=London |work=The Times |title=Wag Bennett bodybuilder who helped Arnold Schwarzenegger |date=October 2, 2008 |first=Lindsay |last=McIntosh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staff, [http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/777625?view=synopsis Arnold Schwarzenegger: Made in Britain], [[British Film Institute]]. Retrieved October 3, 2008. &quot;Wag and Dianne Bennett, an East End couple who gave Arnie a home for three years,&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Living with the Bennetts also changed him as a person: &quot;Being with them made me so much more sophisticated. When you're the age I was then, you're always looking for approval, for love, for attention and also for guidance. At the time, I wasn't really aware of that. But now, looking back, I see that the Bennett family fulfilled all those needs. Especially my need to be the best in the world. To be recognized and to feel unique and special. They saw that I needed that care and attention and love.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Park&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=An Austrian hick in London: Arnie's early years |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/terminator-genisys/arnold-schwarzenegger-early-life-bodybuilding/ |publisher=The Telegraph |date=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move to the U.S.===
[[File:Reagan+Schwarzenegger1984.jpg|thumb|upright|Schwarzenegger with President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1984]]
Schwarzenegger, who dreamed of moving to the U.S. since the age of 10, and saw bodybuilding as the avenue through which to do so,&lt;ref name=&quot;LAWarn&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Bill |last=Bradley |title=Mr. California |date=November 20, 2002 |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2002-11-28/news/mr-california/ |work=LA Weekly |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; realized his dream by moving to the United States in September 1968 at the age of 21, speaking little English.&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot; /&gt; There he trained at [[Gold's Gym]] in [[Venice, Los Angeles]], California, under [[Joe Weider]]. From 1970 to 1974, one of Schwarzenegger's weight training partners was [[Ric Drasin]], a [[professional wrestler]] who designed the original Gold's Gym logo in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, Randy (October 21, 2003).

In 1970, at age 23, he captured his first [[Mr. Olympia]] title in New York, and would go on to win the title a total of seven times.&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot; /&gt;

The immigration law firm Siskind &amp; Susser has stated that Schwarzenegger may have been an [[illegal immigrant]] at some point in the late 1960s or early 1970s because of violations in the terms of his [[visa (document)|visa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Possible Visa Violations&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Siskind |last=Bland |title=Schwarzenegger May Have Violated Terms Of Non-Immigrant Visa |date=September 4, 2007 |url=http://www.visalaw.com/03sep4/15sep403.html |work=VISALAW.COM |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220094159/http://www.visalaw.com/03sep4/15sep403.html |archivedate=February 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[LA Weekly]]'' would later say in 2002 that Schwarzenegger is the most famous immigrant in America, who &quot;overcame a thick Austrian accent and transcended the unlikely background of bodybuilding to become the biggest movie star in the world in the 1990s&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LAWarn&quot; /&gt;

In 1977, Schwarzenegger's autobiography/weight-training guide ''Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder'' became a huge success.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot; /&gt; In 1977 he posed for the gay magazine ''[[After Dark (magazine)|After Dark]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger A name to be reckoned with |url=http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/actors/arnold-schwarzenegger/ |website=www.rotten.com |accessdate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paslay |first1=Christopher |title=The Village Proposal: Education as a Shared Responsibility |date=September 1, 2011 |publisher=R&amp;L Education |page=146 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6rU59neX34C&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=schwarzenegger+%22after+dark%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uZPCXNpvni&amp;sig=eDCpcp1GwTXc44lMCtCkpTqAxFw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKvseLm4DMAhUJ1xoKHemMAfc4ChDoAQhUMAk#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After taking English classes at [[Santa Monica College]] in California, he earned a BA by correspondence from the [[University of Wisconsin–Superior]], in international marketing of fitness and business administration in 1979.

He tells that during this time he ran into a friend who told him that he was teaching [[Transcendental Meditation]] (TM), which prompted Schwarzenegger to reveal he had been struggling with [[anxiety]] for the first time in his life: &quot;Even today, I still benefit from [the year of TM] because I don't merge and bring things together and see everything as one big problem.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.in/Arnold-Schwarzenegger-says-a-year-of-practicing-Transcendental-Meditation-in-the-70s-changed-his-life/articleshow/46125489.cms |work=Richard Feloni |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger says a year of practicing Transcendental Meditation in the '70s changed his life |date=February 4, 2015 |accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger is considered among the most important figures in the history of bodybuilding, and his legacy is commemorated in the [[Arnold Classic]] annual bodybuilding competition. He has remained a prominent face in bodybuilding long after his retirement, in part because of his ownership of gyms and fitness magazines. He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows.

For many years, he wrote a monthly column for the bodybuilding magazines ''[[Muscle &amp; Fitness]]'' and ''[[Flex (magazine)|Flex]]''. Shortly after being elected governor, he was appointed executive editor of both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 a year to the Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. When the deal, including the contract that gave Schwarzenegger at least $1 million a year, was made public in 2005, many criticized it as being a conflict of interest since the governor's office made decisions concerning regulation of dietary supplements in California.&lt;ref name=&quot;megerian&quot;&gt;Megerian, Chris. (March 1, 2013). [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-schwarzenegger-20130302,0,1141770.story ''Schwarzenegger to be executive editor of magazines''.] ''Los Angeles Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Schwarzenegger relinquished the executive editor role in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;megerian&quot; /&gt; American Media Inc., which owns ''Muscle &amp; Fitness'' and ''Flex'', announced in March 2013 that Schwarzenegger had accepted their renewed offer to be executive editor of the magazines.&lt;ref name=&quot;megerian&quot; /&gt;

One of the first competitions he won was the Junior Mr. Europe contest in 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot; /&gt; He won Mr. Europe the following year, at age 19.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot; /&gt; He would go on to compete in, and win, many bodybuilding contests. His bodybuilding victories included five Mr. Universe (4&amp;nbsp;– [[National Amateur Body-Builders' Association|NABBA]] [England], 1&amp;nbsp;– [[International Federation of BodyBuilders|IFBB]] [USA]) wins, and seven Mr. Olympia wins, a record which would stand until [[Lee Haney]] won his eighth consecutive Mr. Olympia title in 1991.

Schwarzenegger continues to work out even today. When asked about his personal training during the 2011 [[Arnold Classic]] he said that he was still working out a half an hour with weights every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPEVHihgmHc&amp;feature=related |title=Ask Arnold Training Seminar – Arnold Schwarzenegger Talks Bodybuilding Advice – Part 1 |publisher=YouTube |date=March 6, 2011 |accessdate=October 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Powerlifting/weightlifting===
During Schwarzenegger's early years in bodybuilding, he also competed in several [[Olympic weightlifting]] and [[powerlifting]] contests. Schwarzenegger won two weightlifting contests in 1964 and 1965, as well as two powerlifting contests in 1966 and 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;gmv.com.au&quot; /&gt;

In 1967, Schwarzenegger won the [[Munich]] stone-lifting contest, in which a stone weighing 508 German pounds (254&amp;nbsp;kg/560&amp;nbsp;lbs.) is lifted between the legs while standing on two foot rests.

===Mr. Olympia===
Schwarzenegger's goal was to become the greatest bodybuilder in the world, which meant becoming [[Mr. Olympia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot; /&gt; His first attempt was in 1969, when he lost to three-time champion [[Sergio Oliva]]. However, Schwarzenegger came back in 1970 and won the competition, making him the youngest ever Mr. Olympia at the age of 23, a record he still holds to this day.&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot; /&gt;

He continued his winning streak in the 1971–74 competitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot; /&gt; In 1975, Schwarzenegger was once again in top form, and won the title for the sixth consecutive time,&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot; /&gt; beating [[Franco Columbu]]. After the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, Schwarzenegger announced his retirement from professional bodybuilding.&lt;ref name=&quot;mrever&quot; /&gt;

Months before the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, filmmakers George Butler and Robert Fiore persuaded Schwarzenegger to compete, in order to film his training in the bodybuilding documentary called ''[[Pumping Iron]].'' Schwarzenegger had only three months to prepare for the competition, after losing significant weight to appear in the film ''[[Stay Hungry (film)|Stay Hungry]]'' with [[Jeff Bridges]]. [[Lou Ferrigno]] proved not to be a threat, and a lighter-than-usual Schwarzenegger convincingly won the 1975 Mr. Olympia.

Schwarzenegger came out of retirement, however, to compete in the 1980 Mr. Olympia.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot; /&gt; Schwarzenegger was training for his role in ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan]]'', and he got into such good shape because of the running, horseback riding and sword training, that he decided he wanted to win the Mr. Olympia contest one last time. He kept this plan a secret, in the event that a training accident would prevent his entry and cause him to lose face. Schwarzenegger had been hired to provide [[color commentary]] for network television, when he announced at the eleventh hour that while he was there: &quot;Why not compete?&quot; Schwarzenegger ended up winning the event with only seven weeks of preparation. After being declared Mr. Olympia for a seventh time, Schwarzenegger then officially retired from competition.

===Steroid use===
Schwarzenegger has admitted to using performance-enhancing [[anabolic steroid]]s while they were legal, writing in 1977 that &quot;steroids were helpful to me in maintaining muscle size while on a strict diet in preparation for a contest. I did not use them for muscle growth, but rather for muscle maintenance when [[Weight cutting|cutting up]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Conan the Politician |publisher=[[ESPN]] |url=http://espn.go.com/columns/farrey_tom/1655597.html |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |last=Farrey |first=Tom |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329223151/http://espn.go.com/columns/farrey_tom/1655597.html |archivedate=March 29, 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has called the drugs &quot;tissue building&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnold Steroids&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Arnold &amp; Steroids: Truth Revealed |publisher=get2net |url=http://hjem.get2net.dk/JamesBond/www/artikler/steroidemisbrug/arnoldandsteroids.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031008172601/http://hjem.get2net.dk:80/JamesBond/www/artikler/steroidemisbrug/arnoldandsteroids.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 8, 2003 |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |last=Theunissen |first=Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Schwarzenegger sued Dr. Willi Heepe, a German doctor who publicly predicted his early death on the basis of a link between his steroid use and his [[#Accidents and injuries|later heart problems]]. As the doctor had never examined him personally, Schwarzenegger collected a US$10,000 libel judgment against him in a German court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Schwarzenegger Wins German Lawsuit |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P1-24150868.html |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |agency=United Press International |date=December 1, 1999 |accessdate=December 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Schwarzenegger also sued and settled with the ''[[Globe (tabloid)|Globe]]'', a U.S. tabloid which had made similar predictions about the bodybuilder's future health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arnie settles $50m libel case |publisher=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/574902.stm |date=December 22, 1999 |accessdate=December 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acting career==

===Early roles===
Schwarzenegger wanted to move from bodybuilding into acting, finally achieving it when he was chosen to play the role of Hercules in 1970's ''[[Hercules in New York]]''. Credited under the [[stage name]] &quot;Arnold Strong&quot;, his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] after production.&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot; /&gt; His second film appearance was as a [[deaf-mute]] mob hitman in ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film ''[[Stay Hungry (film)|Stay Hungry]]'' (1976), for which he was awarded a [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actor|Golden Globe for New Male Star of the Year]]. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career: &quot;It was very difficult for me in the beginning&amp;nbsp;– I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. You name it, and they told me I had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was told that I had no chance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;askarnold1&quot; /&gt;

Schwarzenegger drew attention and boosted his profile in the [[bodybuilding]] film ''[[Pumping Iron]]'' (1977),&lt;ref name=&quot;katzfilm&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot; /&gt; elements of which were dramatized; in 1991, he purchased the rights to the film, its outtakes, and associated still photography.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web |title=The Smoking Gun: Archive |publisher=TheSmokingGun |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/arnoldpump1.html |accessdate=May 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, he made guest appearances in single episodes of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[The San Pedro Beach Bums]]'' and the ABC [[police procedural]] ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]''. Schwarzenegger auditioned for the title role of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', but did not win the role because of his height. Later, [[Lou Ferrigno]] got the part of Dr. David Banner's alter ego. Schwarzenegger appeared with [[Kirk Douglas]] and [[Ann-Margret]] in the 1979 comedy ''[[The Villain (1979 film)|The Villain]]''. In 1980, he starred in a biographical film of the 1950s actress [[Jayne Mansfield]] as Mansfield's husband, [[Mickey Hargitay]].

===Action superstar===
Schwarzenegger's breakthrough film was the [[sword-and-sorcery]] epic ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' in 1982, which was a box-office hit.&lt;ref name=&quot;katzfilm&quot; /&gt; This was followed by a sequel, ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'', in 1984, although it was not as successful as its predecessor.&lt;ref name=&quot;tessay&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Clark |last=Collis |title=EMPIRE ESSAY: The Terminator |url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=132648 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235924/http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=132648 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |work=Empire |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, Schwarzenegger starred in the promotional video, ''[[Rio Carnival|Carnival]] in Rio''. In 1984, he made his first appearance as the eponymous character, and what some would say was his acting career's signature role, in [[James Cameron]]'s science fiction [[thriller film]] ''[[The Terminator]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;katzfilm&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fanleam&quot; /&gt; Following this, Schwarzenegger made ''[[Red Sonja (film)|Red Sonja]]'' in 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;tessay&quot; /&gt;

During the 1980s, audiences had an appetite for action films, with both Schwarzenegger and [[Sylvester Stallone]] becoming international stars.&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot; /&gt; Schwarzenegger's roles reflected his sense of humor, separating him from more serious action hero films. He made a number of successful action films in the '80s, such as ''[[Commando (1985 film)|Commando]]'' (1985), ''[[Raw Deal (1986 film)|Raw Deal]]'' (1986), ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]'' (1987), ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' (1987), and ''[[Red Heat]]'' (1988).

[[File:Chth arnold schwarzenegger.jpg|left|thumb|Footprints and handprints of Arnold Schwarzenegger in front of the [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], with his famous catchphrase ''&quot;[[I'll be back]]&quot;'' written in.]]
''[[Twins (1988 film)|Twins]]'' (1988), a comedy with [[Danny DeVito]], also proved successful. ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990) netted Schwarzenegger $10&amp;nbsp;million and 15% of the film's gross. A science fiction script, the film was based on the [[Philip K. Dick]] short story &quot;[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]&quot;. ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]'' (1990) reunited him with director [[Ivan Reitman]], who directed him in ''Twins''. Schwarzenegger had a brief foray into directing, first with a 1990 episode of the TV series ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', entitled &quot;[[List of Tales from the Crypt episodes#Season 2 (1990)|The Switch]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jerry |last=Buck |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger directs |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19900422&amp;id=xdIpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ms4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5765,1660751 |newspaper=Spartanburg Herald-Journal |publisher=Google News Archive |agency=Associated Press |date=April 22, 1990 |accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then with the 1992 [[telemovie]] ''[[Christmas in Connecticut]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Endrst |title='Connecticut' could use more of Arnold's muscle |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19920412&amp;id=m1ZWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oesDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6719,2774672 |newspaper=The Register-Guard |publisher=Google News Archive |date=April 12, 1992 |accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has not directed since.

Schwarzenegger's commercial peak was his return as the title character in 1991's ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'', which was the highest-grossing film of 1991. In 1993, the [[National Association of Theatre Owners]] named him the &quot;International Star of the Decade&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot; /&gt; His next film project, the 1993 self-aware [[action comedy]] [[parody|spoof]] ''Last Action Hero'', was released opposite ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', and did not do well at the box office. His next film, the comedy drama ''[[True Lies]]'' (1994), was a popular spy film, and saw Schwarzenegger reunited with James Cameron.

That same year, the comedy ''[[Junior (1994 film)|Junior]]'' was released, the last of Schwarzenegger's three collaborations with Ivan Reitman and again co-starring Danny DeVito. This film brought him his second Golden Globe nomination, this time for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor&amp;nbsp;– Musical or Comedy]]. It was followed by the action thriller ''[[Eraser (film)|Eraser]]'' (1996), the Christmas comedy ''[[Jingle All The Way]]'' (1996), and the comic book-based ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]'' (1997), in which he played the villain [[Mr. Freeze]]. This was his final film before taking time to recuperate from a back injury. Following the critical failure of ''Batman &amp; Robin'', his film career and box office prominence went into decline. He returned with the supernatural thriller ''[[End of Days (film)|End of Days]]'' (1999), later followed by the action films ''[[The 6th Day]]'' (2000) and ''[[Collateral Damage (film)|Collateral Damage]]'' (2002), both of which failed to do well at the box office. In 2003, he made his third appearance as the title character in ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'', which went on to earn over $150&amp;nbsp;million domestically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=terminator3.htm |title=Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=December 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In tribute to Schwarzenegger in 2002, Forum Stadtpark, a local cultural association, proposed plans to build a 25-meter (82&amp;nbsp;ft) tall ''Terminator'' statue in a park in central [[Graz]]. Schwarzenegger reportedly said he was flattered, but thought the money would be better spent on social projects and the [[Special Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arnold wants 'Terminator' statue killed |publisher=Killoggs |url=http://www.killoggs.com/news/?news=609 |date=September 27, 2002 |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement===
His film appearances after becoming Governor of California included a three-second cameo appearance in ''[[The Rundown]]'', and the 2004 remake of ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (2004 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]''. In 2005, he appeared as himself in the film ''[[The Kid &amp; I]]''. He voiced [[Baron von Steuben]] in the ''[[Liberty's Kids]]'' episode &quot;[[Valley Forge]]&quot;.

===''The Celebrity Apprentice''===
In September 2015, it was announced Schwarzenegger would replace [[Donald Trump]] as host of ''[[The New Celebrity Apprentice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/09/14/media/arnold-schwarzenegger-apprentice-nbc/ |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger is the next host of NBC's 'Celebrity Apprentice' |author=Brian Stelter and Frank Pallotta |date=September 14, 2015 |work=CNNMoney}}&lt;/ref&gt; This show, the 15th season of ''The Apprentice'', aired during the 2016–2017 TV season. In the show, he used the phrases &quot;you're terminated&quot; and &quot;get to the choppa&quot;, which are quotes from some of his famous roles, when firing the contestants.

In March 2017, following repeated criticisms from [[Donald Trump]], Schwarzenegger announced that he would not return for another season on the show. Schwarzenegger reacted to Trump’s latest remarks on January 2017: “Hey, Donald, I have a great idea. Why don’t we switch jobs?” he asked in an Instagram clip. “You take over TV because you’re such an expert in ratings, and I take over your job, and then people can finally sleep comfortably again.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2017/03/03/arnold-quits-apprentice-before-he-can-fired/98700892/ |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger leaves 'Apprentice,' Trump says he was fired |publisher= |accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
{{Main article|Political career of Arnold Schwarzenegger}}

===Early politics===
[[File:Arnold-Cheney.jpg|thumb|Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] meets with Schwarzenegger for the first time at the [[White House]]]]

Schwarzenegger has been a registered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] for many years. As an actor, his political views were always well known as they contrasted with those of many other prominent Hollywood stars, who are generally considered to be a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-leaning community. At the [[2004 Republican National Convention]], Schwarzenegger gave a speech and explained he was a Republican because the Democrats of the 1960s sounded too much like Austrian socialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/31/gop.schwarzenegger.transcript/ |date=August 31, 2004 |title=Schwarzenegger: No country more welcoming than the USA |publisher=CNN |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408110102/http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/31/gop.schwarzenegger.transcript/ |archivedate=April 8, 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I finally arrived here in 1968. What a special day it was. I remember I arrived here with empty pockets but full of dreams, full of determination, full of desire. The [[United States presidential election, 1968|presidential campaign]] was in full swing. I remember watching the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]–[[Hubert Humphrey|Humphrey]] presidential race on TV. A friend of mine who spoke German and English translated for me. I heard Humphrey saying things that sounded like socialism, which I had just left.

But then I heard Nixon speak. He was talking about free enterprise, getting the government off your back, lowering the taxes and strengthening the military. Listening to Nixon speak sounded more like a breath of fresh air. I said to my friend, I said, &quot;What party is he?&quot; My friend said, &quot;He's a Republican.&quot; I said, &quot;Then I am a Republican.&quot; And I have been a Republican ever since.}}

[[File:Arnold Schwarzenegger on Capitol Hill.jpg|thumb|Arnold Schwarzenegger on Capitol Hill for an event related to the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports]]
In 1985, Schwarzenegger appeared in &quot;[[Stop the Madness]]&quot;, an anti-drug music video sponsored by the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]]. He first came to wide public notice as a Republican during the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]], accompanying then-Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]] at a campaign rally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Noonan&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Noonan |first=Peggy |authorlink=Peggy Noonan |title=What I Saw at the Revolution: A Political Life in the Reagan Era |publisher=Random House |date=October 14, 2003 |location=New York |page=384 |isbn=978-0-8129-6989-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger's first political appointment was as chairman of the [[President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports]], on which he served from 1990 to 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot; /&gt; He was nominated by [[George H. W. Bush]], who dubbed him &quot;[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Republican&quot;. He later served as chairman for the California Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports under Governor [[Pete Wilson]].

Between 1993 and 1994, Schwarzenegger was a [[Red Cross]] ambassador (a ceremonial role fulfilled by celebrities), recording several television/radio [[public service announcement]]s to donate blood.

In an interview with ''[[Talk (magazine)|Talk]]'' magazine in late 1999, Schwarzenegger was asked if he thought of running for office. He replied, &quot;I think about it many times. The possibility is there, because I feel it inside.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;governtalk&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Arnold cast as Governor? |date=October 4, 1999 |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/news.asp?id=90 |publisher=Schwarzenegger.com |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523203946/http://www.schwarzenegger.com/news.asp%3Fid%3D90 |archivedate=May 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' claimed shortly after that Schwarzenegger sought to end speculation that he might run for [[governor of California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;governtalk&quot; /&gt; Following his initial comments, Schwarzenegger said, &quot;I'm in show business&amp;nbsp;– I am in the middle of my career. Why would I go away from that and jump into something else?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;governtalk&quot; /&gt;

===Governor of California===
Schwarzenegger announced his candidacy in the [[California recall election, 2003|2003 California recall election]] for Governor of California on August 6, 2003, episode of ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;profilear&quot; /&gt; Schwarzenegger had the most name recognition in a crowded field of candidates, but he had never held public office and his political views were unknown to most Californians. His candidacy immediately became national and international news, with media outlets dubbing him the &quot;Governator&quot; (referring to ''The Terminator'' movies, see above) and &quot;[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]&quot; (the name of another one of his films), and calling the recall election &quot;[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]&quot; (yet another movie starring Schwarzenegger). Schwarzenegger declined to participate in several debates with other recall replacement candidates, and appeared in only one debate on September 24, 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;FirstDebate&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Grey |first=Barry |title=First debate in California recall election: Snapshot of a political system in crisis |date=November 6, 2003 |url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2003/sep2003/cali-s06.shtml |publisher=wsws.org |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508191758/http://www.wsws.org/articles/2003/sep2003/cali-s06.shtml |archivedate=May 8, 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schwarzenegger Bush.jpg|thumb|200px|left|President [[George W. Bush]] meets with Schwarzenegger after his successful election to the California Governorship.]]
On October 7, 2003, the recall election resulted in Governor [[Gray Davis]] being removed from office with 55.4% of the ''Yes'' vote in favor of a recall. Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California under the second question on the ballot with 48.6% of the vote to choose a successor to Davis. Schwarzenegger defeated Democrat [[Cruz Bustamante]], fellow Republican [[Tom McClintock]], and others. His nearest rival, Bustamante, received 31% of the vote. In total, Schwarzenegger won the election by about 1.3&amp;nbsp;million votes. Under the regulations of the [[California Constitution]], no runoff election was required. Schwarzenegger was the second foreign-born governor of California after Irish-born Governor [[John G. Downey]] in 1862.

Schwarzenegger was entrenched in what he considered to be his mandate in cleaning up [[gridlock]]. Building on a catchphrase from the sketch &quot;[[Hans and Franz]]&quot; from ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (which partly parodied his bodybuilding career), Schwarzenegger called the Democratic State politicians &quot;[[girlie men]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFGirlieMen&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Schwarzenegger deems opponents 'girlie-men' |date=July 18, 2004 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/07/18/MNGH57NKAF1.DTL |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |first=Peter |last=Nicholas |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504060359/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/07/18/MNGH57NKAF1.DTL |archivedate=May 4, 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger's early victories included repealing an unpopular increase in the vehicle registration fee as well as preventing driver's licenses being given out to illegal immigrants, but later he began to feel the backlash when powerful state unions began to oppose his various initiatives. Key among his reckoning with political realities was a [[California special election, 2005|special election]] he called in November 2005, in which four ballot measures he sponsored were defeated. Schwarzenegger accepted personal responsibility for the defeats and vowed to continue to seek consensus for the people of California. He would later comment that &quot;no one could win if the opposition raised 160&amp;nbsp;million dollars to defeat you&quot;.  The U.S. Supreme Court later found the public employee unions' use of compulsory fundraising during the campaign had been illegal in ''[[Knox v. Service Employees International Union, Local 1000]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/06/opinion-analysis-knox-knocks-unions-on-mid-year-assessment-for-non-members/ |title=Opinion analysis:  Knox knocks unions on mid-year assessment for non-members |work=SCOTUSblog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger then went against the advice of fellow Republican strategists and appointed a Democrat, Susan Kennedy, as his Chief of Staff. Schwarzenegger gradually moved towards a more politically moderate position, determined to build a winning legacy with only a short time to go until the next gubernatorial election.

Schwarzenegger ran for re-election against Democrat [[Phil Angelides]], the [[California State Treasurer]], in the [[California gubernatorial election, 2006|2006 elections]], held on November 7, 2006. Despite a poor year nationally for the Republican party, Schwarzenegger won re-election with 56.0% of the vote compared with 38.9% for Angelides, a margin of well over one million votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=General Election&amp;nbsp;– Governor |publisher=California Secretary of State |url=http://vote.ss.ca.gov/Returns/gov/00.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219111658/http://vote.ss.ca.gov/Returns/gov/00.htm |archivedate=February 19, 2007 |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, many commentators have seen Schwarzenegger as moving away from the right and towards the center of the political spectrum. After hearing a speech by Schwarzenegger at the 2006 [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] breakfast, San Francisco mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] said that, &quot;[H]e's becoming a Democrat [… H]e's running back, not even to the center.

It was rumored that Schwarzenegger might run for the [[United States Senate]] in 2010, as his governorship would be term-limited by that time.

Wendy Leigh, who wrote an unofficial biography on Schwarzenegger, claims he plotted his political rise from an early age using the movie business and [[bodybuilding]] as building blocks to escape a depressing home.&lt;ref name=&quot;governG2&quot; /&gt; Leigh portrays Schwarzenegger as obsessed with power and quotes him as saying, &quot;I wanted to be part of the small percentage of people who were leaders, not the large mass of followers.

Schwarzenegger's endorsement in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2008|Republican primary]] of the [[2008 U.S. presidential election]] was highly sought; despite being good friends with candidates [[Rudy Giuliani]] and Senator [[John McCain]], Schwarzenegger remained neutral throughout 2007 and early 2008. Giuliani dropped out of the presidential race on January 30, 2008, largely because of a poor showing in Florida, and endorsed McCain. Later that night, Schwarzenegger was in the audience at a Republican debate at the [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Library]] in California. The following day, he endorsed McCain, joking, &quot;It's Rudy's fault!&quot; (in reference to his friendships with both candidates and that he could not make up his mind). Schwarzenegger's endorsement was thought to be a boost for Senator McCain's campaign; both spoke about their concerns for the environment and economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=The Baltimore Sun |url=http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/news/politics/blog/2008/01/arnold_opens_flood_of_mccain_e.html |title=Arnold opens 'flood' of McCain endorsements |accessdate=May 7, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307072727/http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com:80/news/politics/blog/2008/01/arnold_opens_flood_of_mccain_e.html |archivedate=March 7, 2008 |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor Schwarzenegger played a significant role in opposing [[California Proposition 66 (2004)|Proposition 66]], a proposed amendment of the Californian [[Three Strikes Law]], in November 2004. This amendment would have required the third felony to be either violent or serious to mandate a 25-years-to-life sentence.

They learned about it in a call from a reporter.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

The Santos family, along with the San Diego district attorney, sued to stop the commutation, claiming that it violated [[Marsy's Law]]. In September 2012, Sacramento County superior court judge Lloyd Connelly stated, &quot;Based on the evidentiary records before this court involving this case, there was an abuse of discretion...This was a distasteful commutation.

===Allegations of sexual misconduct===
[[File:Arnold Schwarzenegger sexual harassment protestors750.jpg|thumb|[[Code Pink]] protesting against Schwarzenegger]]
During his initial campaign for governor, allegations of sexual and personal misconduct were raised against Schwarzenegger, dubbed &quot;Gropegate&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;grope1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Sex scandal draws Arnie apology |date=March 10, 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3159122.stm |publisher=BBC |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218154557/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3159122.stm |archivedate=December 18, 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the last five days before the election, news reports appeared in the ''Los Angeles Times'' recounting allegations of sexual misconduct from several individual women, six of whom eventually came forward with their personal stories.&lt;ref name=&quot;behaving badly&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Schwarzenegger sorry for behaving 'badly' toward women |publisher=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/10/02/recall.schwarzenegger/index.html |date=October 3, 2003 |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408110108/http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/10/02/recall.schwarzenegger/index.html |archivedate=April 8, 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the women claimed he had grabbed their breasts, a fourth said he placed his hand under her skirt on her buttock. A fifth woman claimed Schwarzenegger tried to take off her bathing suit in a hotel elevator, and the last said he pulled her onto his lap and asked her about a sex act.&lt;ref name=&quot;grope1&quot; /&gt;

Schwarzenegger admitted that he has &quot;behaved badly sometimes&quot; and apologized, but also stated that &quot;a lot of [what] you see in the stories is not true&quot;. This came after an interview in adult magazine ''[[Oui (magazine)|Oui]]'' from 1977 surfaced, in which Schwarzenegger discussed attending sexual orgies and using substances such as [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Schwarzenegger's Sex Talk |publisher=The Smoking Gun |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/schwarzeneggers-sex-talk |accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger is shown smoking a marijuana joint after winning Mr. Olympia in the 1975 documentary film ''[[Pumping Iron]].'' In an interview with ''[[GQ]]'' magazine in October 2007, Schwarzenegger said, &quot;[Marijuana] is not a drug. It's a leaf. My drug was pumping iron, trust me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannabis&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/29/local/me-arnold29 |title=Governor says marijuana is not a drug, 'it's a leaf' |date=October 29, 2007 |work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; His spokesperson later said the comment was meant to be a joke.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannabis&quot; /&gt;

British television personality [[Anna Richardson]] settled a libel lawsuit in August 2006 against Schwarzenegger, his top aide, Sean Walsh, and his publicist, Sheryl Main.&lt;ref name=&quot;AR&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Schwarzenegger libel 'settled' |date=August 26, 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/5288194.stm |publisher=BBC |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909074501/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/5288194.stm |archivedate=September 9, 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A joint statement read: &quot;The parties are content to put this matter behind them and are pleased that this legal dispute has now been settled.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AR&quot; /&gt; Richardson claimed they tried to tarnish her reputation by dismissing her allegations that Schwarzenegger touched her breast during a press event for ''[[The 6th Day]]'' in London.&lt;ref name=&quot;AR2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=UK judge allows Arnie libel case |date=March 23, 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/4375679.stm |publisher=BBC |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821025435/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/4375679.stm |archivedate=August 21, 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed Walsh and Main libeled her in a ''Los Angeles Times'' article when they contended she encouraged his behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;AR&quot; /&gt;

===Citizenship===
[[File:Arnold Schwarzenegger 2004-01-30.jpg|thumb|right|Schwarzenegger in 2004]]

Schwarzenegger became a [[naturalized U.S. citizen]] on September 17, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=[[United Press International]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/17/us/actor-becomes-us-citizen.html |title=Actor Becomes U.S. Citizen |work=The New York Times |date=September 17, 1983 |accessdate=January 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before he gained his citizenship, he asked the Austrian authorities for the right to keep his [[Austrian citizenship]], as Austria does not usually allow [[dual citizenship]]. His request was granted, and he retained his Austrian citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Leamer, p. 199-200&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Peter Pilz]], a member of the [[Austrian Parliament]] from the [[Austrian Green Party]], unsuccessfully advocated for Parliament to revoke Schwarzenegger's Austrian citizenship due to his decision not to prevent the executions of [[Donald Beardslee]] and [[Stanley Williams]]. Pilz argued that Schwarzenegger caused damage to Austria's reputation in the international community, because Austria abolished the death penalty in 1968. Pilz based his argument on Article 33 of the Austrian Citizenship Act, which states: &quot;A citizen, who is in the public service of a foreign country, shall be deprived of his citizenship, if he heavily damages the reputation or the interests of the Austrian Republic.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DamageAustria&quot; /&gt; Pilz claimed that Schwarzenegger's actions in support of the death penalty (prohibited in Austria under Protocol 13 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]) had damaged Austria's reputation. Schwarzenegger explained his actions by pointing out that his only duty as Governor of California with respect to the death penalty was to correct an error by the justice system by pardon or clemency, if such an error had occurred.

===Environmental record===
On September 27, 2006, Schwarzenegger signed the [[Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006]], creating the nation's first cap on [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. The law set new regulations on the amount of emissions utilities, refineries and manufacturing plants are allowed to release into the atmosphere. Schwarzenegger also signed a second global warming bill that prohibits large utilities and corporations in California from making long-term contracts with suppliers who do not meet the state's greenhouse gas emission standards. The two bills are part of a plan to reduce California's emissions by 25 percent to 1990s levels by 2020. In 2005, Schwarzenegger issued an executive order calling to reduce greenhouse gases to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/27/AR2006092700174.html |accessdate=May 15, 2008 |work=The Washington Post |title=Schwarzenegger Signs Global Warming Bill |first=Samantha |last=Young |date=September 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger signed another executive order on October 17, 2006, allowing California to work with the Northeast's [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]]. They plan to reduce [[carbon dioxide]] emissions by issuing a limited amount of carbon credits to each power plant in participating states. Any power plants that exceed emissions for the amount of carbon credits will have to purchase more credits to cover the difference. The plan took effect in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Oct17/0,4670,GlobalWarmingSchwarzenegger,00.html |accessdate=May 15, 2008 |publisher=Fox News Channel |title=Cal Joins Northeast Global Warming Fight |first=Karen |last=Matthews |date=October 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to using his political power to fight global warming, the governor has taken steps at his home to reduce his personal carbon footprint. Schwarzenegger has adapted one of his [[Hummer H1|Hummers]] to run on hydrogen and another to run on biofuels. He has also installed solar panels to heat his home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/04/02/8403410/index.htm &quot;The Governator's green agenda&quot;] ''Fortune''.

In respect of his contribution to the direction of the US motor industry, Schwarzenegger was invited to open the 2009 [[Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE]] World Congress in Detroit, on April 20, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sae.org/servlets/pressRoom?OBJECT_TYPE=PressReleases&amp;PAGE=showRelease&amp;RELEASE_ID=970 &quot;SAE 2009 World Congress Special Opening Ceremonies to Feature Gov.

===Presidential ambitions===
The [[Equal Opportunity to Govern Amendment]] in 2003 was widely accredited as the &quot;Amend for Arnold&quot; bill, which would have removed language from the U.S. Constitution prohibiting his run, having been born in Austria. In 2004, the &quot;Amend for Arnold&quot; campaign was launched, featuring a website and TV advertising promotion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Amend-for-Arnold-campaign-launched-Web-site-2635267.php &quot;'Amend for Arnold' campaign launched / Web site, TV spot promote change to Constitution&quot;], John Wildermuth.

In October 2013, the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that Schwarzenegger was exploring a future run for [[President of the United States|president]]. The former California governor would face a [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] hurdle; [[Natural-born-citizen clause|Article II, Section I, Clause V]] nominally prevents individuals who are not natural-born citizens of the United States from assuming the office. He has reportedly been lobbying legislators about a possible [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|constitutional change]], or filing a legal challenge to the provision.

==Business career==
Schwarzenegger has had a highly successful business career.&lt;ref name=&quot;governG2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LAWarn&quot; /&gt; Following his move to the United States, Schwarzenegger became a &quot;prolific goal setter&quot; and would write his objectives at the start of the year on index cards, like starting a mail order business or buying a new car&amp;nbsp;– and succeed in doing so.&lt;ref name=&quot;DT2&quot; /&gt; By the age of 30, Schwarzenegger was a millionaire, well before his career in Hollywood. His financial independence came from his success as a budding entrepreneur with a series of successful business ventures and investments.

===Bricklaying business===
In 1968, Schwarzenegger and fellow bodybuilder [[Franco Columbu]] started a bricklaying business. The business flourished thanks to the pair's marketing savvy and an increased demand following the [[1971 San Fernando earthquake]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Millionaire Magazine&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Real Life Action Hero |work=Millionaire Magazine |url=http://www.millionaire.com/interviews_schwarzenegger.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041212192915/http://www.millionaire.com:80/interviews_schwarzenegger.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 12, 2004 |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |last=Morgan |first=Kaya}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=&quot;Working&quot; Out |publisher=Schwarzenegger.com |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/life/didyouknow/life_didyouknow_eng_legacy_257.asp?sec=life&amp;subsec=didyouknow |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523204758/http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/life/didyouknow/life_didyouknow_eng_legacy_257.asp%3Fsec%3Dlife%26subsec%3Ddidyouknow |archivedate=May 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger and Columbu used profits from their bricklaying venture to start a mail order business, selling bodybuilding and fitness-related equipment and instructional tapes.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeline&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Millionaire Magazine&quot; /&gt;

===Investments===
Schwarzenegger rolled profits from the mail order business and his bodybuilding competition winnings into his first real estate investment venture: an apartment building he purchased for $10,000. He would later go on to invest in a number of real estate holding companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Schwarzenegger reveals pumped-up finances |work=San Francisco Chronicle |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2003/08/10/ARNOLD.TMP |date=August 10, 2003 |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |last=Williams |first=Lance |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318192048/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2003/08/10/ARNOLD.TMP |archivedate=March 18, 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Best Salesman in America? |publisher=Selling Power |url=http://www.sellingpower.com/article/display.asp?aid=SP4182687 |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |last=Fleschner |first=Malcolm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224112746/http://www.sellingpower.com/article/display.asp?aid=SP4182687 |archivedate=February 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger was a founding celebrity investor in the [[Planet Hollywood]] chain of international theme restaurants (modeled after the [[Hard Rock Cafe]]) along with [[Bruce Willis]], [[Sylvester Stallone]] and [[Demi Moore]]. Schwarzenegger severed his financial ties with the business in early 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;planetbbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/619317.stm |title=Arnie's Planet Hollywood split |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=January 26, 2000 |accessdate=April 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jan/26/business/fi-57832 |title=It's Hasta la Vista, Planet Hollywood |first=Paul |last=Lieberman |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 26, 2000 |accessdate=April 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger said the company had not had the success he had hoped for, claiming he wanted to focus his attention on &quot;new US global business ventures&quot; and his movie career.&lt;ref name=&quot;planetbbc&quot; /&gt;

He also invested in a shopping mall in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. He has talked about some of those who have helped him over the years in business: &quot;I couldn't have learned about business without a parade of teachers guiding me... from [[Milton Friedman]] to [[Donald Trump]]... and now, [[Les Wexner]] and [[Warren Buffett]].

It is a festival that hosts thousands of international health and fitness professionals which has also expanded into a three-day expo. He also owns a movie production company called Oak Productions, Inc. and Fitness Publications, a joint publishing venture with [[Simon &amp; Schuster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/7-self-made-immigrant-millionaires.html?pt=BureoF4GVB?date=10410705&amp;page=3 |title=7 self-made immigrant millionaires |publisher=Yahoo Canada |date=November 9, 2012 |accessdate=November 17, 2012 |author=Andrea N.

===Restaurant===
In 1992, Schwarzenegger and his wife opened a restaurant in [[Santa Monica]] called ''Schatzi On Main''. ''Schatzi'' literally means &quot;little treasure,&quot; colloquial for &quot;honey&quot; or &quot;darling&quot; in German. In 1998, he sold his restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights is in the wrong in its junk fax lawsuit where it falsely blames Arnold Schwarzenegger for faxes sent to promote a restaurant he doesn't own |publisher=Schwarzenegger.com |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/news/uptotheminute/news_uptotheminute_eng_legacy_16.asp?sec=news&amp;subsec=uptotheminute |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523204836/http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/news/uptotheminute/news_uptotheminute_eng_legacy_16.asp%3Fsec%3Dnews%26subsec%3Duptotheminute |archivedate=May 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wealth===
{{See also|List of richest American politicians}}
Schwarzenegger's net worth had been conservatively estimated at $100–$200&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;100million&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Lance |title=Schwarzenegger worth $100&amp;nbsp;million, experts say |date=August 17, 2003 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2003/08/17/TAXES.TMP |work=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328121715/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2003/08/17/TAXES.TMP |archivedate=March 28, 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; After separating from his wife, [[Maria Shriver]], in 2011, it has been estimated that his net worth has been approximately $400 million, and even as high as $800 million, based on tax returns he filed in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://extratv.warnerbros.com/2011/05/arnold_and_marias_surprise_split_how_much_is_at_stake_in_divorce.php |title=Arnold and Maria's Surprise Split: How Much is at Stake in Divorce? |publisher=Extratv.warnerbros.com |date=May 10, 2011 |accessdate=October 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years as an investor, he invested his bodybuilding and movie earnings in an array of stocks, bonds, privately controlled companies, and real estate holdings worldwide, making his net worth as an accurate estimation difficult to calculate, particularly in light of declining real estate values owing to [[2007 financial crisis|economic recessions]] in the U.S. and [[Eurozone crisis|Europe]] since the late 2000s. In June 1997, Schwarzenegger spent $38&amp;nbsp;million of his own money on a private Gulfstream jet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fleming |first=Charles |title=[[High concept: Don Simpson and the Hollywood Culture of Excess]] |publisher=Bloomsbury |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-7475-4262-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger once said of his fortune, &quot;Money doesn't make you happy.

==Personal life==

===Early relationships===
In 1969, Schwarzenegger met Barbara Outland (later Barbara Outland Baker), an English teacher he lived with until 1974.&lt;ref name=&quot;arniememoir&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Arnie's ex-girlfriend pens memoir |date=September 9, 2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/3092740.stm |publisher=BBC |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422031941/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/3092740.stm |archivedate=April 22, 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger talked about Barbara in his [[memoir]] in 1977: &quot;Basically it came down to this: she was a well-balanced woman who wanted an ordinary, solid life, and I was not a well-balanced man, and hated the very idea of ordinary life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;arniememoir&quot; /&gt; Baker has described Schwarzenegger as &quot;[a] joyful personality, totally charismatic, adventurous, and athletic&quot; but claims towards the end of the relationship he became &quot;insufferable&amp;nbsp;– classically conceited&amp;nbsp;– the world revolved around him&quot;.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite news |title=Actor's old flame says he's a great guy |date=September 15, 2003 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/09/15/MN272943.DTL |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=April 19, 2007 |first=Lance |last=Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker published her memoir in 2006, entitled ''Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak''.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakes&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Catherine |last=Elsworth |title=Arnie puts his weight behind ex-lover's tell-all memoir |date=September 14, 2006 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1528857/Arnie-puts-his-weight-behind-ex-lover%27s-tell-all-memoir.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Baker, at times, painted an unflattering portrait of her former lover, Schwarzenegger actually contributed to the tell-all book with a foreword, and also met with Baker for three hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakes&quot; /&gt; Baker claims, for example, that she only learned of his being unfaithful after they split, and talks of a turbulent and passionate love life.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakes&quot; /&gt; Schwarzenegger has made it clear that their respective recollection of events can differ.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakes&quot; /&gt; The couple first met six to eight months after his arrival in the U.S – their first date was watching the [[Apollo 11|first Apollo Moon landing]] on television.&lt;ref name=&quot;DT2&quot; /&gt; They shared an [[apartment]] in [[Santa Monica]] for three and a half years, and having little money, would visit the beach all day, or have barbecues in the back yard.&lt;ref name=&quot;DT2&quot; /&gt; Although Baker claims that when she first met him, he had &quot;little understanding of polite society&quot; and she found him a turn-off, she says, &quot;He's as much a self-made man as it's possible to be – he never got encouragement from his parents, his family, his brother. He just had this huge determination to prove himself, and that was very attractive … I'll go to my grave knowing Arnold loved me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DT2&quot; /&gt;

Schwarzenegger met his next paramour, Sue Moray, a [[Beverly Hills]] hairdresser's assistant, on [[Venice Beach]] in July 1977. According to Moray, the couple led an open relationship: &quot;We were faithful when we were both in LA … but when he was out of town, we were free to do whatever we wanted.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wl&quot; /&gt; Schwarzenegger met [[Maria Shriver]] at the Robert F. Kennedy Tennis Tournament in August 1977, and went on to have a relationship with both women until August 1978, when Moray (who knew of his relationship with Shriver) issued an ultimatum.&lt;ref name=&quot;wl&quot; /&gt;

===Accidents and injuries===
Schwarzenegger was born with a [[bicuspid aortic valve]], an aortic valve with only two leaflets (a normal aortic valve has three leaflets).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Surgery Leaves Star Undimmed |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/NEWS+LITE+:+SURGERY+LEAVES+STAR+UNDIMMED-a083864140 |work=The Free Library |publisher=Farlex |date=April 18, 1997 |accessdate=July 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Surgery&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Starnes |first=Dr. Vaughn A. |title=Renowned Cardiac Surgeon Proclaims Medical &quot;Facts&quot; In Article &quot;Represent No Facts At All&quot; |date=March 8, 2001 |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/news/uptotheminute/news_uptotheminute_eng_legacy_18.asp?sec=news&amp;subsec=uptotheminute |accessdate=March 3, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523203941/http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/news/uptotheminute/news_uptotheminute_eng_legacy_18.asp%3Fsec%3Dnews%26subsec%3Duptotheminute |archivedate=May 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger opted in 1997 for a replacement heart valve made of his own transplanted tissue; medical experts predicted he would require heart valve replacement surgery in the following two to eight years as his valve would progressively degrade.

On January 8, 2006, while Schwarzenegger was riding his [[Harley Davidson]] motorcycle in Los Angeles, with his son Patrick in the sidecar, another driver backed into the street he was riding on, causing him and his son to collide with the car at a low speed. While his son and the other driver were unharmed, Schwarzenegger sustained a minor injury to his lip, requiring 15 stitches. &quot;No citations were issued&quot;, said Officer Jason Lee, a [[Los Angeles Police Department]] spokesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10811025/ |title=No Charges Against Schwarzenegger |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=July 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger did not obtain his motorcycle license until July 3, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Navarro |first=Mireya |title=Schwarzenegger Finally Gets a License |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/07/us/07arnold.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin |accessdate=February 2, 2011 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Height===
Schwarzenegger's official height of 6'2&quot; (1.88&amp;nbsp;m) has been brought into question by several articles. In his bodybuilding days in the late 1960s, he was measured to be 6'1.5&quot; (1.87&amp;nbsp;m), a height confirmed by his fellow bodybuilders.&lt;ref name=&quot;HeightArnold&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger Height, Schwarzenegger's |publisher=celebheights.com |url=http://www.celebheights.com/s/Arnold-Schwarzenegger-177.html |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwarzenegger Measured&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Schwarzenegger Measured |publisher=ArnoldHeight |url=http://www.arnoldheight.com/article5.html |accessdate=October 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007204058/http://www.arnoldheight.com:80/article5.html |archivedate=October 7, 2011 |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1988 both the ''Daily Mail'' and ''Time Out'' magazine mentioned that Schwarzenegger appeared noticeably shorter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrews, N page 157&quot;&gt;Andrews, N: &quot;True Myths: The life and times of Arnold Schwarzenegger,&quot; page 157.

===Autobiography===
Schwarzenegger's autobiography, ''Total Recall'', was released in October 2012. He devotes one chapter called &quot;The Secret&quot; to his extramarital affair. The majority of his book is about his successes in the three major chapters in his life: bodybuilder, actor, and Governor of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/national_world&amp;id=8829291 |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger talks scandal, new book with '60 Minutes' |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=September 28, 2012 |accessdate=January 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vehicles===
Schwarzenegger was the first civilian to purchase a [[Humvee]]. He was so enamored by the vehicle that he lobbied the Humvee's manufacturer, [[AM General]], to produce a [[street-legal vehicle|street-legal]], civilian version, which they did in 1992; the first two [[Hummer H1]]s they sold were also purchased by Schwarzenegger. In 2010, he had one regular and three running on non-fossil power sources; one for [[hydrogen]], one for [[vegetable oil]], and one for [[biodiesel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Hummer and Schwarzenegger: They probably won't be back |date=February 28, 2010 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/26/AR2010022603248.html |accessdate=October 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger was in the news in 2014 for buying a rare [[Bugatti Veyron]] Grand Sport Vitesse.

The Hummers that Schwarzenegger bought in 1992 are so large – each weighs {{convert|6300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and is {{convert|7|ft|m}} wide – that they are classified as large trucks, and U.S. fuel economy regulations do not apply to them. During the gubernatorial recall campaign he announced that he would convert one of his Hummers to burn hydrogen. The conversion was reported to have cost about US$21,000. After the election, he signed an executive order to jump-start the building of hydrogen refueling plants called the [[California Hydrogen Highway]] Network, and gained a [[U.S. Department of Energy]] grant to help pay for its projected US$91,000,000 cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thanks to Arnold, California to Pave the Hydrogen Highway |publisher=BMW World |url=http://www.usautoparts.net/bmw/hydrogen/schwarzenegger.htm |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316051803/http://www.usautoparts.net/bmw/hydrogen/schwarzenegger.htm |archivedate=March 16, 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; California took delivery of the first H2H (Hydrogen Hummer) in October 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HUMMER H2H Hydrogen Powered Experimental Vehicle |publisher=About.com |url=http://trucks.about.com/od/hybridcar/a/hummer_h2h.htm |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |last=Wickell |first=Dale}}&lt;/ref&gt;
