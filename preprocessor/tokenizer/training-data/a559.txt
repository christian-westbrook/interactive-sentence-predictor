The '''Apache Software Foundation''' {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|p|æ|tʃ|i:}} ('''ASF''') is an American [[non-profit corporation]] (classified as [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] in the United States) to support Apache software projects, including the [[Apache HTTP Server]]. The ASF was formed from the Apache Group and incorporated in [[Delaware corporation|Delaware]], U.S., in June 1999.&lt;ref name=incorporation&gt;

The Apache Software Foundation is a decentralized open source community of developers. The software they produce is distributed under the terms of the [[Apache License]] and is [[free and open-source software]] (FOSS). The Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus-based development process and an open and pragmatic software license. Each project is managed by a self-selected team of technical experts who are active contributors to the project. The ASF is a [[meritocracy]], implying that membership of the foundation is granted only to volunteers who have actively contributed to Apache projects. The ASF is considered a second generation&lt;ref&gt;[[François Letellier]], see 'Third Generation Open Source'&lt;/ref&gt; open-source organization, in that commercial support is provided without the risk of [[platform lock-in]].

Among the ASF's objectives are: to provide legal protection&lt;ref&gt;''See'' the [[Volunteer Protection Act]] article.&lt;/ref&gt; to volunteers working on Apache projects; to prevent the ''Apache'' brand name from being used by other organizations without permission.

The ASF also holds several ApacheCon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apachecon.com/ |title=apachecon.com |publisher=apachecon.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; conferences each year, highlighting Apache projects and related technology.

==History==
The history of the Apache Software Foundation is linked to the Apache HTTP Server, development beginning in February 1993. A group of eight developers started working on enhancing the [[NCSA HTTPd]] [[Daemon (computing)|daemon]]. They came to be known as the Apache Group. On March 25, 1999, the Apache Software Foundation was formed.&lt;ref name=incorporation/&gt; The first official meeting of the Apache Software Foundation was held on April 13, 1999, and by general consent that the initial membership list of the Apache Software Foundation, would be: [[Brian Behlendorf]], [[Ken Coar]], Miguel Gonzales, Mark Cox, [[Lars Eilebrecht]], Ralf S. Engelschall, [[Roy Fielding|Roy T. Fielding]], Dean Gaudet, Ben Hyde, [[Jim Jagielski]], Alexei Kosut, Martin Kraemer, [[Ben Laurie]], Doug MacEachern, Aram Mirzadeh, [[Sameer Parekh]], Cliff Skolnick, Marc Slemko, William (Bill) Stoddard, Paul Sutton, [[Randy Terbush]] and [[Dirk-Willem van Gulik]].&lt;ref name=firstMeeting&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate  = 2009-05-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a series of additional meetings to elect board members and resolve other legal matters regarding incorporation, the effective incorporation date of the Apache Software Foundation was set to June 1, 1999.&lt;ref name=effDate/&gt;

The [[Apache HTTP Server#Name|name 'Apache']] was chosen from respect for the Native American [[Apache]] Nation, well known for their superior skills in warfare strategy and their inexhaustible endurance. It also makes a pun on &quot;a patchy web server&quot;—a server made from a series of patches—but this was not its origin. The group of developers who released this new software soon started to call themselves the &quot;Apache Group&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==Projects==
{{See also|List of Apache Software Foundation projects}}
Apache divides its [[software development]] activities into separate semi-autonomous areas called &quot;top-level projects&quot; (formally known as a &quot;Project Management Committee&quot; in the bylaws&lt;ref name=bylaws&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;), some of which have a number of sub-projects. Unlike some other organizations that host [[Free and open-source software|FOSS]] projects, before a project is hosted at Apache it has to be licensed to the ASF with a grant or contributor agreement.&lt;ref name=licenses&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the ASF gains the necessary intellectual property rights for the development and distribution of all its projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= St. Amant|first=Kirk|author2=Brian Still|title=Handbook of research on open source software: technological, economic, and social perspectives|publisher=Idea Group Inc (IGI)|year=2007|pages=217–219|isbn=978-1-59140-999-1|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=75KT6GdcWbYC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=%22apache+foundation%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22apache%20foundation%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Board of directors==
The ASF board of directors has responsibility for overseeing the ASF's activities and acting as a central point of contact and communication for its projects. The board assigns corporate issues, assigning resources to projects, and manages corporate services, including funds and legal issues. It does not make technical decisions about individual projects; these are made by the individual Project Management Committees. The board is elected annually by members of the foundation and, after the March 2017 Annual Members Meeting, it consists of:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Financials==
In the 2010–11 fiscal year, the Foundation took in $539,410, almost entirely from grants and contributions with $12,349 from two ApacheCons.  With no employees and 2,663 volunteers, it spent $270,846 on infrastructure, $92,364 on public relations, and $17,891 on two ApacheCons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apache.org/foundation/records/990-2010.pdf|date=2011-09-14|title=Apache Software Foundation IRS Form 990 for 2010|accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
