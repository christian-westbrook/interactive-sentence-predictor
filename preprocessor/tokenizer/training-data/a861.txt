'''Ancus Marcius''' ({{circa|677}}–617 BC ;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Numa*.html Plutach's Parallel Lives vol. 1 p. 379]&lt;/ref&gt; reigned 642–617 BC)&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;&quot;Ancus Marcius&quot; in ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica|The New Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. Chicago: [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]], 15th edn., 1992, Vol. 1, p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt; was the [[Roman mythology|legendary]] fourth [[king of Rome]]. He was the son of Marcius (whose father, also named Marcius, had been a close friend of Numa Pompilius), who may be identified with [[Numa Marcius]],&lt;ref&gt;E. Peruzzi ''Le origini di Roma'' I. ''La famiglia'' Firenze 1970 p. 142 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and Pompilia (daughter of [[Numa Pompilius]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy1:32&quot;&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#32|1:32]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Festus (historian)|Festus]], Marcius had the surname of ''Ancus'' from his ''crooked'' arm. Upon the death of the previous king, [[Tullus Hostilius]], the [[Roman Senate]] appointed an [[interrex]], who in turn called a session of the [[Roman assemblies|assembly of the people]] who elected the new king.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy1:32&quot;/&gt;

Ancus Marcius was believed by the Romans to have been the namesake of the [[Marcia (gens)|Marcii]], a Plebeian family.&lt;ref&gt;Niebuhr, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PaEUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA301#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The History of Rome, Volume 1]'', p. 301&lt;/ref&gt;

==First acts as King==
According to [[Livy]], his first act as king was to order the [[Pontifex Maximus]] to copy the text concerning the performance of public ceremonies of religion from the commentaries of Numa Pompilius to be displayed to the public, so that the rites of religion should no longer be neglected or improperly performed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy1:32&quot;/&gt;

==War==
He waged [[Latin League#First war with Rome|war]] successfully against the [[Latin League|Latins]], and a number of them were settled on the [[Aventine Hill]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy1:33&quot;&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#33|1:33]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Livy]] the war was commenced by the Latins who anticipated Ancus would follow the pious pursuit of peace adopted by his grandfather, [[Numa Pompilius]]. The Latins initially made an incursion on Roman lands. When a Roman embassy sought restitution for the damage, the Latins gave a contemptuous reply. Ancus accordingly declared war on the Latins. The declaration is notable since, according to Livy, it was the first time that the Romans had declared war by means of the rites of the [[fetial]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy1:32&quot;/&gt;

Ancus Marcius marched from Rome with a newly levied army and took the Latin town of [[Politorium]] (situated near the town of [[Lanuvium]]) by storm. Its residents were removed to settle on the [[Aventine Hill]] in Rome as new citizens, following the Roman traditions from wars with the [[Sabines]] and [[Alba Longa|Albans]]. When the other Latins subsequently occupied the empty town of Politorium, Ancus took the town again and demolished it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy1:33&quot;/&gt; The Latin villages of Tellenae and Ficana were also sacked and demolished.

The war then focused on the Latin town of [[Medullia]]. The town had a strong garrison and was well fortified. Several engagements took place outside the town and the Romans were eventually victorious. Ancus returned to Rome with much booty. More Latins were brought to Rome as citizens and were settled at the foot of the Aventine near the [[Palatine Hill]], by the temple of [[Murcia (mythology)|Murcia]].
Ancus Marcius incorporated the [[Janiculum]] into the city, fortifying it with a wall and connecting it with the city by a wooden bridge across the [[Tiber]],&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Ancus Marcius|volume=1|page=953}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Pons Sublicius]].
On the land side of the city he constructed the [[Fossa Quiritium]], a ditch fortification.  He also built Rome's first prison, the [[Mamertine Prison|Mamertine prison]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy1:33&quot;/&gt;

He extended Roman territory to the sea, founding the port of [[Ostia Antica (archaeological site)|Ostia]], establishing salt-works around the port,&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; and taking the Silva Maesia, an area of coastal forest north of the [[Tiber]], from the [[Veii|Veientes]].
He expanded the temple of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter Feretrius]] to reflect these territorial successes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy1:33&quot;/&gt;
According to a reconstruction of the [[Fasti Triumphales]], Ancus Marcius celebrated at least one triumph, over the [[Sabines]] and Veientes.

==Successor==
Ancus Marcius was succeeded by [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]] who would later be executed by the sons of Ancus Marcius.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Patrician Marcius Rex -family is descended from Ancus Marcius and remained prominent during the republic and empire.
