{{American and British English differences}}

'''American English''' ('''AmE''', '''AE''', '''AmEng''', '''USEng''', '''en-US'''&lt;ref&gt;&lt;code&gt;en-US&lt;/code&gt; is the [[language code]] for ''U.S. English'', as defined by [[ISO standard]]s (see [[ISO 639-1]] and [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]]) and [[Internet standard]]s (see [[IETF language tag]]).&lt;/ref&gt;), sometimes called '''United States English''' or '''U.S. English''',&lt;ref&gt;Plichta, Bartlomiej, and Dennis R. Preston (2005). &quot;The /ay/s Have It: The Perception of /ay/ as a North-South Stereotype in the United States English.&quot; ''Acta Linguistica Hafniensia'' 37.1: 107-130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zentella, A. C. (1982). Spanish and English in contact in the United States: The Puerto Rican experience. Word, 33(1-2), 41.&lt;/ref&gt; is the set of [[language variety|varieties]] of the [[English language]] native to the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crystal|first=David|authorlink=David Crystal|year=1997|title=English as a Global Language|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-53032-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English is the most widely spoken language in the United States and is the common language used by the federal government, considered the ''[[de facto]]'' language of the country because of its widespread use. English has been given official status by 32 of the 50 state governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.languagepolicy.net/archives/langleg.htm |title=Language Legislation in the U.S.A. |publisher=languagepolicy.net |date=1 February 2012 |author=Crawford, James |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.us-english.org/view/1034 |title=U.S. English Efforts Lead West Virginia to Become 32nd State to Recognize English as Official Language |publisher=us-english.org |deadurl=no |accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, while both Spanish and English have equivalent status in the local courts of [[Puerto Rico]], under federal law, English is the official language for any matters being referred to the [[United States district court]] for the territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/48/864 |title=48 U.S. Code § 864 - Appeals, certiorari, removal of causes, etc.; use of English language &amp;#124; LII / Legal Information Institute |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of English in the United States is a result of [[British colonization of the Americas]]. The first wave of English-speaking settlers arrived in [[North America]] during the 17th century, followed by further migrations in the 18th and 19th centuries. Since then, American English has developed into new dialects, in some cases under the influence of [[West African languages|West African]] and [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]], [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and other languages of successive waves of immigrants to the United States.

Any American or even [[Canadian English]] [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]] perceived as free of noticeably local, ethnic, or cultural markers is popularly called &quot;[[General American]]&quot;, described by [[sociolinguist]] [[William Labov]] as &quot;a fairly uniform broadcast standard in the mass media&quot;. Otherwise, however, historical and present linguistic evidence does not support the notion of there being a mainstream [[standard English]] of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William (2012). ''Dialect diversity in America: The politics of language change''. University of Virginia Press. pp. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mtd3a-56ysUC&amp;pg|title= A Handbook of Varieties of English|author-first=William A.|author-last=Kretzchmar|editor-first=Bernd|editor-last=Kortmann|editor2-first=Edgar W.|editor2-last=Schneider|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|location=Berlin/New York|year=2004|page=262|isbn= 9783110175325}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Labov, with the major exception of [[Southern American English]], regional accents throughout the country are not yielding to this broadcast standard.&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William (2010). ''[http://www.cogsci.msu.edu/DSS/2011-2012/Labov/POLC%20Chapters%201-3.pdf The Politics of Language Change: Dialect Divergence in America]''. The University of Virginia Press. Pre-publication draft. p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, the sound of American English continues to evolve, with some local accents disappearing, but several larger regional accents emerging.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/speak/ahead/|title=Do You Speak American: What Lies Ahead|accessdate=2007-08-15|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Regional vocabularies of American English|North American English regional phonology}}

While written American English is (in general) standardized across the country, there are several recognizable variations in the spoken language, both in pronunciation and in vernacular vocabulary. The regional sounds of present-day American English are reportedly engaged in a complex phenomenon of &quot;both convergence and divergence&quot;: some accents are homogenizing and [[accent levelling|levelling]], while others are diversifying and deviating further away from one another.&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William. 2012. Dialect diversity in America: the politics of language change. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[William Labov]] summarized the current state of regional American accents as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;Labov 2010&quot;&gt;Labov, William (2010). ''[http://www.cogsci.msu.edu/DSS/2011-2012/Labov/POLC%20Chapters%201-3.pdf The Politics of Language Change: Dialect Divergence in America]''. The University of Virginia Press. Pre-publication draft. p. 53-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some regional American English has undergone &quot;vigorous new sound changes&quot; since the mid-nineteenth century onwards, spawning relatively recent [[Mid-Atlantic American English|Mid-Atlantic]] (centered on [[Philadelphia]] and [[Baltimore]]), [[Western Pennsylvania English|Western Pennsylvania]] (centered on [[Pittsburgh]]), [[Inland Northern American English|Inland Northern]] (centered on [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], and the [[Great Lakes region]]), [[Midland American English|Midland]] (centered on [[Indianapolis]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]) and [[Western American English|Western accents]], all of which &quot;are now more different from each other than they were fifty or a hundred years ago.&quot; Meanwhile, the unique features of the [[Eastern New England English|Eastern New England]] (centered on [[Boston]]) and [[New York City English|New York City accents]] appear to be stable. &quot;On the other hand, dialects of many smaller cities have receded in favor of the new regional patterns&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;Labov 2010&quot;/&gt; for example, the traditional accents of [[Charleston, SC|Charleston]] and of [[Cincinnati, OH|Cincinnati]] have given way to the general Midland accent, and of [[St. Louis, MO|St. Louis]] now approaches the sounds of an Inland Northern or Midland accent. At the same time, the [[Southern American English|Southern accent]], despite its huge geographic coverage,&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;/&gt; &quot;is on the whole slowly receding due to cultural stigma: younger speakers everywhere in the South are shifting away from the [[markedness|marked]] features of Southern speech.&quot; Finally, the [[High Tider|&quot;Hoi Toider&quot; dialect]] shows the paradox of receding among younger speakers in North Carolina's [[Outer Banks]] islands, yet strengthening in the islands of the [[Chesapeake Bay]].

&lt;div&gt;
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
{{Map of American English}} The map above shows the major regional dialects of American English (in [[all caps]]) plus smaller and more local dialects, as demarcated primarily by Labov et al.'s ''[[Atlas of North American English]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the related Telsur Project's [http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/home.html#regional regional maps]. Any region may also contain speakers of a &quot;[[General American]]&quot; accent that resists the marked features of their region. Furthermore, this map does not account for speakers of ethnic or cultural varieties (such as [[African-American Vernacular English]], [[Chicano English]], [[Cajun English]], etc.). All regional American English, unless specifically stated otherwise, can be assumed to be [[rhoticity in English|rhotic]], with the [[father–bother merger|''father–bother'' merger]], [[Mary–marry–merry merger|''Mary–marry–merry'' merger]], and [[/æ/ tensing|pre-nasal &quot;short ''a''&quot; tensing]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Dialects are considered &quot;[[rhoticity in English|rhotic]]&quot; if they pronounce the ''r'' sound in all historical environments, without ever &quot;dropping&quot; this sound. The [[father–bother merger|''father–bother'' merger]] is the pronunciation of the unrounded {{IPAc-en|ɒ}} vowel variant (as in ''cot, lot, bother'', etc.) the same as the {{IPAc-en|ɑː}} vowel (as in ''spa, haha, Ma''), causing words like ''con'' and ''Kahn'' and like ''sob'' and ''[[Saab Automobile|Saab]]'' to [[homophone|sound identical]], with the vowel usually realized in the back or middle of the mouth as {{IPA|[ɑ~ä]}}. Finally, most of the U.S. participates in a continuous nasal system of the &quot;short ''a''&quot; vowel (in ''cat, trap, bath'', etc.), causing {{IPA|/æ/}} to be pronounced with the tongue raised and with a glide quality (typically sounding like {{IPA|[ɛə]}}) particularly when before a [[nasal consonant]]; thus, ''mad'' is {{IPA|[mæd]}}, but ''man'' is more like {{IPA|[mɛən]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern New England===
{{main|Eastern New England English}}
[[Markedness|Marked]] New England speech is mostly associated with eastern New England, centering on Boston and Providence, and traditionally includes some notable degree of [[rhoticity|''r''-dropping]] (or non-rhoticity),&lt;ref name=&quot;Labov 2006 137, 141&quot;/&gt; as well as the [[back vowel|back tongue positioning]] of the {{IPAc-en|uː}} vowel (to {{IPA|[u]}}) and the {{IPAc-en|aʊ}} vowel (to {{IPA|[ɑʊ~äʊ]}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;Labov 2006 230&quot;/&gt; In and north of Boston, the {{IPAc-en|ɑr}} sound is famously centralized or even fronted. Boston shows a [[cot–caught merger]], while Providence keeps the same two vowels sharply distinct.

===New York City===
{{main|New York City English}}
[[New York City English]], which prevails in a relatively small but nationally recognizable dialect region in and around [[New York City]] (including [[Long Island]] and northeastern [[New Jersey]]). Its features include some notable degree of [[Rhoticity in English|non-rhoticity]] and a locally unique [[æ tensing|short-''a'' vowel pronunciation split]]. New York City English otherwise broadly follows Northern patterns, except that the {{IPAc-en|aʊ}} vowel is fronted. The [[cot–caught merger]] is markedly resisted around New York City, as depicted in popular stereotypes like ''tawwk'' and ''cawwfee'', with this {{sm|thought}} vowel being typically tensed and diphthongal.

===South===
{{main|Southern American English}}
Most [[Older Southern American English|older Southern speech]] along the Eastern seaboard was non-rhotic, though, today, all local Southern dialects are strongly rhotic, defined most recognizably by the {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} vowel losing its [[diphthong|gliding quality]] and approaching {{IPA|[aː~äː]}}, the initiating event for the Southern Vowel Shift, which includes the famous &quot;[[Southern drawl]]&quot; that makes short [[front vowel]]s into [[gliding vowel]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Labov 2006 125&quot;/&gt;

===Inland North and North Central===
Since the mid-twentieth century, a distinctive new Northern speech pattern has developed near the Canadian border of the United States, centered on the central and eastern [[Great Lakes]] region (but only on the American side). Linguists call this region the &quot;[[Inland Northern American English|Inland North]]&quot;, as defined by its local [[Northern cities vowel shift|vowel shift]]—occurring in the same region whose &quot;standard Midwestern&quot; speech was the basis for [[General American]] in the mid-20th century (though prior to this recent vowel shift). Those not from this area frequently confuse it with the North Midland dialect treated below, referring to both, plus areas to the immediate west of the Great Lakes region, all collectively as &quot;[[Midwestern United States|the Midwest]]&quot;: a common but vaguely delineated term for what is now the central or north-central United States. The [[North Central American English|North Central or &quot;Minnesotan&quot;]] dialect is also prevalent in the [[Upper Midwest]], and is characterized by influences from the German and Scandinavian settlers of the region (like &quot;yah&quot; for yes, pronounced similarly to &quot;ja&quot; in German, Norwegian and Swedish). In parts of [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Ohio]], another dialect known as [[Pennsylvania Dutch English]] is also spoken.

===Midland===
Between the traditional American dialect areas of the &quot;North&quot; and &quot;South&quot; is what linguists have long called the &quot;Midland&quot;. This geographically overlaps with some states situated in the lower Midwest. West of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] begins the broad zone of modern-day [[Midland American English|Midland speech]] . Its vocabulary has been divided into two discrete subdivisions, the &quot;North Midland&quot; that begins north of the [[Ohio River]] valley area, and the &quot;South Midland&quot; speech, which to the American ear has a slight trace of the &quot;[[Southern American English|Southern accent]]&quot; (especially due to some degree of {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} glide weakening). The South Midland dialect follows the [[Ohio River]] in a generally southwesterly direction, moves across [[Arkansas]] and [[Oklahoma]] west of the [[Mississippi river|Mississippi]], and peters out in [[West Texas]]. Modern Midland speech is transitional regarding a presence or absence of the [[cot–caught merger]]. Historically, Pennsylvania was a home of the Midland dialect, however, this state of early English-speaking settlers has now largely split off into new dialect regions, with distinct [[Philadelphia English|Philadelphia]] and [[Pittsburgh dialect]]s documented since the latter half of the twentieth century.

===West===
{{main|Western American English}}
A generalized Midland speech continues westward until becoming a somewhat internally diverse [[Western American English]] that unites the entire western half of the country. This Western dialect is mostly unified by a firm [[cot–caught merger]] and a [[conservative (linguistics)|conservative]]ly backed pronunciation of the long ''oh'' sound in ''goat, toe, show'', etc., but a fronted pronunciation of the long ''oo'' sound in ''goose, lose, tune,'' etc. Western speech itself contains such advanced sub-types as [[Pacific Northwest English]] and [[California English]], with the [[Chicano English]] accent also being a sub-type primarily of the Western accent. In the immediate [[San Francisco]] area, some older speakers do not have the normal Western cot–caught merger. The island state of [[Hawaii]], though primarily English-speaking, is also home to a [[creole language]] known commonly as [[Hawaiian Pidgin]], and some native Hawaiians may even speak English with a Pidgin accent.

===Other varieties===
Although no longer region-specific,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Trudgill, p.42.&lt;/ref&gt; [[African American Vernacular English]], which remains prevalent particularly among working- and middle-class [[African Americans]], has a close relationship to Southern dialects and has greatly influenced everyday speech of many Americans, including [[hip hop culture]]. The same aforementioned socioeconomic groups, but among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]], have also developed native-speaker varieties of English. The best-studied Latino Englishes are [[Chicano English]], spoken in the West and Midwest, and [[New York Latino English]], spoken in the [[New York metropolitan area]]. Additionally, ethnic varieties such as [[Yeshivish|Yeshiva English]] and &quot;[[Yinglish]]&quot; are spoken by some [[American Jews]], and [[Cajun English|Cajun Vernacular English]] by some [[Cajun]]s in southern Louisiana.

Compared with [[English language in England|English as spoken in England]], North American English&lt;ref&gt;''[[North American English]]'' (Trudgill, p. 2) is a collective term used for the varieties of the English language that are spoken in both the United States and [[Canada]].&lt;/ref&gt; is more homogeneous, and any North American accent that exhibits a majority of the most common phonological features is known as &quot;[[General American]].&quot; This section mostly refers to such widespread or mainstream pronunciation features that characterize American English.

Studies on historical usage of English in both the United States and the United Kingdom suggest that spoken American English did not simply deviate away from period British English, but retained certain now-archaic features contemporary [[British English]] has since lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-the-difference-between-theater-and-theatre.htm |title=What Is the Difference between Theater and Theatre? |publisher=Wisegeek.org |date=2015-05-15 |accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these is the rhoticity common in most American accents, because in the 17th century, when English was brought to the Americas, most English in England was also rhotic. The preservation of rhoticity has been further supported by the influences of [[Hiberno-English]], [[West Country English]] and [[Scottish English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=25484343 |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/25484343?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102054774863 |title=Early Mainland Residues in Southern Hiberno-English |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013 |doi=10.2307/25484343 |volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most varieties of North American English, the sound corresponding to the letter {{Angbr|r}} is a [[postalveolar approximant]] {{IPA|[ɹ̠]}} or [[retroflex approximant]] {{IPA|[ɻ]}} rather than a trill or tap (as often heard, for example, in the English accents of Scotland or India). A unique &quot;bunched tongue&quot; variant of the approximant ''r'' sound is also associated with the United States, and seems particularly noticeable in the Midwest and South.&lt;ref&gt;''A Handbook of Varieties of English'', Bernd Kortmann &amp; Edgar W. Schneider, Walter de Gruyter, 2004, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Non-RhoticityUSA.png|thumb|250px|The red dots show every U.S. metropolitan area where over 50% non-rhotic speech has been documented among some of that area's local white speakers. Non-rhotic speech may be heard from [[African American Vernacular English|black speakers]] throughout the whole country.&lt;ref&gt;Labov, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Traditionally, the &quot;East Coast&quot; comprises three or four major linguistically distinct regions, each of which possesses English varieties both distinct from each other as well as quite internally diverse: [[New England]], the [[New York metropolitan area]], the [[Mid-Atlantic states]] (centering on Philadelphia and Baltimore), and the [[Southern United States]]. The only [[rhoticity in English|''r''-dropping]] (or non-rhotic) regional accents of American English are all spoken along the East Coast, except the Mid-Atlantic region, because these areas were in close historical contact with [[England]] and imitated prestigious varieties of English at a time when these were undergoing changes;&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular, the London prestige of [[Rhoticity in English|non-rhoticity]] (or dropping the {{angbr|r}} sound, except before vowels) from the 17th century onwards, which is now widespread throughout most of England. Today, non-rhoticity is confined in the United States to the accents of [[New England English|eastern New England]], the [[older Southern American English|former plantation South]], [[New York City English|New York City]], and [[African American Vernacular English]] (though the vowel-consonant cluster found in &quot;bird&quot;, &quot;work&quot;, &quot;hurt&quot;, &quot;learn&quot;, etc. usually retains its ''r'' pronunciation today, even in these non-rhotic accents). Other than these varieties, American accents are [[Rhoticity in English|rhotic]], pronouncing every instance of the {{angbr|r}} sound.

Many British accents have evolved in other ways compared to which [[General American English]] has remained relatively more [[conservative (linguistics)|conservative]], for example, regarding the typical southern British features of a [[trap–bath split]], fronting of {{IPAc-en|oʊ}}, and [[H-dropping]]. The innovation of [[T-glottalization|/t/ glottaling]], which does occur before a consonant (including a syllabic [[Coronal consonant|coronal]] [[nasal consonant]], like in the words ''button'' or ''satin'') and word-finally in General American, additionally occurs variably between vowels in British English. On the other hand, General American is more innovative than the dialects of England, or English elsewhere in the world, in a number of its own ways:

* The [[Phonological history of the low back vowels#Father–bother merger|merger of {{IPA|/ɑ/}} and {{IPA|/ɒ/}}]], making ''father'' and ''bother'' rhyme. This change, known as the ''father–bother'' merger&lt;!--Link already present in previous sentence.--&gt; is in a transitional or completed stage nearly universally in North American English. Exceptions are in northeastern [[New England English]], such as the [[Boston accent]], [[New York City English]], [[Philadelphia English]], [[Baltimore English]]{{verification needed|reason=Verification needed for Philadelphia and Baltimore|date=May 2017}}, and many [[Southern American English|Southern dialects]], such as the [[Yat dialect]].{{clarification needed|reason=Verification needed for &quot;many&quot; Southern dialects. As New York City English had an influence on the accent of New Orleans, this may actually be a case of diffusion of a New York City feature into New Orleans.|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref name=Wells&gt;{{cite book |author=[[John C.

(2006), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;
* About half of all Americans merge of the vowels {{IPA|/ɑ/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}}. This is the so-called [[cot–caught merger]], where words like ''cot'' and ''caught'' are [[homophone]]s. This change has occurred most firmly in eastern New England (Boston area), [[Pittsburgh English|Greater Pittsburgh]], and the whole western half of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* For speakers who do not merge ''caught'' and ''cot'', the [[lot–cloth split]] has taken hold. This change took place prior to the unrounding of the ''cot''.  It is the result of the lengthening and raising of the ''cot'' vowel, merging with the ''caught'' vowel in many cases before [[voiceless fricative]]s (as in ''cloth, off''), which is also found in some varieties of British English, as well as before {{IPA|/ŋ/}} (as in ''strong, long),'' usually in ''gone,'' often in ''on,'' and irregularly before {{IPA|/ɡ/}} ''(log, hog, dog, fog'').
* The ''strut'' vowel, rather than the ''lot'' or ''thought'' vowel, is used in the function words ''was, of, from, what, everybody, nobody, somebody, anybody'', and, for some speakers, ''because'' and ''want'', when stressed.&lt;ref&gt;According to ''Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary, Eleventh Edition''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.infoplease.com/want |title=Want: meaning and definitions|publisher=Dictionary.infoplease.com |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/55/W0025500.html |title=want.

* [[English-language vowel changes before historic r|Vowel mergers]] before intervocalic {{IPA|/ɹ/}}: The [[Mary–marry–merry merger|Mary–marry–merry]], [[Mirror–nearer merger|serious–Sirius]], and [[English-language vowel changes before historic r#Hurry–furry merger|hurry–furry]] mergers are found in most American English dialects.  However, exceptions exist primarily along the east coast.
** Americans vary slightly in their pronunciations of [[R-colored vowel#Rhotacization|R-colored vowels]]&amp;mdash;such as those in {{IPA|/ɛəɹ/}} and {{IPA|/ɪəɹ/}}&amp;mdash;sometimes monophthongizing towards {{IPA|[ɛɹ]}} and {{IPA|[ɪɹ]}} or [[tenseness|tensing]] towards {{IPA|[eɪɹ]}} and {{IPA|[i(ə)ɹ]}} respectively, causing pronunciations like {{IPA|[pʰeɪɹ]}} for ''pair''/''pear'' and {{IPA|[pʰiəɹ]}} for ''peer''/''pier''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Accents of English|volume=3|publisher=Cambridge University Press|author=J. C. Wells|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=484eVQ7t8TMC&amp;dq=accents+of+english+cambridge&amp;q=481#v=onepage&amp;q=%22long%20vowels%20before%20%2Fr%2F%22&amp;f|pages=481–482}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, {{IPA|/jʊər/}} is often reduced to {{IPA|[jɚ]}}, so that ''cure'', ''pure'', and ''mature'' may all end with the sound {{IPA|[ɚ]}}, thus rhyming with ''blur'' and ''sir''. The word ''sure'' is also part of this rhyming set as it is commonly pronounced {{IPA|[ʃɚ]}}.
* [[English consonant-cluster reductions#''Yod''-dropping|Dropping of {{IPA|/j/}}]] is much more extensive than in most of England. In most North American accents, {{IPA|/j/}} is dropped after all [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] and interdental consonants (i.e. everywhere except after /p/, /b/, /f/, /h/, /k/, and /m/) so that ''new, duke, Tuesday, presume'' are pronounced {{IPA|[nu]}}, {{IPA|[duk]}}, {{IPA|[ˈtʰuzdeɪ]}}, {{IPA|[pʰɹɪˈzum]}}.
* [[/æ/ tensing]] in environments that vary widely from accent to accent. With most American speakers, for whom the phoneme {{IPA|/æ/}} operates under a somewhat continuous system, {{IPA|/æ/}} has both a tense and a lax [[allophone]] (with a kind of &quot;continuum&quot; of possible sounds between those two extremes, rather than a definitive split). In these accents, {{IPA|/æ/}} is overall realized before [[nasal stop]]s as more tense (approximately {{IPA|[eə̯]}}), while other environments are more lax (approximately the standard {{IPA|[æ]}}); for example, note the vowel sound in {{IPA|[mæs]}} for ''mass'', but {{IPA|[meə̯n]}} for ''man''). In some American accents, though, specifically those from [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[New York City]], {{IPA|[æ]}} and {{IPA|[eə̯]}} are entirely separate (or &quot;split&quot;) phonemes, for example, in ''planet'' {{IPA|[pʰɫænɪ̈t̚]}} vs. ''plan it'' {{IPA|[pʰɫeənɪ̈t̚]}}. This is often called the Mid-Atlantic [[/æ/#Phonemic tensing|split-''a'']] system. Note that these vowels move in the opposite direction in the mouth compared to the backed British &quot;[[broad A]]&quot;; this phenomenon has been noted as related to the increasingly rare phenomenon of older speakers of the eastern New England (Boston) area for whom {{IPA|/æ/}} changes to {{IPA|/ɑ/}} before {{IPA|/f/, /s/, /θ/, /ð/, /z/, /v/}} alone or when preceded by a [[homorganic]] nasal.

{{/æ/ tensing in North American English|hidden=yes}}

* [[Flapping]] of intervocalic {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} to [[alveolar tap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}} before unstressed vowels (as in ''bu'''tt'''er'' {{IPA|[ˈbʌɾəɹ]}}, ''par'''t'''y'' {{IPA|[ˈpʰɑɹɾi]}}) and syllabic {{IPA|/l/}} (''bo'''tt'''le'' {{IPA|[ˈbɑɾəɫ]}}), as well as at the end of a word or morpheme before any vowel (''wha'''t''' else'' {{IPA|[wʌˈɾɛɫs]}}, ''wha'''t'''ever'' {{IPA|[wʌˈɾɛvəɹ]}}). Thus, for most speakers, pairs such as ''ladder/latter, metal/medal,'' and ''coating/coding'' are pronounced the same, except with the stressed {{IPA|/aɪ/}} (see below).
* [[Canadian raising]] of {{IPA|/aɪ/}}: many speakers split the sound {{IPA|/aɪ/}} based on its presence before either a voiceless or voiced consonant, so that in ''writer'' it is pronounced {{IPA|[ʌɪ]}} but in ''rider'' it is pronounced {{IPA|[äɪ]}} (because {{IPA|[t]}} is a voiceless consonant while {{IPA|[d]}} is voiced). This is a form of [[Canadian raising]] but, unlike more extreme forms of that process, does not affect {{IPA|/aʊ/}}. In many areas and idiolects, a distinction between what elsewhere become homophones through this process is maintained by vowel lengthening in the vowel preceding the formerly voiced consonant, ''e.g.'', {{IPA|[ˈɹʌɪɾɚ]}} for &quot;writer&quot; as opposed to {{IPA|[ˈɹäɪɾɚ]}} for &quot;rider&quot;.
** Many speakers in the [[Inland Northern American English|Inland North]], [[North Central American English]], and [[Philadelphia English|Philadelphia]] dialect areas raise {{IPA|/aɪ/}} before voiced consonants in certain words as well, particularly {{IPA|[d]}}, {{IPA|[g]}} and {{IPA|[n]}}. Hence, words like ''tiny'', ''spider'', ''cider'', ''tiger'', ''dinosaur'', ''cyber-'', ''beside'', ''idle'' (but sometimes not ''idol''), and ''fire'' may contain a raised nucleus. The use of {{IPA|[ʌɪ]}} rather than {{IPA|[aɪ]}} in such words is unpredictable from phonetic environment alone, though it may have to do with their acoustic similarity to other words that ''do'' contain {{IPA|[ʌɪ]}} before a voiceless consonant, per the traditional Canadian-raising system. Hence, some researchers have argued that there has been a [[phonemic split]] in these dialects; the distribution of the two sounds is becoming more unpredictable among younger speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1087&amp;context=curej|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|title=The Spread of Raising: Opacity, lexicalization, and diffusion|date=November 11, 2007|accessdate=September 21, 2016|last=Freuhwald|first=Josef T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[T glottalization]] is common when {{IPA|/t/}} is in the final position of a syllable or word (''get'', ''fretful'': {{IPA|[ɡɛʔ]}}, {{IPA|[ˈfɹɛʔfəɫ]}}), though this is always superseded by the aforementioned rules of flapping
*L-velarization: England's typical distinction between a &quot;clear L&quot; (i.e. [[l (IPA)|{{IPA|[l]}}]]) and a &quot;dark L&quot; (i.e. [[velarized alveolar lateral approximant|{{IPA|[ɫ]}}]] or sometimes even [[Velar lateral approximant|{{IPA|[ʟ]}}]]) is much less noticeable in nearly all dialects of American English; it may even be altogether absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language Talent and Brain Activity: Trends in Applied Linguistics|editors=Grzegorz Dogil, Susanne Maria Reiterer, and Walter de Gruyter|year=2009|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH|page=299|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfIGxRtdXsQC&amp;pg=PA299&amp;dq=&quot;general+american&quot;+&quot;velarized&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, most U.S. speakers pronounce all &quot;L&quot; sounds with a tendency to be &quot;dark&quot;, meaning with some degree of [[velarization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1982|p=490}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only notable exceptions to this are in some Spanish-influenced U.S. English varieties (such as [[New York Latino English|East Coast Latino English]], which typically shows a clear &quot;L&quot; in [[syllable onset]]s); in [[New York City English]], where the {{IPA|/l/}} is clear in prevocalic positions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=John C.|title=Accents of English: Vowel 3: Beyond the British Isles|date=April 8, 1982|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=515|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Accents_of_English_Volume_3.html?id=484eVQ7t8TMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in older, [[wikt:moribund|moribund]] [[Southern American English|Southern speech]] of the U.S., where &quot;L&quot; is clear in an [[intervocalic consonant|intervocalic]] environment between [[front vowel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''A Handbook of Varieties of English'', Bernd Kortmann &amp; Edgar W. Schneider, Walter de Gruyter, 2004, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Both intervocalic {{IPA|/nt/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} may commonly be realized as {{IPA|[ɾ̃]}} or simply {{IPA|[n]}}, making ''winter'' and ''winner'' homophones in fast or non-careful speech.
*The vowel {{IPA|/ɪ/}} in unstressed syllables generally merges with {{IPA|/ə/}} ([[Phonological history of English high front vowels#Weak-vowel merger|weak-vowel merger]]), so ''roses'' is pronounced like ''Rosa's''.

Some mergers found in most varieties of both American and British English include:
*[[Horse–hoarse merger]], making the vowels {{IPA|/ɔ/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} before 'r' homophones, with homophonous pairs like ''horse/hoarse, corps/core, for/four, morning/mourning, war/wore,'' etc. [[homophone]]s.
*[[Wine–whine merger]], making pairs like ''wine/whine, wet/whet, Wales/whales, wear/where,'' etc. [[homophone]]s, in most cases eliminating {{IPA|/ʍ/}}, the [[voiceless labiovelar fricative]]. Many older varieties of southern and western American English still keep these distinct, but the merger appears to be spreading.

==Vocabulary==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2009}}
North America has given the English [[lexicon]] many thousands of words, meanings, and phrases. Several thousand are now used in English as spoken internationally.

===Creation of an American lexicon===
The process of coining new lexical items started as soon as the colonists began borrowing names for unfamiliar flora, fauna, and topography from the [[Native American languages]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Skeat&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ltoDXfkzZGsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=moose+etymology&amp;ots=sSxd8GVMPH&amp;sig=8iFiF5oNiF2E0U5LHoZUUF1dHHU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=falseM |title=Principles of English etymology: The native element - Walter William Skeat |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such names are ''[[Virginia opossum|opossum]], [[raccoon]], [[squash (fruit)|squash]]'' and ''[[moose]]'' (from [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Skeat&quot; /&gt; Other Native American loanwords, such as ''[[wigwam]]'' or ''[[moccasin]]'', describe articles in common use among Native Americans. The languages of the other colonizing nations also added to the American vocabulary; for instance, ''[[cookie]]'', ''[[cruller]]'', ''[[Urban stoop|stoop]]'', and ''pit'' (of a fruit) from [[Dutch Language|Dutch]]; ''[[angst]], [[kindergarten]], [[sauerkraut]]'' from [[German language|German]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://german.about.com/library/blvoc_gerloan.htm|title=You Already Know Some German Words!|publisher=|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[levee]], portage'' (&quot;carrying of boats or goods&quot;) and (probably) ''[[gopher (animal)|gopher]]'' from [[French language|French]]; ''[[barbecue]]{{dubious|date=April 2016}}, [[stevedore]], and [[rodeo]]'' from [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/dissertations/AAI9308630/ |title=&quot;The history of Mexican folk foodways of South Texas: Street vendors, o&quot; by Mario Montano |publisher=Repository.upenn.edu |date=1992-01-01 |accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ROmDu-bYMRYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=rodeo+etymology&amp;ots=Q8MWUXWWeS&amp;sig=1mCnpypy9pF4E4WoGV_gSVXElGk#v=onepage&amp;q=rodeo&amp;f=false |title=What's in a Word?: Etymological Gossip about Some Interesting English Words - Robert M.

Among the earliest and most notable regular &quot;English&quot; additions to the American vocabulary, dating from the early days of colonization through the early 19th century, are terms describing the features of the North American landscape; for instance, ''run, branch, fork, [[wikt:snag|snag]], [[hill|bluff]], [[gulch]], neck'' (of the woods), ''barrens, [[bottomland]], notch, knob, riffle, [[rapid]]s, watergap, cutoff, [[trail]], [[tree line|timberline]]'' and ''[[water divide|divide]].''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Already existing words such as ''[[stream|creek]], [[swamp|slough]], [[Ice pellets|sleet]]'' and (in later use) ''[[Drainage basin|watershed]]'' received new meanings that were unknown in England.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Other noteworthy American [[toponym]]s are found among loanwords; for example, ''[[prairie]], [[butte]]'' (French); ''[[bayou]]'' ([[Choctaw]] via Louisiana French); ''[[coulee]]'' (Canadian French, but used also in Louisiana with a different meaning); ''[[canyon]], [[mesa]], [[arroyo (creek)|arroyo]]'' (Spanish); ''vlei, skate, [[kill (body of water)|kill]]'' (Dutch, [[Hudson Valley]]).

The word ''[[wikt:corn|corn]]'', used in England to refer to wheat (or any cereal), came to denote the plant ''[[Zea mays]]'', the most important crop in the U.S., originally named ''[[Indian corn]]'' by the earliest settlers; wheat, rye, barley, oats, etc. came to be collectively referred to as ''[[grain]]''. Other notable farm related vocabulary additions were the new meanings assumed by ''[[barn]]'' (not only a building for hay and grain storage, but also for housing livestock) and ''team'' (not just the horses, but also the vehicle along with them), as well as, in various periods, the terms ''[[rangeland|range]], [[corn crib|(corn) crib]], [[truck farm|truck]], [[grain elevator|elevator]], [[sharecropping]]'' and ''[[feedlot]].''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

''[[Ranch]],'' later applied to a [[ranch house|house style]], derives from [[Mexican Spanish]]; most Spanish contributions came after the [[War of 1812]], with the opening of the West. Among these are, other than toponyms, ''[[chaps]]'' (from ''chaparreras), [[plaza]], [[lasso]], [[bronco]], [[Wikt:buckaroo|buckaroo]], [[rodeo]];'' examples of &quot;English&quot; additions from the [[cowboy]] era are ''bad man,{{clarify|date=September 2015}} maverick, chuck'' (&quot;food&quot;) and ''[[Boot Hill]];'' from the [[California Gold Rush]] came such idioms as ''hit pay dirt'' or ''strike it rich.'' The word ''blizzard'' probably originated in the West. A couple of notable late 18th century additions are the verb ''belittle'' and the noun ''bid,'' both first used in writing by [[Thomas Jefferson]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

With the new continent developed new forms of dwelling, and hence a large inventory of words designating real estate concepts ''(land office, [[Land lot|lot]], outlands, waterfront,'' the verbs ''locate'' and ''relocate, betterment, addition, subdivision),'' types of property ''([[log cabin]], [[adobe]]'' in the 18th century; ''[[frame house]], [[apartment]], tenement house, [[shack]], [[Wikt:shanty|shanty]]'' in the 19th century; ''project, [[condominium]], [[townhouse]], [[split-level home|split-level]], [[mobile home]], multi-family'' in the 20th century), and parts thereof ''([[driveway]], breezeway, [[backyard]], dooryard; [[Clapboard (architecture)|clapboard]], [[siding]], trim, [[baseboard]]; stoop'' (from Dutch), ''family room, den;'' and, in recent years, ''[[HVAC]], [[central air]], walkout basement).''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Ever since the [[American Revolution]], a great number of terms connected with the U.S. political institutions have entered the language; examples are ''run (i.e, for office), gubernatorial, [[primary election]], [[carpetbagger]]'' (after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]), ''repeater'', ''[[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]]'' (a [[United Kingdom|British]] term used originally in Banking)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.word-detective.com/back-f.html |title=Lame Duck |publisher=Word Detective.com |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[pork barrel]].'' Some of these are internationally used (for example, ''[[caucus]], [[gerrymander]], [[filibuster]], [[exit poll]]).''

====19th century onwards====
The development of industry and material innovations throughout the 19th and 20th centuries were the source of a massive stock of distinctive new words, phrases and idioms. Typical examples are the vocabulary of ''[[railroad]]ing'' (see further at [[rail terminology]]) and ''[[transport]]ation'' terminology, ranging from names of roads (from ''dirt roads'' and ''back roads'' to ''[[freeway]]s'' and ''[[parkway]]s)'' to road infrastructure ''([[parking lot]], [[overpass]], [[rest area]]),'' and from automotive terminology to ''[[public transit]]'' (for example, in the sentence &quot;''riding'' the ''subway downtown''&quot;); such American introductions as ''commuter'' (from ''commutation ticket), [[concourse]], to board'' (a vehicle), ''to park, double-park'' and ''parallel park'' (a car), ''[[Wikt:double decker|double decker]]'' or the noun ''terminal'' have long been used in all dialects of English.&lt;ref&gt;A few of these are now chiefly found, or have been more productive, outside of the U.S.; for example, ''jump,'' &quot;to drive past a traffic signal&quot;; ''block'' meaning &quot;building&quot;, and ''center,'' &quot;central point in a town&quot; or &quot;main area for a particular activity&quot; (cf. Oxford English Dictionary).&lt;/ref&gt;

Trades of various kinds have endowed (American) English with household words describing jobs and occupations ''([[bartender]], longshoreman, patrolman, [[hobo]], [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]], bellhop, [[roustabout]], [[White-collar worker|white collar]], [[blue collar]], [[employee]], boss'' [from Dutch], ''[[intern]], [[busboy]], [[mortician]], [[senior citizen]]),'' businesses and workplaces ''([[department store]], [[supermarket]], [[thrift store]], [[gift shop]], [[Pharmacy|drugstore]], [[motel]], [[main street]], [[gas station]], [[hardware store]], [[Savings and loan association|savings and loan]], hock'' [also from Dutch]), as well as general concepts and innovations ''([[automated teller machine]], [[smart card]], [[cash register]], [[dishwasher]], reservation'' [as at hotels], ''pay envelope, [[movie]], mileage, [[shortage]], [[power outage|outage]], [[blood bank]]).''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Already existing English words—such as ''[[General store|store]], [[Retailing|shop]], dry goods, [[haberdashery]], [[lumber]]''—underwent shifts in meaning; some—such as ''[[wiktionary:Mason|mason]], student, [[clerk (position)|clerk]]'', the verbs ''can'' (as in &quot;canned goods&quot;), ''ship, fix, carry, enroll'' (as in school), ''run'' (as in &quot;run a business&quot;), ''release'' and ''haul''—were given new significations, while others (such as ''[[tradesman]])'' have retained meanings that disappeared in England. From the world of business and finance came ''[[break-even]], [[merger]], [[Wikt:delisting|delisting]], [[downsize]], [[disintermediation]], [[Net income|bottom line]];'' from sports terminology came, jargon aside, ''Monday-morning quarterback, cheap shot, game plan'' ([[American football|football]]); ''in the [[ballpark]], out of [[left field]], off base, hit and run,'' and [[English language idioms derived from baseball|many other idioms]] from [[baseball]]; gamblers coined ''[[bluff (poker)|bluff]], [[Wikt:blue chip|blue chip]], [[Betting (poker)#Ante|ante]], bottom dollar, raw deal, pass the buck, ace in the hole, freeze-out, showdown;'' miners coined ''[[bedrock]], bonanza, peter out, pan out'' and the verb ''prospect'' from the noun; and railroadmen are to be credited with ''make the [[grade (slope)|grade]], sidetrack, head-on,'' and the verb ''railroad.'' A number of Americanisms describing material innovations remained largely confined to North America: ''[[elevator]], [[ground (electricity)|ground]], [[gasoline]];'' many automotive terms fall in this category, although many do not ''([[hatchback]], [[sport utility vehicle]], [[station wagon]], [[trunk (automobile)#Tailgate|tailgate]], [[motorhome]], [[truck]], [[pickup truck]], to exhaust).''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In addition to the above-mentioned loans from French, Spanish, Mexican Spanish, Dutch, and Native American languages, other accretions from foreign languages came with 19th and early 20th century immigration; notably, from [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] ''([[chutzpah]], schmooze, tush'') and [[German language|German]]—''[[hamburger]]'' and culinary terms like ''frankfurter/franks, liverwurst, sauerkraut, [[Hot dog|wiener]], [[delicatessen|deli(catessen)]]; [[scram]], [[kindergarten]], [[Responses to sneezing|gesundheit]];''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=19970923 |title=The Maven's Word of the Day: gesundheit |publisher=[[Random House]] |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; musical terminology ''([[whole note]], [[half note]],'' etc.); and apparently ''[[cookbook]], fresh'' (&quot;impudent&quot;) and ''what gives?'' Such constructions as ''Are you coming with?'' and ''I like to dance'' (for &quot;I like dancing&quot;) may also be the result of German or Yiddish influence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Trudgill|Trudgill, Peter]] (2004). ''New-Dialect Formation: The Inevitability of Colonial Englishes''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, a large number of English colloquialisms from various periods are American in origin; some have lost their American flavor (from ''[[Okay|OK]]'' and ''cool'' to ''[[nerd]]'' and ''[[24/7]]),'' while others have not ''([[have a nice day]], for sure);''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl?nav=on&amp;which_entry=009421%23x1%23x1%23day&amp;selected_word=day&amp;search_word=day |title=Definition of day noun from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary|publisher=Oup.com |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl?nav=on&amp;which_entry=036903%23x1%23x1%23sure&amp;selected_word=sure&amp;search_word=sure#sure_adv |title=Definition of sure adjective from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary|publisher=Oup.com |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; many are now distinctly old-fashioned ''(swell, groovy).'' Some English words now in general use, such as ''hijacking, [[disc jockey]], boost, bulldoze'' and ''[[jazz]],'' originated as American slang. Among the many English idioms of U.S. origin are ''get the hang of, bark up the wrong tree, keep tabs, run scared, take a backseat, have an edge over, stake a claim, take a shine to, in on the ground floor, bite off more than one can chew, off/on the wagon, stay put, inside track, [[stiff upper lip]], bad hair day, [[monkeywrenching|throw a monkey wrench/monkeywrenching]], under the weather, jump bail, come clean, come again?, it ain't over till it's over,'' and ''what goes around comes around.''{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Morphology===
American English has always shown a marked tendency [[functional shift|to use nouns as verbs]].&lt;ref name = &quot;iqiyyl&quot;&gt;Trudgill, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of verbed nouns are ''interview, advocate, vacuum, lobby, pressure, rear-end, transition, feature, profile, spearhead, skyrocket, showcase, service'' (as a car), ''corner, torch, exit'' (as in &quot;exit the lobby&quot;), ''factor'' (in mathematics), ''gun'' (&quot;shoot&quot;), ''author'' (which disappeared in English around 1630 and was revived in the U.S. three centuries later) and, out of American material, ''proposition, graft'' (bribery), ''bad-mouth, [[vacation]], major, [[backpack]], [[backtracking|backtrack]], intern, ticket'' (traffic violations), ''hassle, [[asphalt concrete|blacktop]], peer-review, dope'' and ''[[Drug overdose|OD]]'', and, of course ''verbed'' as used at the start of this sentence.

[[Compound (linguistics)|Compound]]s coined in the U.S. are for instance ''[[foothill]], [[flatlands]], [[badlands]], [[landslide]]'' (in all senses), ''[[:wikt:overview|overview]]'' (the noun), ''[[Wikt:backdrop|backdrop]], [[teenager]], [[brainstorming|brainstorm]], [[Wikt:bandwagon|bandwagon]], [[hitchhike]], smalltime, [[Wikt:deadbeat|deadbeat]], [[frontman]], lowbrow'' and ''highbrow, hell-bent, foolproof, nitpick, about-face'' (later verbed), ''upfront'' (in all senses), ''fixer-upper, no-show;'' many of these are phrases used as adverbs or (often) hyphenated attributive adjectives: ''[[non-profit]], [[for-profit]], free-for-all, ready-to-wear, catchall, low-down, down-and-out, down and dirty, in-your-face, nip and tuck;'' many compound nouns and adjectives are open: ''[[happy hour]], [[fall guy]], [[capital gain]], [[road trip]], wheat pit, head start, [[plea bargain]];'' some of these are colorful ''([[empty nester]], [[loan shark]], [[Wikt:ambulance chaser|ambulance chaser]], [[buzz saw]], [[ghetto blaster]], dust bunny),'' others are euphemistic ''([[differently abled]] (physically challenged), [[human resources]], [[affirmative action]], [[correctional facility]]).''

Many compound nouns have the form verb plus preposition: ''[[Wikt:add-on|add-on]], stopover, lineup, [[Wikt:shakedown|shakedown]], tryout, spin-off, [[rundown]]'' (&quot;summary&quot;), ''[[shootout]], holdup, hideout, comeback, cookout, [[Bribery|kickback]], [[makeover]], [[takeover]], rollback'' (&quot;decrease&quot;), ''rip-off, come-on, shoo-in, fix-up, tie-in, tie-up'' (&quot;stoppage&quot;), ''stand-in.'' These essentially are nouned [[phrasal verb]]s; some prepositional and phrasal verbs are in fact of American origin ''(spell out, figure out, hold up, brace up, size up, rope in, back up/off/down/out, step down, miss out, kick around, cash in, rain out, check in'' and ''check out'' (in all senses), ''fill in'' (&quot;inform&quot;), ''kick in'' or ''throw in'' (&quot;contribute&quot;), ''square off, sock in, sock away, factor in/out, come down with, give up on, lay off'' (from employment), ''run into'' and ''across'' (&quot;meet&quot;), ''stop by, pass up, put up'' (money), ''set up'' (&quot;frame&quot;), ''trade in, pick up on, pick up after, lose out).''{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;British author [[George Orwell]] (in ''English People'', 1947, cited in OED s.v. ''lose)'' criticized an alleged &quot;American tendency&quot; to &quot;burden every verb with a preposition that adds nothing to its meaning (''win out'', ''lose out'', ''face up to'', etc.)&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Noun endings such as ''-ee (retiree), -ery (bakery), -ster (gangster)'' and ''-cian (beautician)'' are also particularly productive.&lt;ref name = &quot;iqiyyl&quot;/&gt; Some verbs ending in ''-ize'' are of U.S. origin; for example, ''fetishize, prioritize, burglarize, accessorize, itemize, editorialize, customize, notarize, [[weatherization|weatherize]], winterize, [[Miranda v. Arizona|Mirandize]];'' and so are some [[back-formation]]s ''(locate, fine-tune, evolute, curate, donate, emote, upholster, peeve'' and ''enthuse).'' Among syntactical constructions that arose in the U.S. are ''as of'' (with dates and times), ''outside of, headed for, meet up with, back of, convince someone to, not about to'' and ''lack for.''

Americanisms formed by alteration of some existing words include notably ''pesky, phony, rambunctious, pry'' (as in &quot;pry open&quot;, from ''prize), putter'' (verb), ''buddy, [[sundae]], skeeter, sashay'' and ''kitty-corner.'' Adjectives that arose in the U.S. are for example, ''lengthy, bossy, [[cuteness|cute]]'' and ''cutesy, grounded'' (of a child), ''punk'' (in all senses), ''sticky'' (of the weather), ''through'' (as in &quot;through train&quot;, or meaning &quot;finished&quot;), and many colloquial forms such as ''peppy'' or ''wacky''. American [[Blend word|blend]]s include ''[[motel]], guesstimate, [[infomercial]]'' and ''[[televangelist]].''

===English words that survived in the United States and not in the United Kingdom===
A number of words and meanings that originated in [[Middle English]] or [[Early Modern English]] and that have been in everyday use in the United States dropped out in most varieties of British English; some of these have cognates in [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowland Scots]]. Terms such as ''[[autumn|fall]]'' (&quot;autumn&quot;), ''[[faucet]]'' (&quot;tap&quot;), ''[[diaper]]'' (&quot;nappy&quot;), ''[[candy]]'' (&quot;sweets&quot;), ''[[Frying pan|skillet]]'', ''[[eyeglasses]]'' and ''[[obligate]]'' are often regarded as Americanisms. ''Fall'' for example came to denote the season in 16th century England, a contraction of Middle English expressions like &quot;fall of the leaf&quot; and &quot;fall of the year&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|fall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th century, [[British colonization of the Americas|English immigration to the British colonies]] in North America was at its peak and the new settlers took the English language with them. While the term ''fall'' gradually became obsolete in Britain, it became the more common term in North America. ''Gotten'' ([[past participle]] of ''get'') is often considered to be an Americanism, although there are some areas of [[UK|Britain]], such as [[Lancashire]] and [[North East England]], that still continue to use it and sometimes also use ''putten'' as the past participle for ''put'' (which is not done by most speakers of American English).&lt;ref&gt;''A Handbook of Varieties of English'', Bernd Kortmann &amp; Edgar W. Schneider, Walter de Gruyter, 2004, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other words and meanings, to various extents, were brought back to Britain, especially in the second half of the 20th century; these include ''hire'' (&quot;to employ&quot;), ''quit'' (&quot;to stop&quot;, which spawned ''quitter'' in the U.S.), ''I guess'' (famously criticized by [[H. W. Fowler]]), ''[[baggage]]'', ''hit'' (a place), and the adverbs ''overly'' and ''presently'' (&quot;currently&quot;). Some of these, for example ''[[monkey wrench]]'' and ''[[wastebasket]]'', originated in 19th century Britain.

The mandative [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] (as in &quot;the City Attorney suggested that the case ''not be closed''&quot;) is livelier in American English than it is in British English. It appears in some areas as a spoken usage and is considered obligatory in contexts that are more formal. The adjectives ''mad'' meaning &quot;angry&quot;, ''smart'' meaning &quot;intelligent&quot;, and ''sick'' meaning &quot;ill&quot; are also more frequent in American (these meanings are also frequent in Hiberno-English) than British English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.com/images/elt/oald7/synald7_angry.gif |title=angry |publisher=Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.com/images/elt/oald7/synald7_intelligent.gif |title=intelligent |publisher=Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/ill |title=Definition of ill adjective from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary |publisher=Oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regionally distinct terms within the United States===
Linguist [[Bert Vaux]] created a survey, completed in 2003, polling English speakers across the United States about the specific words they would use in everyday speech for various concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Vaux, Bert and Scott Golder. 2003. [http://dialect.redlog.net/ The Harvard Dialect Survey]. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Linguistics Department.&lt;/ref&gt; This 2003 study concluded that:
*For a &quot;long sandwich that contains [[cold cut]]s, lettuce, and so on&quot;, the most common term found in the survey, throughout the country (preferred by 77% of the participants), was the word ''sub'' (an abbreviation for ''[[submarine sandwich]]''). The [[New York metropolitan area]] shows the greatest variety of terms for this idea in one single region, largely counting for the 5% of the survey who preferred the term ''hero'', nearly 7% (which is even more prevalent in the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia metropolitan areas, including southern New Jersey as well as eastern Pennsylvania) who preferred ''hoagie'', and just less than 3% (also notably prevalent throughout New England, except Maine) who prefer ''grinder''.
*The U.S. is largely divided about the &quot;generic term for a sweetened carbonated beverage&quot;. Nearly 53% of the surveyed sample preferred ''soda'', particularly in the Northeast, [[Eastern Ridges and Lowlands|eastern Wisconsin]], [[Greater St. Louis]], the far [[Western United States|West]], and some of [[South Florida]], with it [[Eastern New England English#Overview of vocabulary|also called ''tonic'']] in some parts of southeastern [[New England]]. Over 25% preferred ''pop'', particularly around the [[the Midwest|Midwest]] (including the [[Great Lakes region]]) and the Western regions along the [[Canada–US border]]. Over 12% preferred ''coke'' (which is also trademarked for a [[Coca-Cola|specific cola product]]), particularly scattered throughout the [[Southern United States|South]]. Urban, coastal California speakers use all three terms, though especially ''soda''. Speakers of the [[Western United States|West]] generally use ''soda'' or ''pop''.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Joshua (2013). &quot;[http://www4.ncsu.edu/~jakatz2/files/dialectposter.png Beyond 'Soda, Pop, or Coke].' North Carolina State University.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The most common word or phrase &quot;to address a group of two or more people&quot; (in the second [[Grammatical person|person]]) was ''you guys'' at almost 43%, particularly throughout the Northeast and Great Lakes region (along with simply ''you'' at nearly 13%). ''Y'all'' was preferred by 14%, particularly in the South, but reaching somewhat noticeably into the Northern regions as well. ''Yous(e)'' was largely confined to the New York and Philadelphia metropolitan areas, at just over 0.5%. The expression &quot;yinz&quot; is a distinctive feature of [[Western Pennsylvania]] speech.
*The most common term for generic, rubber-soled shoes worn for athletic activities is ''sneakers'' as said by 46% of those surveyed throughout the country, but particularly in the Northeast. 41%, particularly outside of the Northeast, said ''tennis shoes''. Several much rarer other terms were also documented in various regions of the country.
*Nearly 68% of the participating speakers make no distinction between ''[[dinner]]'' and ''[[supper]]'', or simply never use the term ''supper''.
*64% of the participants said they use &quot;Where are you at?&quot; to mean &quot;How are you coming along?&quot; This also incorporated the 34% who use &quot;Where are you at?&quot; in any context, for example, to even mean &quot;Where are you physically located right now?&quot;
*Freshwater &quot;[[crayfish|miniature lobsters]]&quot; were identified by 40% of polled speakers as ''crawfish'', 32% as ''crayfish'', and 19% as ''crawdads'' within no particular regional boundaries, except that ''crayfish'' was especially uncommon in the South. 5% reported having no term for this animal.
*The most common nicknames for grandparents were ''grandpa''/''grampa'' and ''grandma''/''gramma''.
*Nearly all American English speakers called the [[lampyridae|lampyrid insect]] a ''firefly'' or ''lightning bug'', with nearly 40% using the two terms interchangeably.
*The use of the word [[positive anymore|''anymore'' with a positive sense]], simply as a synonym for ''nowadays'' (e.g. ''I do only figurative paintings anymore''), was reported as sounding acceptable to 5% of participants. However, in example sentences with a clearly disheartened tone or dismissive attitude, the positive use of ''anymore'' sounded acceptable to as many as 29% of participants (e.g. ''Forget your baby wearing nice clothes anymore''). This rare use of the word was observed much more around Pennsylvania and going westward into the [[Midland American English|Midland region]].
*The [[shopping cart|&quot;wheeled contraption&quot; for carrying groceries]] was identified by 77% of participants as a ''shopping cart'' and by nearly 14% as a ''grocery cart''. 4% preferred the term ''buggy'': a clearly Southern phenomenon.

==Differences between British and American English==
{{Main article|Comparison of American and British English}}
American English and [[British English]] (BrE) often differ at the levels of phonology, phonetics, vocabulary, and, to a much lesser extent, grammar and orthography.
The first large American dictionary, ''An American Dictionary of the English Language'', known as [[Webster's Dictionary]], was written by [[Noah Webster]] in 1828, codifying several of these spellings.

Differences in grammar are relatively minor, and do not normally affect mutual intelligibility; these include: different use of some [[auxiliary verb]]s; formal (rather than notional) agreement with [[collective noun]]s; different preferences for the past forms of a few verbs (for example, AmE/BrE: ''learned''/''learnt'', ''burned''/''burnt'', ''snuck/sneaked'', ''dove/dived'') although the purportedly &quot;British&quot; forms can occasionally be seen in American English writing as well; different prepositions and adverbs in certain contexts (for example, AmE ''in school,'' BrE ''at school''&lt;!--when it means &quot;to be a student&quot;--&gt;); and whether or not a definite article is used, in very few cases (AmE ''to the hospital'', BrE ''to hospital''; contrast, however, AmE ''actress Elizabeth Taylor'', BrE ''the actress Elizabeth Taylor''). Often, these differences are a matter of relative preferences rather than absolute rules; and most are not stable, since the two varieties are constantly influencing each other,&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, John (2006). ''British or American English?''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-37993-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and American English is not a standardized set of dialects.

Differences in [[orthography]] are also minor. The main differences are that American English usually uses spellings such as ''flavor'' for British ''flavour'', ''fiber'' for ''fibre'', ''defense'' for ''defence'', ''analyze'' for ''analyse'', ''license'' for ''licence'', ''catalog'' for ''catalogue'' and ''traveling'' for ''travelling''. Noah Webster popularized such spellings in America, but he did not invent most of them. Rather, &quot;he chose already existing options [...] on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, John. &quot;The Effects of the Revolution on Language&quot;, in ''A Companion to the American Revolution''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008. p.599&lt;/ref&gt; Other differences are due to the [[francophile]] tastes of the 19th century [[Victorian era]] Britain (for example they preferred ''programme'' for ''program'', ''manoeuvre'' for ''maneuver'', ''cheque'' for ''check'', etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Pam (2004). ''The Cambridge Guide to English Usage''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-62181-X}}, pp. 34 and 511.&lt;/ref&gt; AmE almost always uses ''-ize'' in words like ''realize''. BrE prefers ''-ise'', but also uses ''-ize'' on occasion (see [[Oxford spelling]]).

There are a few differences in punctuation rules. British English is more tolerant of run-on sentences, called &quot;comma splices&quot; in American English, and American English requires that periods and commas be placed inside closing quotation marks even in cases in which British rules would place them outside. American English also favors the double quotation mark over single.&lt;ref name=&quot;APA&quot;&gt;{{cite web

AmE sometimes favors words that are [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] more complex, whereas BrE uses clipped forms, such as AmE ''transportation'' and BrE ''transport'' or where the British form is a [[back-formation]], such as AmE ''burglarize'' and BrE ''burgle'' (from ''burglar''). However, while individuals usually use one or the other, both forms will be widely understood and mostly used alongside each other within the two systems.

British English also differs from American English in that &quot;schedule&quot; can be pronounced with either [sk] or [ʃ].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=English Pronouncing Dictionary|last=Jones|first=Daniel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1991|isbn=9780521425865|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
