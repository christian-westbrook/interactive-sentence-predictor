'''Alain Connes''' ({{IPA-fr|alɛ̃ kɔn|lang}}; born 1 April 1947) is a French mathematician, currently Professor at the [[Collège de France]], [[IHÉS]], [[Ohio State University]] and [[Vanderbilt University]]. He was an Invited Professor at the [[Conservatoire national des arts et métiers]] (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Alain Connes, « Géométrie non-commutative », ''Université de tous les savoirs'', '''4''', 175-190, Editions Odile Jacob, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Alain Connes studies [[operator algebra]]s. In his early work on [[von Neumann algebra]]s in the 1970s, he succeeded in obtaining the almost complete classification of injective [[Von Neumann algebra#Factors|factor]]s. Following this he made contributions in [[K-theory|operator K-theory]] and [[index theory]], which culminated in the [[Baum–Connes conjecture]]. He also introduced [[cyclic homology|cyclic cohomology]] in the early 1980s as a first step in the study of [[noncommutative geometry|noncommutative differential geometry]]. He was a member of [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Bourbaki: a secret society of mathematicians|first=Maurice|last=Mashaal|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]|year=2006|page=18|isbn=978-0-8218-3967-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-CXn6y_1nJ8C&amp;pg=PA18}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Connes has applied his work in areas of mathematics and [[theoretical physics]], including [[number theory]], [[differential geometry]] and [[particle physics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-geometer-of-particle &quot;The Geometer of Particle Physics&quot;] '' Scientific American'', 24 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==

Connes was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in 1982, the [[Crafoord Prize]] in 2001 and the gold medal of the [[CNRS]] in 2004.  He was an [[invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians|invited speaker at the ICM]] in 1974 at Vancouver and in 1986 at Berkeley and a [[plenary speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians|plenary speaker at the ICM]] in 1978 at Helsinki. He is a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] and several foreign academies and societies, including the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters|Danish Academy of Sciences]], [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters|Norwegian Academy of Sciences]], [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], and [[National Academy of Sciences|US National Academy of Sciences]].
