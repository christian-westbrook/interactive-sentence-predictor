'''Andriscus''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀνδρίσκος}}, ''Andrískos''), also often referenced as '''Pseudo-Philip''', was the last [[King of Macedon]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}}&amp;nbsp;149–148&amp;nbsp;BC). A pretender, who claimed to be the son of [[Perseus of Macedon]], he was a [[fulling|fuller]] from [[Edremit (District), Balıkesir|Adramyttium]] in [[Aeolis]] in western [[Anatolia]]. His reign lasted just one year.

In 168 BC, the Romans invaded [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] and overthrew king [[Perseus of Macedon|Perseus]] in the [[Battle of Pydna|First Battle of Pydna]].

In 149 BC, Andriskos, claiming to be Perseus' son, announced his intention to retake Macedonia from the Romans.

As his first attempt, he travelled to [[Syria]] to request military help from [[Demetrius I of Syria|Demetrius Soter of Syria]]. Demetrius instead handed him over to the Romans but Andriskos managed to escape from Roman captivity, and raised a [[Thracians|Thracian]] army. With this army, he invaded Macedonia and defeated the Roman praetor [[Publius Juventius]] in 149 BC. Andriskos then declared himself King '''Philip VI of Macedonia'''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 148 BC, Andriskos conquered [[Thessaly]] and made an alliance with [[Carthage]], thus bringing the Roman wrath on him.
Later that year, in what the Romans called the [[Fourth Macedonian War]], he was defeated by the Roman praetor [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus]] at the [[Battle of Pydna (148 BC)|Second Battle of Pydna]], and fled to [[Thrace]], whose prince gave him up to [[Rome]], thus marking the end to Andriskos' reign of Macedonia.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Andriscus' brief reign over Macedonia was marked by cruelty and extortion. After this, Macedonia was formally reduced to a Roman province.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
