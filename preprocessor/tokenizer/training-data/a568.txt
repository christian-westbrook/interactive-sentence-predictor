'''''Allosaurus''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|l|ə|ˈ|s|ɔːr|ə|s}}&lt;ref&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Allosaurus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary.com|Allosaurus}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[genus]] of large [[theropoda|theropod]] [[dinosaur]] that lived 155 to 150&amp;nbsp;million years ago during the [[late Jurassic]] [[Period (geology)|period]] ([[Kimmeridgian]] to early [[Tithonian]]&lt;ref name=turner1999&gt;Turner, C.E. and Peterson, F., (1999). &quot;Biostratigraphy of dinosaurs in the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of the Western Interior, U.S.A.&quot; Pp. 77–114 in Gillette, D.D. (ed.), ''Vertebrate Paleontology in Utah''. Utah Geological Survey Miscellaneous Publication 99-1.&lt;/ref&gt;). The name &quot;''Allosaurus&quot;'' means &quot;different lizard&quot;. It is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἄλλος}}/''allos'' (&quot;different, other&quot;) and {{lang|grc|σαῦρος}}/''sauros'' (&quot;lizard / generic reptile&quot;). The first fossil remains that could definitively be ascribed to this genus were described in 1877 by paleontologist [[Othniel Charles Marsh]]. These remains became known as ''[[Antrodemus]]''. As one of the first well-known theropod dinosaurs, it has long attracted attention outside of [[paleontology|paleontological]] circles. Indeed, it has been a top feature in several [[film]]s and [[documentary film|documentaries]] about prehistoric life.

''Allosaurus'' was a large [[biped]]al [[predation|predator]]. Its [[skull]] was large and equipped with dozens of sharp, serrated [[tooth|teeth]]. It averaged {{convert|8.5|m|ft|abbr =on}} in length, though fragmentary remains suggest it could have reached over {{convert|12|m|ft|abbr =on}}. Relative to the large and powerful hindlimbs, its three-fingered forelimbs were small, and the body was balanced by a long and heavily muscled tail. It is classified as an [[allosaurid]], a type of [[carnosauria]]n theropod dinosaur. The genus has a complicated [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], and includes an uncertain number of valid [[species]], the best known of which is ''A. fragilis''. The bulk of ''Allosaurus'' remains have come from [[North America]]'s [[Morrison Formation]], with material also known from [[Portugal]] and possibly [[Tanzania]]. It was known for over half of the 20th century as ''[[Antrodemus]]'', but a study of the copious remains from the [[Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry]] brought the name &quot;''Allosaurus&quot;'' back to prominence and established it as one of the best-known dinosaurs.

As the most abundant large predator in the [[Morrison Formation]], ''Allosaurus'' was at the top of the [[food chain]], probably preying on contemporaneous large herbivorous dinosaurs, and perhaps even other predators. Potential prey included [[ornithopod]]s, [[stegosaurid]]s, and [[sauropod]]s. Some paleontologists interpret ''Allosaurus'' as having had cooperative [[social behavior]], and hunting in packs, while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other, and that congregations of this genus are the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses. It may have attacked large prey by ambush, using its upper jaw like a [[hatchet]].

''Allosaurus'' was a typical large [[theropod]], having a massive [[skull]] on a short [[neck]], a long [[tail]] and reduced forelimbs.

Several [[Specimens of Allosaurus|gigantic specimens]] have been attributed to ''Allosaurus'', but may in fact belong to other genera. The closely related genus ''[[Saurophaganax]]'' ([[Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History|OMNH]] 1708) reached perhaps {{convert|10.9|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length,&lt;ref name=MMDML03/&gt; and its single species has sometimes been included in the genus ''Allosaurus'' as ''Allosaurus maximus'', though recent studies support it as a separate genus.&lt;ref name=DJC00&gt;{{cite book|last=Chure|first=Daniel J.|year=2000 |title=A new species of ''Allosaurus'' from the Morrison Formation of Dinosaur National Monument (Utah–Colorado) and a revision of the theropod family Allosauridae |series=Ph.D. dissertation |publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another potential [[Specimens of Allosaurus|specimen of ''Allosaurus'']], once assigned to the genus ''[[Epanterias]]'' (AMNH 5767), may have measured {{convert|12.1|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in length.&lt;ref name=MMDML03/&gt; A more recent discovery is a partial skeleton from the Peterson Quarry in Morrison rocks of [[New Mexico]]; this large allosaurid may be another individual of ''Saurophaganax''.&lt;ref name=JF07b&gt;Foster, John. 2007.

===Skull===
[[File:Allosaurus skull Science World.jpg|thumb|right|Skull, at [[Telus World of Science, Vancouver]]]]
The skull and teeth of ''Allosaurus'' were modestly proportioned for a theropod of its size. Paleontologist [[Gregory S. Paul]] gives a length of {{convert|845|mm|in|abbr=on}} for a skull belonging to an individual he estimates at {{convert|7.9|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name=GSP88&gt;{{cite book|last=Paul|first=Gregory S.|title=Predatory Dinosaurs of the World |year=1988 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0-671-61946-6 |chapter=Genus ''Allosaurus'' |pages=307–313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each [[premaxilla]] (the bones that formed the tip of the snout), held five teeth with D-shaped cross-sections, and each [[maxilla]] (the main tooth-bearing bones in the upper jaw) had between 14 and 17 teeth; the number of teeth does not exactly correspond to the size of the bone. Each [[dentary]] (the tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw) had between 14 and 17 teeth, with an average count of 16. The teeth became shorter, narrower, and more curved toward the back of the skull. All of the teeth had saw-like edges. They were shed easily, and were replaced continually, making them common fossils.&lt;ref name=JM76/&gt;

The skull had a pair of [[horn (anatomy)|horns]] above and in front of the eyes. These horns were composed of extensions of the [[lacrimal bone]]s,&lt;ref name=JM76/&gt; and varied in shape and size. There were also lower paired ridges running along the top edges of the [[nasal bone]]s that led into the horns.&lt;ref name=JM76/&gt; The horns were probably covered in a [[keratin]] sheath and may have had a variety of functions, including acting as sunshades for the eye,&lt;ref name=JM76/&gt; being used for display, and being used in combat against other members of the same species&lt;ref name=GSP88/&gt;&lt;ref name=REM77&gt;{{cite journal |last=Molnar |first=Ralph E. |authorlink=Ralph Molnar |year=1977 |title=Analogies in the evolution of combat and display structures in ornithopods and ungulates |journal=Evolutionary Theory |volume=3 |pages=165–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although they were fragile).&lt;ref name=JM76/&gt; There was a ridge along the back of the skull roof for muscle attachment, as is also seen in [[tyrannosauridae|tyrannosaurids]].&lt;ref name=GSP88/&gt;

Inside the lacrimal bones were depressions that may have held [[gland]]s, such as [[salt gland]]s.&lt;ref name=DBN85&gt;{{cite book |last=Norman |first=David B. |authorlink=David B.

The roof of the braincase was thin, perhaps to improve [[thermoregulation]] for the [[brain]].&lt;ref name=JM76/&gt; The skull and lower jaws had joints that permitted motion within these units. In the lower jaws, the bones of the front and back halves loosely articulated, permitting the jaws to bow outward and increasing the animal's gape.&lt;ref name=GSP88e&gt;Paul, Gregory S. (1988). ''Predatory Dinosaurs of the World''. 91 and Figure 4–5 (93).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[braincase]] and [[frontal bone|frontals]] may also have had a joint.&lt;ref name=JM76/&gt;

===Postcranial skeleton===
[[File:Allosaurus Revised.jpg|thumb|left|Life restoration of ''A. fragilis'']]
''Allosaurus'' had nine [[vertebra]]e in the neck, 14 in the back, and five in the [[sacrum]] supporting the hips.&lt;ref&gt;Madsen, 1976; note that not everyone agrees on where the neck ends and the back begins, and some authors such as Gregory S. Paul interpret the count as ten neck and thirteen back vertebrae.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of tail vertebrae is unknown and varied with individual size; [[James Henry Madsen Jr.|James Madsen]] estimated about 50,&lt;ref name=JM76/&gt; while Gregory S. Paul considered that to be too many and suggested 45 or less.&lt;ref name=GSP88/&gt; There were hollow spaces in the neck and [[anatomical terms of location|anterior]] back vertebrae.&lt;ref name=JM76/&gt; Such spaces, which are also found in modern theropods (that is, the birds), are interpreted as having held [[Parabronchi|air sacs]] used in [[respiratory system|respiration]].&lt;ref name=HMC04&gt;{{cite book|last=Holtz |first=Thomas R., Jr. |authorlink=Thomas R.

Madsen noted that in about half of the individuals from the [[Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry]], independent of size, the pubes had not fused to each other at their foot ends. He suggested that this was a [[sexual dimorphism|sexual characteristic]], with females lacking fused bones to make egg-laying easier.&lt;ref name=JM76/&gt; This proposal has not attracted further attention, however.

==Classification==
''Allosaurus'' was an allosaurid, a member of a [[family (biology)|family]] of large theropods within the larger group [[Carnosauria]]. The family name [[Allosauridae]] was created for this genus in 1878 by [[Othniel Charles Marsh]],&lt;ref name=OCM78&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marsh |first=Othniel Charles |year=1878 |title=Notice of new dinosaurian reptiles |journal=American Journal of Science and Arts |volume=15 |pages=241–244 |doi=10.2475/ajs.s3-15.87.241}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the term was largely unused until the 1970s in favor of [[Megalosauridae]], another family of large theropods that eventually became a [[wastebasket taxon]]. This, along with the use of ''Antrodemus'' for ''Allosaurus'' during the same period, is a point that needs to be remembered when searching for information on ''Allosaurus'' in publications that predate James Madsen's 1976 monograph. Major publications using the name &quot;Megalosauridae&quot; instead of &quot;Allosauridae&quot; include [[Charles Gilmore|Gilmore]], 1920,&lt;ref name=CWG20/&gt; [[Friedrich von Huene|von Huene]], 1926,&lt;ref name=FvH26&gt;{{cite journal |last=von Huene |first=Friedrich |year=1926 |title=The carnivorous Saurischia in the Jura and Cretaceous formations, principally in Europe |journal=Revista del Museo de La Plata |volume=29 |pages=35–167}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Sherwood Romer|Romer]], 1956 and 1966,&lt;ref name=ASR56&gt;{{cite book |last=Romer |first=Alfred S. |year=1956 |title=Osteology of the Reptiles |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-89464-985-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ASR66&gt;{{cite book |last=Romer |first=Alfred S. |title= Vertebrate Paleontology |edition=Third |year=1966 |publisher= University of Chicago Press |location= Chicago |isbn=978-0-7167-1822-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steel, 1970,&lt;ref name=Steel70&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steel|first=R.|year= 1970|title=Part 14.

Following the publication of Madsen's influential monograph, Allosauridae became the preferred family assignment, but it too was not strongly defined. Semi-technical works used Allosauridae for a variety of large theropods, usually those that were larger and better-known than megalosaurids. Typical theropods that were thought to be related to ''Allosaurus'' included ''[[Indosaurus]]'', ''[[Piatnitzkysaurus]]'', ''[[Piveteausaurus]]'', ''[[Yangchuanosaurus]]'',&lt;ref name=DL83&gt;{{cite book |last=Lambert |first=David |author2=the Diagram Group |title=A Field Guide to Dinosaurs |year=1983 |publisher=Avon Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-380-83519-5 |chapter=Allosaurids |pages=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Acrocanthosaurus]]'', ''[[Chilantaisaurus]]'', ''[[Compsosuchus]]'', ''[[Stokesosaurus]]'', and ''[[Szechuanosaurus]]''.&lt;ref name=DL90&gt;{{cite book |last=Lambert |first=David |author2=the Diagram Group |title=The Dinosaur Data Book |year=1990 |publisher=Avon Books |location=New York |isbn=0-380-75896-2 |chapter=Allosaurids |page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given modern knowledge of theropod diversity and the advent of cladistic study of [[evolution]]ary relationships, none of these theropods is now recognized as an allosaurid, although several, like ''Acrocanthosaurus'' and ''Yangchuanosaurus'', are members of closely related families.&lt;ref name=HMC04/&gt;

===Early discoveries and research===
The discovery and early study of ''Allosaurus'' is complicated by the multiplicity of names coined during the [[Bone Wars]] of the late 19th century. The first described [[fossil]] in this history was a bone obtained secondhand by [[Ferdinand Vandiveer Hayden]] in 1869. It came from [[Middle Park (Colorado basin)|Middle Park]], near [[Granby, Colorado]], probably from [[Morrison Formation]] rocks. The locals had identified such bones as &quot;petrified [[horse]] hoofs&quot;. Hayden sent his specimen to [[Joseph Leidy]], who identified it as half of a tail vertebra, and tentatively assigned it to the European dinosaur genus ''[[Poekilopleuron]]'' as ''Poicilopleuron'' {{sic}} ''valens''.&lt;ref name=JL70&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leidy |first=Joseph |year=1870 |title=Remarks on ''Poicilopleuron valens'', ''Clidastes intermedius'', ''Leiodon proriger'', ''Baptemys wyomingensis'', and ''Emys stevensonianus'' |journal=Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia |volume=22 |pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later decided it deserved its own genus, ''Antrodemus''.&lt;ref name=JL73&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leidy |first=Joseph |year=1873 |title=Contribution to the extinct vertebrate fauna of the western territories |journal=Report of the U.S. Geological Survey of the Territories I |pages=14–358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Allosaurus'' itself is [[holotype|based on]] [[Peabody Museum of Natural History|YPM]] 1930, a small collection of fragmentary bones including parts of three vertebrae, a rib fragment, a tooth, a toe bone, and, most useful for later discussions, the shaft of the right humerus (upper arm). Othniel Charles Marsh gave these remains the formal name ''Allosaurus fragilis'' in 1877. ''Allosaurus'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''allos/αλλος'', meaning &quot;strange&quot; or &quot;different&quot; and ''sauros/σαυρος'', meaning &quot;lizard&quot; or &quot;reptile&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Liddell &amp; Scott|year=1980|title=Greek–English Lexicon, Abridged Edition |publisher=Oxford University Press| location=Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-910207-5|oclc=17396377}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named 'different lizard' because its vertebrae were different from those of other dinosaurs known at the time of its discovery.&lt;ref name=OCM77&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marsh |first=Othniel Charles |year=1877 |title=Notice of new dinosaurian reptiles from the Jurassic formation |journal=American Journal of Science and Arts |volume=14 |pages=514–516 |doi=10.2475/ajs.s3-14.84.514}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DMLomnipedia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dinosauria.com/dml/names/dinoa.htm |title=Dinosauria Translation and Pronunciation Guide A |accessdate=11 September 2007 |author=Creisler, Ben |date=7 July 2003 |publisher=Dinosauria On-Line |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mpuZDuPf?url=http://www.dinosauria.com/dml/names/dinoa.htm |archivedate=17 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The species epithet ''fragilis'' is [[Latin]] for &quot;fragile&quot;, referring to lightening features in the vertebrae. The bones were collected from the Morrison Formation of [[Garden Park, Colorado|Garden Park]], north of [[Cañon City, Colorado|Cañon City]].&lt;ref name=OCM77/&gt; Marsh and [[Edward Drinker Cope]], who were in scientific competition, went on to coin several other genera based on similarly sparse material that would later figure in the taxonomy of ''Allosaurus''. These include Marsh's ''Creosaurus''&lt;ref name=OCM78/&gt; and ''Labrosaurus'',&lt;ref name=OCM79&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marsh |first=Othniel Charles |year=1879 |title=Principal characters of American Jurassic dinosaurs.

In their haste, Cope and Marsh did not always follow up on their discoveries (or, more commonly, those made by their subordinates). For example, after the discovery by [[Benjamin Franklin Mudge|Benjamin Mudge]] of the type specimen of ''Allosaurus'' in Colorado, Marsh elected to concentrate work in [[Wyoming]]; when work resumed at Garden Park in 1883, M. P. Felch found an almost complete ''Allosaurus'' and several partial skeletons.&lt;ref name=DBN85/&gt; In addition, one of Cope's collectors, H. F. Hubbell, found a specimen in the [[Como Bluff]] area of Wyoming in 1879, but apparently did not mention its completeness, and Cope never unpacked it. Upon unpacking in 1903 (several years after Cope had died), it was found to be one of the most complete theropod specimens then known, and in 1908 the skeleton, now cataloged as AMNH 5753, was put on public view.&lt;ref name=NGD95&gt;{{cite book |last=Norell |first=Mark A. |author2=Gaffney, Eric S.|author3= Dingus, Lowell |title=Discovering Dinosaurs in the American Museum of Natural History |publisher=Knopf |location=New York |year=1995 |pages=112–113 |isbn=978-0-679-43386-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the well-known mount poised over a partial ''[[Apatosaurus]]'' skeleton as if [[scavenger|scavenging]] it, illustrated as such by Charles R. Knight. Although notable as the first free-standing mount of a theropod dinosaur, and often illustrated and photographed, it has never been scientifically described.&lt;ref name=BBetal99&gt;{{cite journal |last=Breithaupt |first=Brent H. |year=1999 |title=AMNH 5753: The world's first free-standing theropod skeleton |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=19 |issue=3, Suppl. |page=33A | doi = 10.1080/02724634.1999.10011202
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multiplicity of early names complicated later research, with the situation compounded by the terse descriptions provided by Marsh and Cope. Even at the time, authors such as [[Samuel Wendell Williston]] suggested that too many names had been coined.&lt;ref name=SWW78&gt;{{cite journal |last=Williston |first=Samuel Wendell |year=1878 |title=American Jurassic dinosaurs |journal=Transactions of the Kansas Academy of Science |volume=6 |pages=42–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Williston pointed out in 1901 that Marsh had never been able to adequately distinguish ''Allosaurus'' from ''Creosaurus''.&lt;ref name=SWW01&gt;{{cite journal |last=Williston |first=Samuel Wendell |year=1901 |title=The dinosaurian genus ''Creosaurus'', Marsh |journal=American Journal of Science|series=Series 4 |volume=11 |issue=62 |pages=111–114 |doi=10.2475/ajs.s4-11.62.111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most influential early attempt to sort out the convoluted situation was produced by [[Charles W. Gilmore]] in 1920. He came to the conclusion that the tail vertebra named ''Antrodemus'' by Leidy was indistinguishable from those of ''Allosaurus'', and ''Antrodemus'' thus should be the preferred name because as the older name it had priority.&lt;ref name=CWG20/&gt; ''Antrodemus'' became the accepted name for this familiar genus for over fifty years, until James Madsen published on the Cleveland-Lloyd specimens and concluded that ''Allosaurus'' should be used because ''Antrodemus'' was based on material with poor, if any, diagnostic features and locality information (for example, the [[geological formation]] that the single bone of ''Antrodemus'' came from is unknown).&lt;ref name=JM76/&gt; &quot;''Antrodemus''&quot; has been used informally for convenience when distinguishing between the skull Gilmore restored and the composite skull restored by Madsen.&lt;ref name=DH98&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henderson |first=Donald M. |year=1998 |title=Skull and tooth morphology as indicators of niche partitioning in sympatric Morrison Formation theropods |journal=Gaia |volume=15 |pages=219–266 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228687281_Skull_and_tooth_morphology_as_indicators_of_niche_partitioning_in_sympatric_Morrison_Formation_theropods |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cleveland-Lloyd discoveries===
[[File:Allosaurus atrox Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry.jpg|thumb|Specimen at the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry museum, Utah]]
Although sporadic work at what became known as the [[Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry]] in [[Emery County, Utah|Emery County]], [[Utah]] had taken place as early as 1927, and the fossil site itself described by [[William Lee Stokes|William L. Stokes]] in 1945,&lt;ref name=WJS45&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stokes |first=William L. |year=1945 |title=A new quarry for Jurassic dinosaurs |journal=Science |volume=101 |issue=2614 |pages=115–117 |doi=10.1126/science.101.2614.115-a |pmid=17799203|bibcode = 1945Sci...101..115S }}&lt;/ref&gt; major operations did not begin there until 1960. Under a cooperative effort involving nearly 40&amp;nbsp;institutions, thousands of bones were recovered between 1960 and 1965.&lt;ref name=JM76/&gt; The quarry is notable for the predominance of ''Allosaurus'' remains, the condition of the specimens, and the lack of scientific resolution on how it came to be. The majority of bones belong to the large theropod ''Allosaurus fragilis'' (it is estimated that the remains of at least 46&amp;nbsp;''A. fragilis'' have been found there, out of at minimum 73&amp;nbsp;dinosaurs), and the fossils found there are disarticulated and well-mixed. Nearly a dozen scientific papers have been written on the [[taphonomy]] of the site, suggesting numerous mutually exclusive explanations for how it may have formed. Suggestions have ranged from animals getting stuck in a bog, to becoming trapped in deep mud, to falling victim to [[drought]]-induced mortality around a waterhole, to getting trapped in a spring-fed pond or seep.&lt;ref name=APHetal06&gt;{{cite book |last=Hunt |first=Adrian P |author2=Lucas, Spencer G.|author3= Krainer, Karl|author4= Spielmann, Justin |year=2006 |chapter=The taphonomy of the [[Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry]], Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation, Utah: a re-evaluation |editor=Foster, John R. |editor2=Lucas, Spencer G. |title=Paleontology and Geology of the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation |series=New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin, '''36''' |publisher=New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science |location=Albuquerque, New Mexico |pages=57–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the actual cause, the great quantity of well-preserved ''Allosaurus'' remains has allowed this genus to be known in detail, making it among the best-known theropods.

''Allosaurus'' is regarded as senior synonym of the genera ''Creosaurus'', ''Epanterias'', and ''Labrosaurus''.&lt;ref name=HMC04/&gt; Most of the species that are regarded as synonyms of ''A. fragilis'', or that were misassigned to the genus, are obscure and were based on scrappy remains.

Other remains formerly thought to pertain to ''Allosaurus'' were described from [[Australia]],&lt;ref name=MFR81&gt;{{cite journal |last=Molnar |first=Ralph E. |year=1981 |title=An allosaurid theropod dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous of Victoria, Australia |journal=Alcheringa |volume=5 |pages=141–146 |doi=10.1080/03115518108565427 |last2=Flannery |first2=Timothy |last3=Rich |first3=Thomas |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Siberia]],&lt;ref name=ANNR14&gt;{{cite journal |last=Riabinin |first=Anatoly Nikolaenvich |year=1914 |title=Zamtka o dinozavry ise Zabaykalya |journal=Trudy Geologichyeskago Muszeyah Imeni Petra Velikago Imperatorskoy Academiy Nauk |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=133–140 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these fossils have been reassessed as belonging to other dinosaurs.

The issue of synonyms is complicated by the [[Type (biology)|type specimen]] of ''Allosaurus fragilis'' (catalog number [[Peabody Museum of Natural History|YPM]]&amp;nbsp;1930) being extremely fragmentary, consisting of a few incomplete vertebrae, limb bone fragments, rib fragments, and a tooth. Because of this, several scientists have interpreted the type specimen as potentially dubious, and thus the genus ''Allosaurus'' itself or at least the species ''A. fragilis'' would be a ''nomen dubium'' (&quot;dubious name&quot;, based on a specimen too incomplete to compare to other specimens or to classify). To address this situation, [[Gregory S. Paul]] and [[Kenneth Carpenter]] (2010) submitted a petition to the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]] to have the name &quot;''A. fragilis&quot;'' officially transferred to the more complete specimen USNM4734 (as a [[Hapantotype|neotype]]).

===Life history===
[[File:Fossil displays - Natural History Museum of Utah - DSC07215.JPG|thumb|left|Skeletons at different growth stages on display, [[Natural History Museum of Utah]]]]
The wealth of ''Allosaurus'' fossils, from nearly all ages of individuals, allows scientists to study how the animal grew and how long its lifespan may have been. Remains may reach as far back in the lifespan as [[egg (biology)|eggs]]—crushed eggs from Colorado have been suggested as those of ''Allosaurus''.&lt;ref name=DFG97/&gt; Based on [[Histology|histological]] analysis of limb bones, bone deposition appears to stop at around 22 to 28&amp;nbsp;years, which is comparable to that of other large theropods like ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. From the same analysis, its maximum growth appears to have been at age&amp;nbsp;15, with an estimated growth rate of about 150&amp;nbsp;kilograms (330&amp;nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]]) per year.&lt;ref name=PBetal06/&gt;

Medullary bone tissue (endosteally derived, ephemeral, mineralization located inside the medulla of the long bones in gravid female birds) has been reported in at least one ''Allosaurus'' specimen, a [[tibia|shin bone]] from the [[Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry|Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry]].&lt;ref name=LW08&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=Andrew H. |year=2008 |title=Sexual maturity in growing dinosaurs does not fit reptilian growth models |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=582–587 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0708903105 |pmid=18195356 |last2=Werning |first2=S |pmc=2206579|bibcode = 2008PNAS..105..582L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, this bone tissue is only formed in female birds that are laying eggs, as it is used to supply [[calcium]] to shells. Its presence in the ''Allosaurus'' individual has been used to establish sex and show it had reached reproductive age. However, other studies have called into question some cases of medullary bone in dinosaurs, including this ''Allosaurus'' individual. Data from extant birds suggested that the medullary bone in this ''Allosaurus'' individual may have been the result of a bone pathology instead.&lt;ref name=Chin09&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chinsamy | first1 = A. | last2 = Tumarkin-Deratzian | first2 = A. | year = 2009 | title = Pathological Bone Tissues in a Turkey Vulture and a Nonavian Dinosaur: Implications for Interpreting Endosteal Bone and Radial Fibrolamellar Bone in Fossil Dinosaurs | url = | journal = Anat.

[[File:Allosaurus Juvenile Reconstruction.jpg|thumb|Restoration of a juvenile]]
The discovery of a juvenile specimen with a nearly complete hindlimb shows that the legs were relatively longer in juveniles, and the lower segments of the leg (shin and foot) were relatively longer than the thigh. These differences suggest that younger ''Allosaurus'' were faster and had different hunting strategies than adults, perhaps chasing small prey as juveniles, then becoming ambush hunters of large prey upon adulthood.&lt;ref name=FC06/&gt; The thigh bone became thicker and wider during growth, and the cross-section less circular, as muscle attachments shifted, muscles became shorter, and the growth of the leg slowed. These changes imply that juvenile legs has less predictable stresses compared with adults, which would have moved with more regular forward progression.&lt;ref name=LCS02&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loewen |first=Mark A. |year=2002 |title=Ontogenetic changes in hindlimb musculature and function in the Late Jurassic theropod ''Allosaurus'' |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=22 |issue=3, Suppl. |page=80A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the skull bones appear to have generally grown [[allometry|isometrically]], increasing in size without changing in proportion.&lt;ref name=KC2010/&gt;

===Feeding===
[[File:Allosaurus attacks Stegosaurus.jpg|upright|thumb|left|''Allosaurus'' and ''Stegosaurus'' skeletons, [[Denver Museum of Nature and Science]]]]
Paleontologists accept ''Allosaurus'' as an active predator of large animals. There is dramatic evidence for allosaur attacks on ''Stegosaurus'', including an ''Allosaurus'' tail vertebra with a partially healed puncture wound that fits a ''Stegosaurus'' [[thagomizer|tail spike]], and a ''Stegosaurus'' neck plate with a U-shaped wound that correlates well with an ''Allosaurus'' snout.&lt;ref name=KSMW05&gt;{{cite book |first=Kenneth |last=Carpenter |author2=Sanders, Frank|author3= McWhinney, Lorrie A.|author4= Wood, Lowell |title=The Carnivorous Dinosaurs|year=2005 |chapter=Evidence for predator-prey relationships: Examples for ''Allosaurus'' and ''Stegosaurus'' |editor=Carpenter, Kenneth |pages=325–350 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington and Indianapolis |isbn= 978-0-253-34539-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sauropod]]s seem to be likely candidates as both live prey and as objects of [[scavenging]], based on the presence of scrapings on sauropod bones fitting allosaur teeth well and the presence of shed allosaur teeth with sauropod bones.&lt;ref name=FS04&gt;Fastovsky, David E.; and Smith, Joshua B. (2004). &quot;Dinosaur Paleoecology&quot;, in ''The Dinosauria'' (2nd). 614–626.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Gregory Paul noted in 1988, ''Allosaurus'' was probably not a predator of fully grown sauropods, unless it hunted in packs, as it had a modestly sized skull and relatively small teeth, and was greatly outweighed by contemporaneous sauropods.&lt;ref name=GSP88/&gt; Another possibility is that it preferred to hunt juveniles instead of fully grown adults.&lt;ref name=JF07/&gt;&lt;ref name=LG93/&gt; Research in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century may have found other solutions to this question. [[Robert T. Bakker]], comparing ''Allosaurus'' to [[Cenozoic]] sabre-toothed carnivorous mammals, found similar adaptations, such as a reduction of jaw muscles and increase in neck muscles, and the ability to open the jaws extremely wide. Although ''Allosaurus'' did not have sabre teeth, Bakker suggested another mode of attack that would have used such neck and jaw adaptations: the short teeth in effect became small serrations on a [[saw]]-like cutting edge running the length of the upper jaw, which would have been driven into prey. This type of jaw would permit slashing attacks against much larger prey, with the goal of weakening the victim.&lt;ref name=BB98/&gt;
[[File:Allosaurus Jaws Steveoc86.jpg|thumb|''Allosaurus'' attacking, based on the theories of [[Robert T. Bakker|Bakker]] (1998) and [[Emily Rayfield|Rayfield]] ''et al.'' (2001).]]
Similar conclusions were drawn by another study using [[finite element analysis]] on an ''Allosaurus'' skull. According to their biomechanical analysis, the skull was very strong but had a relatively small bite force. By using jaw muscles only, it could produce a bite force of 805 to 2,148&amp;nbsp;[[Newton (unit)|N]], less than the values for [[alligator]]s (13,000&amp;nbsp;N), [[lion]]s (4,167&amp;nbsp;N), and [[leopard]]s (2,268&amp;nbsp;N), but the skull could withstand nearly 55,500&amp;nbsp;N of vertical force against the tooth row. The authors suggested that ''Allosaurus'' used its skull like a hatchet against prey, attacking open-mouthed, slashing flesh with its teeth, and tearing it away without splintering bones, unlike ''Tyrannosaurus'', which is thought to have been capable of damaging bones. They also suggested that the architecture of the skull could have permitted the use of different strategies against different prey; the skull was light enough to allow attacks on smaller and more agile ornithopods, but strong enough for high-impact ambush attacks against larger prey like stegosaurids and sauropods.&lt;ref name=ERetal01/&gt; Their interpretations were challenged by other researchers, who found no modern analogues to a hatchet attack and considered it more likely that the skull was strong to compensate for its open construction when absorbing the stresses from struggling prey.&lt;ref name=FK02&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frazzetta |first=T. H. |year=2002 |title=Prey attack by a large theropod dinosaur |journal=Nature |volume=416 |pages=387–388 |doi=10.1038/416387a |pmid=11919619 |last2=Kardong |first2=K. V. |issue=6879|bibcode = 2002Natur.416..387F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original authors noted that ''Allosaurus'' itself has no modern equivalent, that the tooth row is well-suited to such an attack, and that articulations in the skull cited by their detractors as problematic actually helped protect the [[palate]] and lessen stress.&lt;ref name=ERetal02&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rayfield |first=Emily J. |year=2002 |title=Prey attack by a large theropod dinosaur: Response to Frazzetta and Kardong, 2002 |journal=Nature |volume=416 |page=388 |doi=10.1038/416388a |last2=Norman |first2=D. B. |last3=Upchurch |first3=P. |issue=6879|bibcode = 2002Natur.416..388R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility for handling large prey is that theropods like ''Allosaurus'' were &quot;flesh grazers&quot; which could take bites of flesh out of living sauropods that were sufficient to sustain the predator so it would not have needed to expend the effort to kill the prey outright. This strategy would also potentially have allowed the prey to recover and be fed upon in a similar way later.&lt;ref name=HMC04/&gt; An additional suggestion notes that ornithopods were the most common available dinosaurian prey, and that allosaurs may have subdued them by using an attack similar to that of modern big cats: grasping the prey with their forelimbs, and then making multiple bites on the throat to crush the trachea.&lt;ref name=JF07/&gt; This is compatible with other evidence that the forelimbs were strong and capable of restraining prey.&lt;ref name=KC02/&gt; Studies done by Stephen Lautenschager ''et al.'' from the University of Bristol also indicate ''Allosaurus'' could open its jaws quite wide and sustain considerable muscle force. When compared with ''Tyrannosaurus'' and the therizinosaurid ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'' in the same study, it was found that ''Allosaurus'' had a wider gape than either; the animal was capable of opening its jaws to a 79 degree angle. The findings also indicate that large carnivorous dinosaurs, like modern carnivores, had wider jaw gapes than herbivores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lautenschlager |first= Stephan |url=http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/2/11/150495 |title= Estimating cranial musculoskeletal constraints in theropod dinosaurs |work=The Royal Society |date=2015-11-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319215048/http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/2/11/150495 |archivedate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/11/151103213705.htm |title= Better to eat you with?

A [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] study published in 2013 by Eric Snively and colleagues found that ''Allosaurus'' had an unusually low attachment point on the skull for the [[longissimus capitis superficialis]] neck muscle compared to other theropods such as ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. This would have allowed the animal to make rapid and forceful vertical movements with the skull. The authors found that vertical strikes as proposed by Bakker and Rayfield are consistent with the animal's capabilities. They also found that the animal probably processed carcasses by vertical movements in a similar manner to [[falcon]]s, such as [[kestrel]]s: the animal could have gripped prey with the skull and feet, then pulled back and up to remove flesh. This differs from the prey-handling envisioned for tyrannosaurids, which probably tore flesh with lateral shakes of the skull, similar to crocodilians.&lt;ref name=ESetal2013&gt;{{cite journal |last=Snively |first=Eric. |author2=Cotton, John R.|author3= Ridgely, Ryan|author4= Witmer, Lawrence M. |year=2013 |title=Multibody dynamics model of head and neck function in ''Allosaurus'' (Dinosauria, Theropoda) |journal=Palaeontologica Electronica |volume=16 |issue=2 |url=http://palaeo-electronica.org/content/2013/389-allosaurus-feeding}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ''Allosaurus'' was able to &quot;move its head and neck around relatively rapidly and with considerable control&quot;, at the cost of power.&lt;ref name=Scidaily2013&gt;{{cite web|last=Ohio University|title=Allosaurus fed more like a falcon than a crocodile: Engineering, anatomy work reveals differences in dinosaur feeding styles|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/05/130521152638.htm|publisher=ScienceDaily|accessdate=22 May 2013|date=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Allosaurus skull front.jpg|thumb|upright|''A. fragilis'' skull cast in front view at the Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin]]
Other aspects of feeding include the eyes, arms, and legs. The shape of the skull of ''Allosaurus'' limited potential [[binocular vision]] to 20° of width, slightly less than that of modern [[crocodilia]]ns. As with crocodilians, this may have been enough to judge prey distance and time attacks.&lt;ref name=KAS06&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stevens |first=Kent A. |year=2006 |title=Binocular vision in theropod dinosaurs |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=321–330 |doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2006)26[321:BVITD]2.0.CO;2 |issn=0272-4634 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The arms, compared with those of other theropods, were suited for both grasping prey at a distance or clutching it close,&lt;ref name=KC02/&gt; and the articulation of the claws suggests that they could have been used to hook things.&lt;ref name=CWG20/&gt; Finally, the top speed of ''Allosaurus'' has been estimated at 30 to 55&amp;nbsp;kilometers per hour (19 to 34&amp;nbsp;miles per hour).&lt;ref name=PC98&gt;{{cite journal |last=Christiansen |first=Per |year=1998 |title=Strength indicator values of theropod long bones, with comments on limb proportions and cursorial potential |journal=Gaia |volume=15 |issue= |pages=241–255 |issn=0871-5424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new paper on the cranio-dental morphology of ''Allosaurus'' and how it worked has deemed the hatchet jaw attack unlikely, reinterpreting the unusually wide gape as an adaptation to allow Allosaurus to deliver a muscle-driven bite to large prey, with the weaker jaw muscles being a trade-off to allow for the widened gape.&lt;ref&gt;http://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/22490/1/102.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social behavior===
[[File:Labrosaurus.jpg|thumb|left|The holotype dentary of ''Labrosaurus ferox'', which may have been injured by the bite of another ''A. fragilis'']]
It has been speculated since the 1970s that ''Allosaurus'' preyed on sauropods and other large dinosaurs by hunting in groups.&lt;ref name=JF76&gt;{{cite journal |last=Farlow |first=James O. |year=1976 |title=Speculations about the diet and foraging behavior of large carnivorous dinosaurs |journal=American Midland Naturalist |volume=95 |issue=1 |pages=186–191 |doi=10.2307/2424244|jstor=2424244 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such a depiction is common in semitechnical and popular dinosaur literature.&lt;ref name=DBN85/&gt;&lt;ref name=DL83/&gt;&lt;ref name=LG93/&gt; Robert T. Bakker has extended social behavior to parental care, and has interpreted shed allosaur teeth and chewed bones of large prey animals as evidence that adult allosaurs brought food to lairs for their young to eat until they were grown, and prevented other carnivores from scavenging on the food.&lt;ref name=RTB97/&gt; However, there is actually little evidence of gregarious behavior in theropods,&lt;ref name=HMC04/&gt; and social interactions with members of the same species would have included antagonistic encounters, as shown by injuries to gastralia&lt;ref name=DJC00b/&gt; and bite wounds to skulls (the pathologic lower jaw named ''Labrosaurus ferox'' is one such possible example). Such head-biting may have been a way to establish dominance in a [[pack hunter|pack]] or to settle [[territory (animal)|territorial]] disputes.&lt;ref name=TC98&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tanke |first=Darren H. |authorlink=Darren Tanke |year=1998 |title=Head-biting behavior in theropod dinosaurs: Paleopathological evidence |journal=Gaia |issue=15 |pages=167–184 |url=http://www.academia.edu/2132861/Head-biting_behavior_in_theropod_dinosaurs_Paleopathological_evidence |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''Allosaurus'' may have hunted in packs,&lt;ref name=completedino&gt;{{cite book |title=The Complete Dinosaur |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FOViD-lDPy0C&amp;pg=PA228&amp;dq=Allosaurus+behavior |last=Currie |first=Philip J. |chapter=Theropods |editor=Farlow, James |editor2=Brett-Surman, M.K. |year=1999 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Indiana |isbn=978-0-253-21313-6 |page=228 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been argued that ''Allosaurus'' and other theropods had largely aggressive interactions instead of cooperative interactions with other members of their own species. The study in question noted that cooperative hunting of prey much larger than an individual predator, as is commonly inferred for theropod dinosaurs, is rare among [[vertebrate]]s in general, and modern [[diapsid]] carnivores (including lizards, crocodiles, and birds) rarely cooperate to hunt in such a way. Instead, they are typically territorial and will kill and [[cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalize]] intruders of the same species, and will also do the same to smaller individuals that attempt to eat before they do when aggregated at feeding sites. According to this interpretation, the accumulation of remains of multiple ''Allosaurus'' individuals at the same site, e.g. in the [[Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry|Cleveland–Lloyd Quarry]], are not due to pack hunting, but to the fact that ''Allosaurus'' individuals were drawn together to feed on other disabled or dead allosaurs, and were sometimes killed in the process. This could explain the high proportion of juvenile and subadult allosaurs present, as juveniles and subadults are disproportionally killed at modern group feeding sites of animals like [[crocodile]]s and [[Komodo dragon]]s. The same interpretation applies to Bakker's lair sites.&lt;ref name=RB07&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roach|first=Brian T. |year=2007 |title=A reevaluation of cooperative pack hunting and gregariousness in ''Deinonychus antirrhopus'' and other nonavian theropod dinosaurs|journal=Bulletin of the Peabody Museum of Natural History |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=103–138 |doi=10.3374/0079-032X(2007)48[103:AROCPH]2.0.CO;2|last2=Brinkman|first2=Daniel L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence for cannibalism in ''Allosaurus'', including ''Allosaurus'' shed teeth found among rib fragments, possible tooth marks on a [[scapula|shoulder blade]],&lt;ref name=BGD04&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goodchild Drake |first=Brandon |year=2004 |title=A new specimen of ''Allosaurus'' from north-central Wyoming |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=24 |issue=3, Suppl. |page=65A | doi = 10.1080/02724634.2004.10010643 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and cannibalized allosaur skeletons among the bones at Bakker's lair sites.&lt;ref name=BB04/&gt;

===Brain and senses===
The brain of ''Allosaurus'', as interpreted from spiral [[computed tomography|CT scanning]] of an [[endocranial cast|endocast]], was more consistent with [[crocodilia]]n brains than those of the other living [[archosaur]]s, birds. The structure of the [[vestibular system|vestibular apparatus]] indicates that the skull was held nearly horizontal, as opposed to strongly tipped up or down. The structure of the [[inner ear]] was like that of a crocodilian, and so ''Allosaurus'' probably could have heard lower frequencies best, and would have had trouble with subtle sounds. The [[olfactory bulb]]s were large and seem to have been well suited for detecting odors, although the area for evaluating smells was relatively small.&lt;ref name=SWR99/&gt;

===Paleopathology===
[[File:Allosaurus fragilis USNM4734.jpg|thumb|Mounted ''A. fragilis'' skeleton (USNM4734), which has several healed injuries]]
In 2001, Bruce Rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for [[stress fractures]] and [[tendon avulsions]] in [[theropod]] dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior. Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events they are more likely to be caused by the behavior of the animal than other kinds of injury. Stress fractures and tendon avulsions occurring in the forelimb have special behavioral significance since while injuries to the feet could be caused by running or [[animal migration|migration]], resistant prey items are the most probable source of injuries to the hand. ''Allosaurus'' was one of only two theropods examined in the study to exhibit a tendon avulsion, and in both cases the avulsion occurred on the forelimb. When the researchers looked for stress fractures, they found that ''Allosaurus'' had a significantly greater number of stress fractures than ''[[Albertosaurus]]'', ''[[Ornithomimus]]'' or ''[[Archaeornithomimus]]''. Of the 47 hand bones the researchers studied, 3 were found to contain stress fractures. Of the feet, 281 bones were studied and 17 found to have stress fractures. The stress fractures in the foot bones &quot;were distributed to the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] [[phalanges]]&quot; and occurred across all three weight-bearing toes in &quot;statistically indistinguishable&quot; numbers. Since the lower end of the third metatarsal would have contacted the ground first while an allosaur was running it would have borne the most stress. If the allosaurs' stress fractures were caused by damage accumulating while walking or running this bone should have experience more stress fractures than the others. The lack of such a bias in the examined ''Allosaurus'' fossils indicates an origin for the stress fractures from a source other than running. The authors conclude that these fractures occurred during interaction with prey, like an allosaur trying to hold struggling prey with its feet. The abundance of stress fractures and avulsion injuries in ''Allosaurus'' provide evidence for &quot;very active&quot; predation-based rather than scavenging diets.&lt;ref name=&quot;rothschild-dino&quot;&gt;Rothschild, B., Tanke, D. H., and Ford, T. L., 2001, Theropod stress fractures and tendon avulsions as a clue to activity: In: Mesozoic Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D. H., and Carpenter, K., Indiana University Press, p. 331-336.&lt;/ref&gt;

The left [[scapula]] and [[fibula]] of an ''[[Allosaurus fragilis]]'' specimen catalogued as USNM 4734 are both pathological, both probably due to healed fractures. The specimen USNM 8367 preserved several pathological gastralia which preserve evidence of healed fractures near their middle. Some of the fractures were poorly healed and &quot;formed pseudoarthroses.&quot; A specimen with a fractured rib was recovered from the [[Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry|Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry]]. Another specimen had fractured ribs and fused vertebrae near the end of the tail. An apparent subadult male ''[[Allosaurus fragilis]]'' was reported to have extensive pathologies, with a total of fourteen separate injuries. The specimen MOR 693 had pathologies on five ribs, the sixth neck vertebra the third eighth and thirteenth back vertebrae, the second tail vertebra and its chevron, the [[gastralia]] right scapula, manual phalanx I left [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]] metatarsals III and V, the first phalanx of the third toe and the third phalanx of the second. The ilium had &quot;a large hole... caused by a blow from above&quot;.The near end of the first phalanx of the third toe was afflicted by an [[involucrum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;molnar-pathology&quot; /&gt;

==Paleoecology==
[[File:Barosaurus lentus1.jpg|thumb|left|Restoration of ''[[Barosaurus]]'' rearing to defend itself against a pair of ''Allosaurus'']]
''Allosaurus'' was the most common large theropod in the vast tract of [[American West|Western American]] fossil-bearing rock known as the [[Morrison Formation]], accounting for 70 to 75% of theropod specimens,&lt;ref name=JF07/&gt; and as such was at the top [[trophic level]] of the Morrison [[food chain|food web]].&lt;ref name=JRF03a&gt;{{cite book |last=Foster |first=John R. |title=Paleoecological Analysis of the Vertebrate Fauna of the Morrison Formation (Upper Jurassic), Rocky Mountain Region, U.S.A. |year=2003 |series=New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin, '''23''' |publisher=New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science |location=Albuquerque, New Mexico |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a [[semiarid]] environment with distinct [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s, and flat [[floodplain]]s.&lt;ref name=DAR89&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Dale A. |authorlink=Dale Russell |title=An Odyssey in Time: Dinosaurs of North America |year=1989 |publisher=NorthWord Press |location=Minocqua, Wisconsin |isbn=978-1-55971-038-1 |pages=64–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetation varied from [[river]]-lining forests of [[conifer]]s, [[tree fern]]s, and [[fern]]s ([[gallery forest]]s), to fern [[savanna]]s with occasional trees such as the ''[[Araucaria]]''-like conifer ''[[Brachyphyllum]]''.&lt;ref name=KC06&gt;{{cite book |last=Carpenter |first=Kenneth |authorlink=Kenneth Carpenter |year=2006 |chapter=Biggest of the big: a critical re-evaluation of the mega-sauropod ''Amphicoelias fragillimus'' |editor=Foster, John R. |editor2=Lucas, Spencer G. |title=Paleontology and Geology of the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation |series=New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin, '''36''' |publisher=New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science |location=Albuquerque, New Mexico |pages=131–138 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Morrison Formation has been a rich fossil hunting ground. The flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of [[chlorophyta|green algae]], [[fungi]], [[moss]]es, [[equisetum|horsetails]], ferns, [[cycad]]s, [[ginkgo]]es, and several families of [[conifer]]s. Animal fossils discovered include [[bivalve]]s, [[snail]]s, [[actinopterygii|ray-finned fishes]], [[frog]]s, [[salamander]]s, [[turtle]]s, [[sphenodontia|sphenodonts]], [[lizard]]s, terrestrial and aquatic [[crocodylomorpha]]ns, several species of [[pterosaur]], numerous dinosaur species, and early [[mammal]]s such as [[docodonta|docodonts]], [[multituberculata|multituberculates]], [[symmetrodonta|symmetrodonts]], and [[triconodonta|triconodonts]]. Dinosaurs known from the Morrison include the theropods ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'', ''[[Ornitholestes]]'', ''[[Tanycolagreus]]'', and ''[[Torvosaurus]]'', the [[sauropod]]s ''[[Haplocanthosaurus]]'', ''[[Camarasaurus]]'', ''[[Cathetosaurus]]'', ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'', ''[[Suuwassea]]'', ''[[Apatosaurus]]'', ''[[Brontosaurus]]'', ''[[Barosaurus]]'', ''[[Diplodocus]]'', ''[[Supersaurus]]'', and ''[[Amphicoelias]]'', and the [[ornithischia]]ns ''[[Camptosaurus]]'', ''[[Dryosaurus]]'', and ''[[Stegosaurus]]''.&lt;ref name=DJCetal06&gt;{{cite book |last=Chure |first=Daniel J. |author2=Litwin, Ron|author3= Hasiotis, Stephen T.|author4= Evanoff, Emmett|author5= Carpenter, Kenneth |year=2006 |chapter=The fauna and flora of the Morrison Formation: 2006 |editor=Foster, John R. |editor2=Lucas, Spencer G. |title=Paleontology and Geology of the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation |series=New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin, '''36''' |publisher=New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science |location=Albuquerque, New Mexico |pages=233–248}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Allosaurus'' is commonly found at the same sites as ''Apatosaurus'', ''Camarasaurus'', ''Diplodocus'', and ''Stegosaurus''.&lt;ref name=DBBM80&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dodson |first=Peter |author2=Behrensmeyer, A.K.|author3= Bakker, Robert T.|author4= McIntosh, John S. |year=1980 |title=Taphonomy and paleoecology of the dinosaur beds of the Jurassic Morrison Formation |journal=Paleobiology |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=208–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Late Jurassic formations of Portugal where ''Allosaurus'' is present are interpreted as having been similar to the Morrison but with a stronger [[ocean|marine]] influence.

[[File:Alloquarrynolang.png|thumb|Locations in the [[Morrison Formation]] (yellow) where ''Allosaurus'' remains have been found]]
''Allosaurus'' coexisted with fellow large theropods ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'' and ''[[Torvosaurus]]'' in both the United States and Portugal.&lt;ref name=OM06/&gt; The three appear to have had different [[ecological niche]]s, based on anatomy and the location of fossils. Ceratosaurs and torvosaurs may have preferred to be active around waterways, and had lower, thinner bodies that would have given them an advantage in forest and underbrush terrains, whereas allosaurs were more compact, with longer legs, faster but less maneuverable, and seem to have preferred dry floodplains.&lt;ref name=BB04&gt;{{cite book |last=Bakker |first=Robert T. |author2=Bir, Gary |year=2004 |chapter=Dinosaur crime scene investigations: theropod behavior at Como Bluff, Wyoming, and the evolution of birdness |editor=Currie, Philip J. |editor2=Koppelhus, Eva B. |editor3=Shugar, Martin A. |editor4=Wright, Joanna L. |title=Feathered Dragons: Studies on the Transition from Dinosaurs to Birds |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington and Indianapolis |pages=301–342 |isbn=978-0-253-34373-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ceratosaurus'', better known than ''Torvosaurus'', differed noticeably from ''Allosaurus'' in functional anatomy by having a taller, narrower skull with large, broad teeth.&lt;ref name=DH98/&gt;&lt;!--if anyone finds the ref where ''Allosaurus'' was suggested as a female ''Ceratosaurus'', here's a good place to put it for irony--&gt; ''Allosaurus'' was itself a potential food item to other carnivores, as illustrated by an ''Allosaurus'' [[pubis (bone)|pubic foot]] marked by the teeth of another theropod, probably ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'' or ''[[Torvosaurus]]''.

==In popular culture==
Along with ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', ''Allosaurus'' has come to represent the quintessential large, carnivorous dinosaur in western popular culture. It is a common dinosaur in American museums, due in particular to the excavations at the [[Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry]]; by 1976, as a result of cooperative operations, 38&amp;nbsp;museums in eight countries on three continents had Cleveland-Lloyd allosaur material or casts.&lt;ref name=JM76/&gt; ''Allosaurus'' is the official [[state fossil]] of [[Utah]].&lt;ref name=statefossil&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pioneer.utah.gov/research/utah_symbols/fossil.html |title=Utah Symbols&amp;nbsp;– State Fossil |accessdate=16 June 2010 |publisher=Pioneer: Utah's Online Library, State of Utah |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mpuZdNJC?url=http://pioneer.utah.gov/research/utah_symbols/fossil.html |archivedate=17 January 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Allosaurus'' has been depicted in popular culture since the early years of the 20th century. It is top predator in both [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s 1912 novel, ''[[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]'', and its [[The Lost World (1925 film)|1925 film adaptation]], the first full-length motion picture to feature dinosaurs.&lt;ref&gt;Glut, Donald F.; Brett-Surman, Michael K. (1997). &quot;Dinosaurs and the media&quot;, in Farlow, James; and Brett-Surman, Michael K. (eds.): The Complete Dinosaur. Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 675–706. {{ISBN|978-0-253-33349-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Allosaurus'' was used as the starring dinosaur of the 1956 film ''[[The Beast of Hollow Mountain]]'',&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Lambert, ''Dinosaur Data Book'', p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1969 film ''[[The Valley of Gwangi]]'', two [[genre]] combinations of living dinosaurs with [[Western (genre)|Westerns]]. In ''The Valley of Gwangi'', Gwangi is billed as an ''Allosaurus'', although [[Ray Harryhausen]] based his model for the creature on Charles R. Knight's depiction of a ''Tyrannosaurus''. Harryhausen sometimes confuses the two, stating in a DVD interview &quot;They're both meat eaters, they're both tyrants... one was just a bit larger than the other.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Return to the Valley'', a documentary on the Region 1 ''Valley of Gwangi'' DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; A male individual also appears in ''[[The Land Before Time VI: The Secret of Saurus Rock]]'' as the main antagonist, bent on making a meal out of the main characters. It also appears in a flashback in the [[The Land Before Time (TV series)|2007 TV series]].

''Allosaurus'' appeared in the second episode of the 1999 [[BBC]] television series ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]'' and the follow-up special ''[[The Ballad of Big Al]]'', which speculated on the life of the &quot;Big Al&quot; specimen, based on scientific evidence from the numerous injuries and pathologies in its skeleton.&lt;ref name=benton2001&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benton | first1 = M.J. | year = 2001 | title = The science of 'Walking with Dinosaurs' | url = | journal = Teaching Earth Sciences | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 371–400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Allosaurus'' also made an appearance in the Discovery Channel series ''[[Dinosaur Revolution]]''. Its depiction in this series was based upon a specimen with a smashed lower jaw that was uncovered by paleontologist [[Thomas R. Holtz, Jr.|Thomas Holtz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marcot|first=Molly|title=Dr. Dinosaur|url=http://www.dbknews.com/archives/article_589bd770-e3b7-530e-9280-60d6d81a7571.html|accessdate=20 October 2011|newspaper=The Diamondback|date=6 September 2011|publisher=The University of Maryland|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427015730/http://www.dbknews.com/archives/article_589bd770-e3b7-530e-9280-60d6d81a7571.html|archivedate=27 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Allosaurus'' appears in the 2011 BBC docu-mini-series ''[[Planet Dinosaur]]'' in the episode &quot;Fight for Life&quot;.
