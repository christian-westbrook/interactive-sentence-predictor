&lt;!-- DEFINITIONS --&gt;
'''Artificial intelligence''' ('''AI''', also '''machine intelligence''', '''MI''') is apparently [[Intelligence|intelligent]] behaviour by [[machine]]s, rather than the ''natural intelligence'' (''NI'') of humans and other animals. In [[computer science]]  AI research is defined as the study of &quot;[[intelligent agent]]s&quot;: any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intelligent agents&quot;/&gt;  Colloquially, the term &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; is applied when a machine mimics &quot;cognitive&quot; functions that humans associate with other [[human mind]]s, such as &quot;learning&quot; and &quot;problem solving&quot;.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2009|p=2}}

The scope of AI is disputed: as machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered as requiring &quot;intelligence&quot; are often removed from the definition, a phenomenon known as the [[AI effect]], leading to the quip &quot;AI is whatever hasn't been done yet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hofstadter|1980|p=601}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[optical character recognition]] is frequently excluded from &quot;artificial intelligence&quot;, having become a routine technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Schank |first=Roger C. |title=Where's the AI |magazine=AI magazine |volume=12 |issue=4 |year=1991|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capabilities generally classified as AI {{as of|2017|lc=yes}} include successfully [[natural language understanding|understanding human speech]],{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2009}} competing at a high level in [[strategic game]] systems (such as [[chess]] and [[Go (game)|Go]]&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc-alphago&quot;/&gt;), [[autonomous car]]s, intelligent routing in [[content delivery network]]s, military simulations, and interpreting complex data.

&lt;!-- SUMMARIZING HISTORY --&gt;
Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism,&lt;ref name=&quot;Optimism of early AI&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AI in the 80s&quot;/&gt; followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an &quot;[[AI winter]]&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;First AI winter&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Second AI winter&quot;/&gt; followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.&lt;ref name=&quot;success in 21st century&quot;/&gt; For most of its history, AI research has been divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fragmentation of AI&quot;/&gt; However, in the early 21st century [[#Statistical|statistical approaches]] to [[machine learning]] became successful enough to eclipse all other tools, approaches, problems and schools of thought.&lt;ref name=&quot;success in 21st century&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!-- SUMMARIZING PROBLEMS, APPROACHES, TOOLS --&gt;
The traditional problems (or goals) of AI research include [[reason]]ing, [[knowledge]], [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]], [[learning]], [[natural language processing]], [[perception]] and the ability to move and manipulate objects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Problems of AI&quot;/&gt; [[artificial general intelligence|General intelligence]] is among the field's long-term goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;General intelligence&quot;/&gt; Approaches include [[#Statistical|statistical methods]], [[#Sub-symbolic|computational intelligence]], and [[#Symbolic|traditional symbolic AI]]. Many tools are used in AI, including versions of [[#Search and optimization|search and mathematical optimization]], [[#Neural networks|neural networks]] and [[#Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning|methods based on statistics, probability and economics]]. The AI field draws upon [[computer science]], [[mathematics]], [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[neuroscience]], [[artificial psychology]] and many others.

&lt;!-- SUMMARISING FICTION/SPECULATION, PHILOSOPHY, HISTORY --&gt;
The field was founded on the claim that [[human intelligence]] &quot;can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Dartmouth Workshop|Dartmouth proposal]], under [[#Philosophy|Philosophy]], below.&lt;/ref&gt; This raises philosophical arguments about the nature of the [[mind]] and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence, issues which have been explored by [[History of AI#AI in myth, fiction and speculation|myth]], [[artificial intelligence in fiction|fiction]] and [[philosophy of AI|philosophy]] since [[ancient history|antiquity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McCorduck's thesis&quot;/&gt;  Some people also consider AI a danger to humanity if it progresses unabatedly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://betanews.com/2016/10/21/artificial-intelligence-stephen-hawking/|title=Stephen Hawking believes AI could be mankind's last accomplishment|date=21 October 2016|website=BetaNews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- SUMMARIZING APPLICATIONS, STATE OF THE ART --&gt;
In the twenty-first century, AI techniques have experienced a resurgence following concurrent advances in [[Computer performance|computer power]], large amounts of [[big data|data]], and theoretical understanding, and AI techniques have become an essential part of the [[technology industry]], helping to solve many challenging problems in computer science.&lt;ref name=&quot;AI widely used&quot; /&gt;

{{Main article|History of artificial intelligence|Timeline of artificial intelligence}}

&lt;!-- PRE-20TH CENTURY. MAYBE TO BE KEPT SHORT. --&gt;
While thought-capable [[artificial being]]s appeared as [[storytelling device]]s in antiquity,&lt;ref name=&quot;AI in myth&quot;/&gt; the idea of actually trying to build a machine to perform useful reasoning may have begun with [[Ramon Llull]] (c. 1300 CE). With his [[Calculus ratiocinator]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]] extended the concept of the [[calculating machine]] ([[Wilhelm Schickard]] engineered the first one around 1623), intending to perform operations on concepts rather than numbers.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2009|p=16}} Since the 19th century, artificial beings are common in fiction, as in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' or [[Karel Čapek]]'s ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]]''.&lt;!-- PLEASE DON'T ADD MORE EXAMPLES. THIS IS ENOUGH. SEE SECTION AT BOTTOM OF ARTICLE ON SPECULATION.--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AI in early science fiction&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!-- MAJOR INTELLECTUAL PRECURSORS: LOGIC, THEORY OF COMPUTATION, CYBERNETICS, INFORMATION THEORY, EARLY NEURAL NETS --&gt;
The study of mechanical or [[formal reasoning|&quot;formal&quot; reasoning]] began with [[philosopher]]s and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of mathematical logic led directly to  [[Alan Turing]]'s [[theory of computation]], which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;, could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction. This insight, that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning, is known as the [[Church–Turing thesis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Formal reasoning&quot;/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}} Along with concurrent discoveries in [[neurology]], [[information theory]] and [[cybernetic]]s, this led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain.&lt;ref name=&quot;AI's immediate precursors&quot;/&gt; The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was [[Warren McCullouch|McCullouch]] and [[Walter Pitts|Pitts]]' 1943 formal design for [[Turing-complete]] &quot;artificial neurons&quot;.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2009|p=16}}

&lt;!-- THE &quot;GOLDEN YEARS&quot; 1956-1974 --&gt;
The field of AI research was born at [[Dartmouth workshop|a workshop]] at [[Dartmouth College]] in 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dartmouth conference&quot;/&gt; Attendees [[Allen Newell]] ([[Carnegie Mellon University|CMU]]), [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] ([[Carnegie Mellon University|CMU]]), [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] ([[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]), [[Marvin Minsky]] ([[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]) and [[Arthur Samuel]] ([[IBM]]) became the founders and leaders of AI research.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hegemony of the Dartmouth conference attendees&quot;/&gt; They and their students produced programs that the press described as &quot;astonishing&quot;:{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=18|quote=it was astonishing whenever a computer did anything kind of smartish}} computers were winning at the game checkers, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golden years of AI&quot;/&gt; By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the [[DARPA|Department of Defense]]&lt;ref name=&quot;AI funding in the 60s&quot;/&gt; and laboratories had been established around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;AI in England&quot;/&gt; AI's founders were optimistic about the future: [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] predicted, &quot;machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do&quot;. [[Marvin Minsky]] agreed, writing, &quot;within a generation&amp;nbsp;... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Optimism of early AI&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!-- FIRST AI WINTER --&gt;
They failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks. Progress slowed and in 1974, in response to the criticism of [[Sir James Lighthill]]{{sfn|Lighthill|1973}} and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in AI. The next few years would later be called an &quot;[[AI winter]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;First AI winter&quot;/&gt; a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult.

&lt;!-- BOOM OF THE 1980s, SECOND AI WINTER --&gt;
In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of [[expert system]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Expert systems&quot;/&gt; a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985 the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's [[fifth generation computer]] project inspired the U.S and British governments to restore funding for academic research.&lt;ref name=&quot;AI in the 80s&quot;/&gt; However, beginning with the collapse of the [[Lisp Machine]] market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting hiatus began.&lt;ref name=&quot;Second AI winter&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!-- FORMAL METHODS RISING IN THE 90s --&gt;
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, AI began to be used for logistics, [[data mining]], [[medical diagnosis]] and other areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;AI widely used&quot;/&gt; The success was due to increasing computational power (see [[Moore's law]]), greater emphasis on solving specific problems, new ties between AI and other fields and a commitment by researchers to mathematical methods and scientific standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Formal methods in AI&quot;/&gt; [[IBM Deep Blue|Deep Blue]] became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, [[Garry Kasparov]] on 11 May 1997.{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|pp=480–483}}

&lt;!--DEEP LEARNING, BIG DATA &amp; MACHINE LEARNING IN THE 2010s --&gt;
Advanced statistical techniques (loosely known as [[deep learning]]), access to [[big data|large amounts of data]] and [[Moore's law|faster computers]] enabled advances in [[machine learning]] and perception.&lt;ref name=&quot;deep learning&quot;/&gt; By the mid 2010s, machine learning applications were used throughout the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;success in 21st century&quot;/&gt; In a ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' [[quiz show]] exhibition match, [[IBM]]'s [[question answering system]], [[Watson (artificial intelligence software)|Watson]], defeated the two greatest Jeopardy champions, [[Brad Rutter]] and [[Ken Jennings]], by a significant margin.{{sfn|Markoff|2011}} The [[Kinect]], which provides a 3D body–motion interface for the [[Xbox 360]] and the Xbox One use algorithms that emerged from lengthy AI research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-programmer.info/news/105-artificial-intelligence/2176-kinects-ai-breakthrough-explained.html|title=Kinect's AI breakthrough explained|author=Administrator|work=i-programmer.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; as do [[intelligent personal assistant]]s in [[smartphone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://readwrite.com/2013/01/15/virtual-personal-assistants-the-future-of-your-smartphone-infographic|title=Virtual Personal Assistants &amp; The Future Of Your Smartphone [Infographic]|date=15 January 2013|author=Rowinski, Dan|work=ReadWrite}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016, [[AlphaGo]] won 4 out of 5 games of [[Go (game)|Go]] in a match with Go champion [[Lee Sedol]], becoming the first [[Computer Go|computer Go-playing system]] to beat a professional Go player without [[Go handicaps|handicaps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc-alphago&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deepmind.com/alpha-go.html|title=AlphaGo - Google DeepMind|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Artificial intelligence: Google's AlphaGo beats Go master Lee Se-dol|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35785875|accessdate=1 October 2016|work=BBC News|date=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2017 [[Future of Go Summit]],  [[AlphaGo]]  won a [[AlphaGo versus Ke Jie|three-game match]] with [[Ke Jie]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/05/win-china-alphagos-designers-explore-new-ai/|title=After Win in China, AlphaGo’s Designers Explore New AI|date=2017-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; who at the time continuously held the world No. 1 ranking for two years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goratings.org/|title=World's Go Player Ratings|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=柯洁迎19岁生日 雄踞人类世界排名第一已两年|url=http://sports.sina.com.cn/go/2016-08-02/doc-ifxunyya3020238.shtml|language=Chinese|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This marked the completion of a significant milestone in the development of Artificial Intelligence as Go is an extremely complex game, more so than Chess.

According to [[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg's]] Jack Clark, 2015 was a landmark year for artificial intelligence, with the number of software projects that use AI within Google increased from a &quot;sporadic usage&quot; in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects. Clark also presents factual data indicating that error rates in image processing tasks have fallen significantly since 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; He attributes this to an increase in affordable [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]], due to a rise in cloud computing infrastructure and to an increase in research tools and datasets.
Other cited examples include Microsoft's development of a Skype system that can automatically translate from one language to another and Facebook's system that can describe images to blind people.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite web

== Goals ==
&lt;!--- This is linked to in the introduction to the article and to the &quot;AI research&quot; section --&gt;

The overall research goal of artificial intelligence is to create technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner. The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention.&lt;ref name=&quot;Problems of AI&quot;/&gt;

Erik Sandwell emphasizes planning and learning that is relevant and applicable to the given situation.&lt;ref&gt;Sandewall, Erik. &quot;The Goals of Artificial Intelligence Research – A Brief introduction&quot;. Knowledge Representation Framework Project – Linkoping University. N.p., 8 August 2010. 8 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Reasoning, problem solving ===
&lt;!-- This is linked to in the introduction --&gt;&lt;!-- SOLVED PROBLEMS --&gt;
Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reasoning&quot;/&gt; By the late 1980s and 1990s, AI research had developed methods for dealing with [[uncertainty|uncertain]] or incomplete information, employing concepts from [[probability]] and [[economics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Uncertain reasoning&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!-- TWO IMPORTANT UNSOLVED PROBLEMS --&gt;
For difficult problems, algorithms can require enormous computational resources&amp;mdash;most experience a &quot;[[combinatorial explosion]]&quot;: the amount of memory or computer time required becomes astronomical for problems of a certain size. The search for more efficient problem-solving algorithms is a high priority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intractability&quot;/&gt;

Human beings ordinarily use fast, intuitive judgments rather than step-by-step deduction that early AI research was able to model.&lt;ref name=&quot;Psychological evidence of sub-symbolic reasoning&quot;/&gt; AI has progressed using &quot;sub-symbolic&quot; problem solving: [[embodied agent]] approaches emphasize the importance of [[Sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor]] skills to higher reasoning; [[neural net]] research attempts to simulate the structures inside the brain that give rise to this skill; [[#Statistical|statistical approaches to AI]] mimic the human ability to guess.

=== Knowledge representation ===
&lt;!-- This is linked to in the introduction --&gt;
[[File:GFO taxonomy tree.png|right|thumb|An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.]]
{{Main article|Knowledge representation|Commonsense knowledge}}

[[Knowledge representation]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Knowledge representation&quot;/&gt; and [[knowledge engineering]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Knowledge engineering&quot;/&gt; are central to AI research. Many of the problems machines are expected to solve will require extensive knowledge about the world. Among the things that AI needs to represent are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects;&lt;ref name=&quot;Representing categories and relations&quot;/&gt; situations, events, states and time;&lt;ref name=&quot;Representing time&quot;/&gt; causes and effects;&lt;ref name=&quot;Representing causation&quot;/&gt; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);&lt;ref name=&quot;Representing knowledge about knowledge&quot;/&gt; and many other, less well researched domains. A representation of &quot;what exists&quot; is an [[ontology (computer science)|ontology]]: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them. The [[semantics]] of these are captured as [[description logic]] concepts, roles, and individuals, and typically implemented as classes, properties, and individuals in the [[Web Ontology Language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sikos |first=Leslie F. |date=June 2017 |title=Description Logics in Multimedia Reasoning |url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319540658 |location=Cham |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-54066-5 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-54066-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most general ontologies are called [[upper ontology|upper ontologies]], which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge&lt;ref name=&quot;Ontology&quot;/&gt; by acting as mediators between [[Ontology (information science)#Domain ontology|domain ontologies]] that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern). Such formal knowledge representations are suitable for content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery via automated reasoning (inferring new statements based on explicitly stated knowledge), etc. Video events are often represented as [[Semantic Web Rule Language|SWRL]] rules, which can be used, among others, to automatically generate subtitles for constrained videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url= |title=Automatic annotation and semantic retrieval of video sequences using multimedia ontologies |last1=Bertini |first1=M |last2=Del Bimbo |first2=A |last3=Torniai |first3=C |date=2006 |publisher=ACM |book-title=MM ‘06 Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Multimedia |pages=679–682 |location=Santa Barbara |conference=14th ACM international conference on Multimedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are:
;[[Default reasoning]] and the [[qualification problem]]: Many of the things people know take the form of &quot;working assumptions&quot;. For example, if a bird comes up in conversation, people typically picture an animal that is fist sized, sings, and flies. None of these things are true about all birds. [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] identified this problem in 1969&lt;ref name=&quot;Qualification problem&quot;/&gt; as the qualification problem: for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of exceptions. Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires. AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Default reasoning and non-monotonic logic&quot;/&gt;
;The breadth of commonsense knowledge: The number of atomic facts that the average person knows is very large. Research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of [[commonsense knowledge]] (e.g., [[Cyc]]) require enormous amounts of laborious [[ontology engineering|ontological engineering]]—they must be built, by hand, one complicated concept at a time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Breadth of commonsense knowledge&quot;/&gt; A major goal is to have the computer understand enough concepts to be able to learn by reading from sources like the Internet, and thus be able to add to its own ontology.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}
;The subsymbolic form of some commonsense knowledge: Much of what people know is not represented as &quot;facts&quot; or &quot;statements&quot; that they could express verbally. For example, a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it &quot;feels too exposed&quot;{{sfn|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}} or an art critic can take one look at a statue and realize that it is a fake.{{sfn|Gladwell|2005}} These are non-conscious and sub-symbolic intuitions or tendencies in the human brain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intuition&quot;/&gt; Knowledge like this informs, supports and provides a context for symbolic, conscious knowledge. As with the related problem of sub-symbolic reasoning, it is hoped that [[situated artificial intelligence|situated AI]], [[computational intelligence]], or [[#Statistical|statistical AI]] will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intuition&quot;/&gt;

=== Planning ===
&lt;!-- This is linked to in the introduction --&gt;
[[File:Hierarchical-control-system.svg|thumb| A [[hierarchical control system]] is a form of [[control system]] in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a hierarchy.]]

{{Main article|Automated planning and scheduling}}

Intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Planning&quot;/&gt; They need a way to visualize the future—a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it—and be able to make choices that maximize the [[utility]] (or &quot;value&quot;) of available choices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Information value theory&quot;/&gt;

In classical planning problems, the agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world, allowing the agent to be certain of the consequences of its actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Classical planning&quot;/&gt; However, if the agent is not the only actor, then it requires that the agent can reason under uncertainty. This calls for an agent that cannot only assess its environment and make predictions, but also evaluate its predictions and adapt based on its assessment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Non-deterministic planning&quot;/&gt;

[[Multi-agent planning]] uses the [[cooperation]] and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal. [[Emergent behavior]] such as this is used by [[evolutionary algorithms]] and [[swarm intelligence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Multi-agent planning&quot;/&gt;

=== Learning ===
&lt;!-- This is linked to in the introduction --&gt;
{{Main article|Machine learning}}

Machine learning, a fundamental concept of AI research since the field's inception,&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Turing]] discussed the centrality of learning as early as 1950, in his classic paper &quot;[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]&quot;.{{Harv|Turing|1950}} In 1956, at the original Dartmouth AI summer conference, [[Ray Solomonoff]] wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning: &quot;An Inductive Inference Machine&quot;.{{Harv|Solomonoff|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.&lt;ref&gt;This is a form of [[Tom M. Mitchell|Tom Mitchell]]'s widely quoted definition of machine learning: &quot;A computer program is set to learn from an experience ''E'' with respect to some task ''T'' and some performance measure ''P'' if its performance on ''T'' as measured by ''P'' improves with experience ''E''.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Machine learning&quot;/&gt;

[[Unsupervised learning]] is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input. [[Supervised learning]] includes both [[statistical classification|classification]] and numerical [[Regression analysis|regression]]. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in, after seeing a number of examples of things from several categories. Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change. In [[reinforcement learning]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Reinforcement learning&quot;/&gt; the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent uses this sequence of rewards and punishments to form a strategy for operating in its problem space. These three types of learning can be analyzed in terms of [[decision theory]], using concepts like [[utility (economics)|utility]]. The mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of [[theoretical computer science]] known as [[computational learning theory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Computational learning theory&quot;/&gt;

Within [[developmental robotics]], developmental learning approaches are elaborated upon to allow robots to accumulate repertoires of novel skills through autonomous self-exploration, social interaction with human teachers, and the use of guidance mechanisms (active learning, maturation, motor synergies, etc.).{{sfn|Weng|McClelland|Pentland|Sporns|2001}}{{sfn|Lungarella|Metta|Pfeifer|Sandini|2003}}{{sfn|Asada|Hosoda|Kuniyoshi|Ishiguro|2009}}{{sfn|Oudeyer|2010}}

=== Natural language processing ===
&lt;!-- This is linked to in the introduction --&gt;
[[File:ParseTree.svg|thumb| A [[parse tree]] represents the [[syntax|syntactic]] structure of a sentence according to some [[formal grammar]].]]
{{Main article|Natural language processing}}

[[Natural language processing]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Natural language processing&quot;/&gt; gives machines the ability to read and [[natural language understanding|understand]] human language. A sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable [[natural language user interface]]s and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources, such as newswire texts. Some straightforward applications of natural language processing include [[information retrieval]], [[text mining]], [[question answering]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/2475776/Versatile_question_answering_systems_seeing_in_synthesis &quot;Versatile question answering systems: seeing in synthesis&quot;], Mittal et al., IJIIDS, 5(2), 119-142, 2011
&lt;/ref&gt; and [[machine translation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Applications of natural language processing&quot;/&gt;

A common method of processing and extracting meaning from natural language is through semantic indexing. Although these indexes require a large volume of user input, it is expected that increases in processor speeds and decreases in data storage costs will result in greater efficiency.

=== Perception ===
&lt;!-- This is linked to in the introduction --&gt;
{{Main article|Machine perception|Computer vision|Speech recognition}}

[[Machine perception]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Machine perception&quot;/&gt; is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, [[tactile sensor]]s, sonar and others) to deduce aspects of the world. [[Computer vision]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Computer vision&quot;/&gt; is the ability to analyze visual input. A few selected subproblems are [[speech recognition]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Speech recognition&quot;/&gt; [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]] and [[object recognition]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Object recognition&quot;/&gt;

=== Motion and manipulation ===
&lt;!-- This is linked to in the introduction --&gt;
{{Main article|Robotics}}

The field of [[robotics]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Robotics&quot;/&gt; is closely related to AI. Intelligence is required for robots to handle tasks such as object manipulation&lt;ref name=&quot;Configuration space&quot;/&gt; and [[motion planning|navigation]], with sub-problems such as [[Robot localization|localization]], [[robotic mapping|mapping]], and [[motion planning]]. These systems require that an agent is able to: Be spatially cognizant of its surroundings, learn from and build a map of its environment, figure out how to get from one point in space to another, and execute that movement (which often involves compliant motion, a process where movement requires maintaining physical contact with an object).{{sfn|Tecuci|2012}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Robotic mapping&quot;/&gt;

{{Main article|Affective computing}}
[[File:Kismet robot at MIT Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Kismet (robot)|Kismet]], a robot with rudimentary social skills{{sfn|''Kismet''}}]]

Affective computing is the study and development of systems that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human [[Affect (psychology)|affects]].{{sfn|Thro|1993}}{{sfn|Edelson|1991}} It is an interdisciplinary field spanning [[computer sciences]], [[psychology]], and [[cognitive science]].{{sfn|Tao|Tan|2005}} While the origins of the field may be traced as far back as the early philosophical inquiries into [[Emotion#The James-Lange Theory|emotion]],{{sfn|James|1884}} the more modern branch of computer science originated with [[Rosalind Picard]]'s 1995 paper{{sfn|Picard|1995}} on &quot;affective computing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kleine-Cosack|2006}}: &quot;The introduction of emotion to computer science was done by Pickard (sic) who created the field of affective computing.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diamond|2003}}: &quot;Rosalind Picard, a genial MIT professor, is the field's godmother; her 1997 book, Affective Computing, triggered an explosion of interest in the emotional side of computers and their users.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; A motivation for the research is the ability to simulate [[empathy]], where the machine would be able to interpret human emotions and adapts its behavior to give an appropriate response to those emotions.

Emotion and social skills&lt;ref name=&quot;Emotion and affective computing&quot;/&gt; are important to an intelligent agent for two reasons. First, being able to predict the actions of others by understanding their motives and emotional states allow an agent to make better decisions. Concepts such as [[game theory]], [[decision theory]], necessitate that an agent be able to detect and model human emotions. Second, in an effort to facilitate [[human–computer interaction]], an intelligent machine may want to display emotions (even if it does not experience those emotions itself) to appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction.

=== Creativity ===
&lt;!-- This is linked to in the introduction --&gt;
{{Main article|Computational creativity}}

A sub-field of AI addresses [[creativity]] both theoretically (the philosophical psychological perspective) and practically (the specific implementation of systems that generate novel and useful outputs).

=== General intelligence ===
&lt;!-- This is linked to in the introduction --&gt;
{{Main article|Artificial general intelligence|AI-complete}}

Many researchers think that their work will eventually be incorporated into a machine with [[artificial general intelligence]], combining all the skills mentioned above and even exceeding human ability in most or all these areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;General intelligence&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=Jacob|title=Thinking Machines: The Search for Artificial Intelligence|journal=Distillations |date=2016|volume=2|issue=2|pages=14–23|url=https://www.chemheritage.org/distillations/magazine/thinking-machines-the-search-for-artificial-intelligence|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few believe that [[anthropomorphic]] features like [[artificial consciousness]] or an [[artificial brain]] may be required for such a project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Artificial consciousness&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brain simulation&quot;/&gt;

Many of the problems above also require that general intelligence be solved. For example, even specific straightforward tasks, like [[machine translation]], require that a machine read and write in both languages ([[#Natural language processing|NLP]]), follow the author's argument ([[#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|reason]]), know what is being talked about ([[#Knowledge representation|knowledge]]), and faithfully reproduce the author's original intent ([[#Social intelligence|social intelligence]]). A problem like machine translation is considered &quot;[[AI-complete]]&quot;, but all of these problems need to be solved simultaneously in order to reach human-level machine performance.

== Approaches ==
There is no established unifying theory or [[paradigm]] that guides AI research. Researchers disagree about many issues.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nils Nilsson (researcher)|Nils Nilsson]] writes: &quot;Simply put, there is wide disagreement in the field about what AI is all about&quot; {{Harv|Nilsson|1983|p=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these: should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying [[psychology]] or [[neurology]]? Or is [[human biology]] as irrelevant to AI research as bird biology is to [[aeronautical engineering]]?&lt;ref name=&quot;Biological intelligence vs. intelligence in general&quot;/&gt;
Can intelligent behavior be described using simple, elegant principles (such as [[logic]] or [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]])? Or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems?&lt;ref name=&quot;Neats vs. scruffies&quot;/&gt;
Can intelligence be reproduced using high-level symbols, similar to words and ideas? Or does it require &quot;sub-symbolic&quot; processing?&lt;ref name=&quot;Symbolic vs. sub-symbolic&quot;/&gt;
John Haugeland, who coined the term GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence), also proposed that AI should more properly be referred to as [[synthetic intelligence]],{{sfn|Haugeland|1985|p=255}} a term which has since been adopted by some non-GOFAI researchers.{{sfn|Law|1994}}{{sfn|Bach|2008}}

Stuart Shapiro divides AI research into three approaches, which he calls computational psychology, computational philosophy, and computer science. Computational psychology is used to make computer programs that mimic human behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;Shapiro, Stuart C. (1992), &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot;, in Stuart C. Shapiro (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence'', 2nd edition (New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons): 54-57. 4 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Computational philosophy, is used to develop an adaptive, free-flowing computer mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Implementing computer science serves the goal of creating computers that can perform tasks that only people could previously accomplish.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Together, the humanesque behavior, mind, and actions make up artificial intelligence.

=== Cybernetics and brain simulation ===
{{Main article|Cybernetics|Computational neuroscience}}
In the 1940s and 1950s, a number of researchers explored the connection between [[neurology]], [[information theory]], and [[cybernetics]]. Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as [[W. Grey Walter]]'s [[turtle (robot)|turtles]] and the [[Johns Hopkins Beast]]. Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at [[Princeton University]] and the [[Ratio Club]] in England.&lt;ref name=&quot;AI's immediate precursors&quot;/&gt; By 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s.

=== Symbolic ===
{{Main article|Symbolic AI}}
When access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation. The research was centered in three institutions: [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Stanford]] and [[MIT]], and each one developed its own style of research. [[John Haugeland]] named these approaches to AI &quot;good old fashioned AI&quot; or &quot;[[GOFAI]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GOFAI&quot;/&gt; During the 1960s, symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high-level thinking in small demonstration programs. Approaches based on [[cybernetics]] or [[neural network]]s were abandoned or pushed into the background.&lt;ref&gt;The most dramatic case of sub-symbolic AI being pushed into the background was the devastating critique of [[perceptron]]s by [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]] in 1969. See [[History of AI]], [[AI winter]], or [[Frank Rosenblatt]].&lt;/ref&gt;
Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with [[artificial general intelligence]] and considered this the goal of their field.

==== Cognitive simulation ====
Economist [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] and [[Allen Newell]] studied human problem-solving skills and attempted to formalize them, and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence, as well as [[cognitive science]], [[operations research]] and [[management science]]. Their research team used the results of [[psychology|psychological]] experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to solve problems. This tradition, centered at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] would eventually culminate in the development of the [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]] architecture in the middle 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;AI at CMU in the 60s&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Soar&quot;/&gt;

==== Logic-based ====
Unlike [[Allen Newell|Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon|Simon]], [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought, but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem solving, regardless of whether people used the same algorithms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biological intelligence vs. intelligence in general&quot;/&gt; His laboratory at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] ([[Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory|SAIL]]) focused on using formal [[logic]] to solve a wide variety of problems, including [[knowledge representation]], [[automated planning and scheduling|planning]] and [[machine learning|learning]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AI at Stanford in the 60s&quot;/&gt; Logic was also the focus of the work at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and elsewhere in Europe which led to the development of the programming language [[Prolog]] and the science of [[logic programming]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AI at Edinburgh and France in the 60s&quot;/&gt;

==== Anti-logic or scruffy ====
Researchers at [[MIT]] (such as [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]])&lt;ref name=&quot;AI at MIT in the 60s&quot;/&gt; found that solving difficult problems in [[computer vision|vision]] and [[natural language processing]] required ad-hoc solutions – they argued that there was no simple and general principle (like [[logic]]) that would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior. [[Roger Schank]] described their &quot;anti-logic&quot; approaches as &quot;[[Neats vs. scruffies|scruffy]]&quot; (as opposed to the &quot;[[neats vs. scruffies|neat]]&quot; paradigms at [[Carnegie Mellon University|CMU]] and [[Stanford]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Neats vs. scruffies&quot;/&gt; [[Commonsense knowledge bases]] (such as [[Doug Lenat]]'s [[Cyc]]) are an example of &quot;scruffy&quot; AI, since they must be built by hand, one complicated concept at a time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cyc&quot;/&gt;

==== Knowledge-based====
When computers with large memories became available around 1970, researchers from all three traditions began to build [[knowledge representation|knowledge]] into AI applications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knowledge revolution&quot;/&gt; This &quot;knowledge revolution&quot; led to the development and deployment of [[expert system]]s (introduced by [[Edward Feigenbaum]]), the first truly successful form of AI software.&lt;ref name=&quot;Expert systems&quot;/&gt; The knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple AI applications.

=== Sub-symbolic ===
By the 1980s progress in symbolic AI seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially [[machine perception|perception]], [[robotics]], [[machine learning|learning]] and [[pattern recognition]]. A number of researchers began to look into &quot;sub-symbolic&quot; approaches to specific AI problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Symbolic vs. sub-symbolic&quot;/&gt; Sub-symbolic methods manage to approach intelligence without specific representations of knowledge.

====  Embodied intelligence ====
This includes [[embodied agent|embodied]], [[situated]], [[behavior-based AI|behavior-based]], and [[nouvelle AI]]. Researchers from the related field of [[robotics]], such as [[Rodney Brooks]], rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Embodied AI&quot;/&gt; Their work revived the non-symbolic viewpoint of the early [[cybernetic]]s researchers of the 1950s and reintroduced the use of [[control theory]] in AI. This coincided with the development of the [[embodied mind thesis]] in the related field of [[cognitive science]]: the idea that aspects of the body (such as movement, perception and visualization) are required for higher intelligence.

==== Computational intelligence and soft computing====
Interest in [[neural networks]] and &quot;[[connectionism]]&quot; was revived by [[David Rumelhart]] and others in the middle of 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Revival of connectionism&quot;/&gt; Neural networks are an example of [[soft computing]] --- they are solutions to problems which cannot be solved with complete logical certainty, and where an approximate solution is often sufficient. Other [[soft computing]] approaches to AI include [[fuzzy system]]s, [[evolutionary computation]] and many statistical tools. The application of soft computing to AI is studied collectively by the emerging discipline of [[computational intelligence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Computational intelligence&quot;/&gt;

=== Statistical ===
In the 1990s, AI researchers developed sophisticated mathematical tools to solve specific subproblems. These tools are truly [[scientific method|scientific]], in the sense that their results are both measurable and verifiable, and they have been responsible for many of AI's recent successes. The shared mathematical language has also permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields (like [[mathematics]], economics or [[operations research]]). [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig]] describe this movement as nothing less than a &quot;revolution&quot; and &quot;the victory of the [[neats and scruffies|neats]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Formal methods in AI&quot;/&gt; Critics argue that these techniques (with few exceptions{{sfn|Hutter|2012}}) are too focused on particular problems and have failed to address the long-term goal of general intelligence.{{sfn|Langley|2011}} There is an ongoing debate about the relevance and validity of statistical approaches in AI, exemplified in part by exchanges between [[Peter Norvig]] and [[Noam Chomsky]].{{sfn|Katz|2012}}{{sfn|Norvig|2012}}

=== Integrating the approaches ===
;Intelligent agent paradigm: An [[intelligent agent]] is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success. The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems. More complicated agents include human beings and organizations of human beings (such as [[firm]]s). The paradigm gives researchers license to study isolated problems and find solutions that are both verifiable and useful, without agreeing on one single approach. An agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works – some agents are symbolic and logical, some are sub-symbolic [[neural network]]s and others may use new approaches. The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fields—such as [[decision theory]] and economics—that also use concepts of abstract agents. The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intelligent agents&quot;/&gt;

;[[Agent architecture]]s and [[cognitive architecture]]s: Researchers have designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting [[intelligent agents]] in a [[multi-agent system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Agent architectures&quot;/&gt; A system with both symbolic and sub-symbolic components is a [[hybrid intelligent system]], and the study of such systems is [[artificial intelligence systems integration]]. A [[hierarchical control system]] provides a bridge between sub-symbolic AI at its lowest, reactive levels and traditional symbolic AI at its highest levels, where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modelling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hierarchical control system&quot;/&gt; [[Rodney Brooks]]' [[subsumption architecture]] was an early proposal for such a hierarchical system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Subsumption architecture&quot;/&gt;
&lt;!--
This should also describe [[Soar (cognitive architecture)]] briefly.
---&gt;

== Tools ==
In the course of 60+ years of research, AI has developed a large number of tools to solve the most difficult problems in [[computer science]]. A few of the most general of these methods are discussed below.

=== Search and optimization ===

{{Main article|Search algorithm|Mathematical optimization|Evolutionary computation}}

Many problems in AI can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions:&lt;ref name=&quot;Search&quot;/&gt; [[#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|Reasoning]] can be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from [[premise]]s to [[Logical consequence|conclusions]], where each step is the application of an [[inference rule]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Logic as search&quot;/&gt; [[Automated planning and scheduling|Planning]] algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called [[means-ends analysis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Planning as search&quot;/&gt; [[Robotics]] algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use [[local search (optimization)|local searches]] in [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Configuration space&quot; /&gt; Many [[machine learning|learning]] algorithms use search algorithms based on [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]].

Simple exhaustive searches&lt;ref name=&quot;Uninformed search&quot;/&gt; are rarely sufficient for most real world problems: the [[search algorithm|search space]] (the number of places to search) quickly grows to [[Large numbers#Astronomically large numbers|astronomical numbers]]. The result is a search that is [[Computation time|too slow]] or never completes. The solution, for many problems, is to use &quot;[[heuristics]]&quot; or &quot;rules of thumb&quot; that eliminate choices that are unlikely to lead to the goal (called &quot;[[pruning (algorithm)|pruning]] the [[search tree]]&quot;). [[Heuristics]] supply the program with a &quot;best guess&quot; for the path on which the solution lies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Informed search&quot;/&gt; Heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size.{{sfn|Tecuci|2012}}

A very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind [[hill climbing]]: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are [[simulated annealing]], [[beam search]] and [[random optimization]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Optimization search&quot;/&gt;

[[Evolutionary computation]] uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, [[natural selection|selecting]] only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses). Forms of [[evolutionary computation]] include [[swarm intelligence]] algorithms (such as [[ant colony optimization|ant colony]] or [[particle swarm optimization]])&lt;ref name=&quot;Society based learning&quot;/&gt; and [[evolutionary algorithms]] (such as [[genetic algorithms]], [[gene expression programming]], and [[genetic programming]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Genetic programming&quot;/&gt;

=== Logic ===

{{Main article|Logic programming|Automated reasoning}}

[[Logic]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Logic&quot;/&gt; is used for knowledge representation and problem solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well. For example, the [[satplan]] algorithm uses logic for [[automated planning and scheduling|planning]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Satplan&quot;/&gt; and [[inductive logic programming]] is a method for [[machine learning|learning]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Symbolic learning techniques&quot;/&gt;

Several different forms of logic are used in AI research. [[Propositional logic|Propositional]] or [[sentential logic]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Propositional logic&quot;/&gt; is the logic of statements which can be true or false. [[First-order logic]]&lt;ref name=&quot;First-order logic&quot;/&gt; also allows the use of [[quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]] and [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]], and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other. [[Fuzzy logic]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Fuzzy logic&quot;/&gt; is a version of first-order logic which allows the truth of a statement to be represented as a value between 0 and 1, rather than simply True (1) or False (0). [[Fuzzy system]]s can be used for uncertain reasoning and have been widely used in modern industrial and consumer [[Pattern recognition|product control systems]]. [[Subjective logic]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Subjective logic&quot;/&gt; models uncertainty in a different and more explicit manner than fuzzy-logic: a given binomial opinion satisfies belief + disbelief + uncertainty = 1 within a [[Beta distribution]]. By this method, ignorance can be distinguished from probabilistic statements that an agent makes with high confidence.

[[Default logic]]s, [[non-monotonic logic]]s and [[circumscription (logic)|circumscription]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Default reasoning and non-monotonic logic&quot;/&gt; are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the [[qualification problem]]. Several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of [[knowledge representation|knowledge]], such as: [[description logic]]s;&lt;ref name=&quot;Representing categories and relations&quot;/&gt; [[situation calculus]], [[event calculus]] and [[fluent calculus]] (for representing events and time);&lt;ref name=&quot;Representing time&quot;/&gt; [[Causality#Causal calculus|causal calculus]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Representing causation&quot;/&gt; belief calculus;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Belief Calculus and Uncertain Reasoning&quot;, Yen-Teh Hsia&lt;/ref&gt; and [[modal logic]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Representing knowledge about knowledge&quot;/&gt;

=== Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning ===

{{Main article|Bayesian network|Hidden Markov model|Kalman filter|Decision theory|Utility theory}}

Many problems in AI (in reasoning, planning, learning, perception and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from [[probability]] theory and economics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stochastic methods for uncertain reasoning&quot;/&gt;

[[Bayesian network]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;Bayesian networks&quot;/&gt; are a very general tool that can be used for a large number of problems: reasoning (using the [[Bayesian inference]] algorithm),&lt;ref name=&quot;Bayesian inference&quot;/&gt; [[Machine learning|learning]] (using the [[expectation-maximization algorithm]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Bayesian learning&quot;/&gt; [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]] (using [[decision network]]s)&lt;ref name=&quot;Bayesian decision networks&quot;/&gt; and [[machine perception|perception]] (using [[dynamic Bayesian network]]s).&lt;ref name=&quot;Stochastic temporal models&quot;/&gt; Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping [[machine perception|perception]] systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., [[hidden Markov model]]s or [[Kalman filter]]s).&lt;ref name=&quot;Stochastic temporal models&quot;/&gt;

A key concept from the science of economics is &quot;[[utility]]&quot;: a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using [[decision theory]], [[decision analysis]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Decisions theory and analysis&quot;/&gt; and [[applied information economics|information value theory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Information value theory&quot;/&gt; These tools include models such as [[Markov decision process]]es,&lt;ref name=&quot;Markov decision process&quot;/&gt; dynamic [[decision network]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Stochastic temporal models&quot; /&gt; [[game theory]] and [[mechanism design]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Game theory and mechanism design&quot;/&gt;

=== Classifiers and statistical learning methods ===

{{Main article|Classifier (mathematics)|Statistical classification|Machine learning}}

The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (&quot;if shiny then diamond&quot;) and controllers (&quot;if shiny then pick up&quot;). Controllers do, however, also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems. [[Classifier (mathematics)|Classifiers]] are functions that use [[pattern matching]] to determine a closest match. They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI. These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class can be seen as a decision that has to be made. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Classifiers&quot;/&gt;

A classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and [[machine learning]] approaches. The most widely used classifiers are the [[Artificial neural network|neural network]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Neural networks&quot; /&gt;
[[kernel methods]] such as the [[support vector machine]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Kernel methods&quot;/&gt;
[[k-nearest neighbor algorithm]],&lt;ref name=&quot;K-nearest neighbor algorithm&quot;/&gt;
[[Gaussian mixture model]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaussian mixture model&quot;/&gt;
[[naive Bayes classifier]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Naive Bayes classifier&quot;/&gt;
and [[decision tree learning|decision tree]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Decision tree&quot;/&gt;
The performance of these classifiers have been compared over a wide range of tasks. Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified. There is no single classifier that works best on all given problems; this is also referred to as the &quot;[[No free lunch in search and optimization|no free lunch]]&quot; theorem. Determining a suitable classifier for a given problem is still more an art than science.&lt;ref name=&quot;Classifier performance&quot;/&gt;

=== Neural networks ===

{{Main article|Artificial neural network|Connectionism}}
[[File:Artificial neural network.svg|thumb|A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of [[neuron]]s in the [[human brain]].]]

Neural networks are modeled after the neurons in the human brain, where a trained algorithm determines an output response for input signals. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nielsen|first1=Michael|title=Neural Networks and Deep Learning|url=http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The study of non-learning [[artificial neural network]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;Neural networks&quot;/&gt; began in the decade before the field of AI research was founded, in the work of [[Walter Pitts]] and [[Warren McCullouch]]. [[Frank Rosenblatt]] invented the [[perceptron]], a learning network with a single layer, similar to the old concept of [[linear regression]]. Early pioneers also include [[Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko]], [[Teuvo Kohonen]], [[Stephen Grossberg]], [[Kunihiko Fukushima]], Christoph von der Malsburg, David Willshaw, [[Shun-Ichi Amari]], [[Bernard Widrow]], [[John Hopfield]], [[Eduardo R. Caianiello]], and others.

The main categories of networks are acyclic or [[feedforward neural network]]s (where the signal passes in only one direction) and [[recurrent neural network]]s (which allow feedback and short-term memories of previous input events). Among the most popular feedforward networks are [[perceptron]]s, [[multi-layer perceptron]]s and [[radial basis network]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feedforward neural networks&quot;/&gt; Neural networks can be applied to the problem of [[intelligent control]] (for robotics) or [[machine learning|learning]], using such techniques as [[Hebbian learning]], [[GMDH]] or [[competitive learning]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Learning in neural networks&quot;/&gt;

Today, neural networks are often trained by the [[backpropagation]] algorithm, which had been around since 1970 as the reverse mode of [[automatic differentiation]] published by [[Seppo Linnainmaa]],&lt;ref name=&quot;lin1970&quot;&gt;[[Seppo Linnainmaa]] (1970). The representation of the cumulative rounding error of an algorithm as a Taylor expansion of the local rounding errors. Master's Thesis (in Finnish), Univ. Helsinki, 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;grie2012&quot;&gt;Griewank, Andreas (2012). Who Invented the Reverse Mode of Differentiation?. Optimization Stories, Documenta Matematica, Extra Volume ISMP (2012), 389-400.&lt;/ref&gt; and was introduced to neural networks by [[Paul Werbos]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WERBOS1974&quot;&gt;[[Paul Werbos]], &quot;Beyond Regression: New Tools for Prediction and Analysis in the Behavioral Sciences&quot;, ''PhD thesis, Harvard University'', 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;werbos1982&quot;&gt;[[Paul Werbos]] (1982).

[http://werbos.com/Neural/SensitivityIFIPSeptember1981.pdf Online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Backpropagation&quot;/&gt;

[[Hierarchical temporal memory]] is an approach that models some of the structural and algorithmic properties of the [[neocortex]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hierarchical temporal memory&quot;/&gt;

=== Deep feedforward neural networks ===

{{Main article|Deep learning}}

[[Deep learning]] in [[artificial neural networks]] with many layers has transformed many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including [[computer vision]], [[speech recognition]], [[natural language processing]] and others.&lt;ref name=&quot;goodfellow2016&quot;&gt;Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville (2016).

In 2006, a publication by [[Geoffrey Hinton]] and Ruslan Salakhutdinov introduced another way of pre-training many-layered [[feedforward neural network]]s (FNNs) one layer at a time, treating each layer in turn as an [[unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] [[restricted Boltzmann machine]], then using [[supervised learning|supervised]] [[backpropagation]] for fine-tuning.{{sfn|Hinton|2007}} Similar to shallow artificial neural networks, deep neural networks can model complex non-linear relationships. Over the last few years, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units and a very large output layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Research|first1=AI|title=Deep Neural Networks for Acoustic Modeling in Speech Recognition|url=http://airesearch.com/ai-research-papers/deep-neural-networks-for-acoustic-modeling-in-speech-recognition/|website=airesearch.com|accessdate=23 October 2015|date=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deep learning often uses [[convolutional neural network]]s (CNNs), whose origins can be traced back to the [[Neocognitron]] introduced by [[Kunihiko Fukushima]] in 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;FUKU1980&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fukushima | first1 = K. | year = 1980 | title = Neocognitron: A self-organizing neural network model for a mechanism of pattern recognition unaffected by shift in position | url = | journal = Biological Cybernetics | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 193–202 | doi=10.1007/bf00344251 | pmid=7370364}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, [[Yann LeCun]] and colleagues applied [[backpropagation]] to such an architecture.

=== Deep recurrent neural networks ===

{{Main article|Recurrent neural networks}}

Early on, [[deep learning]] was also applied to sequence learning with [[recurrent neural networks]] (RNNs)&lt;ref name=&quot;Recurrent neural networks&quot;/&gt; which are general computers and can run arbitrary programs to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. The depth of an RNN is unlimited and depends on the length of its input sequence.&lt;ref name=&quot;schmidhuber2015&quot;/&gt; RNNs can be trained by [[gradient descent]]&lt;ref&gt;P. J. Werbos.

Numerous researchers now use variants of a deep learning recurrent NN called the [[long short-term memory]] (LSTM) network published by Hochreiter &amp; Schmidhuber in 1997.&lt;ref name=lstm&gt;[[Sepp Hochreiter|Hochreiter, Sepp]]; and [[Jürgen Schmidhuber|Schmidhuber, Jürgen]]; ''Long Short-Term Memory'', Neural Computation, 9(8):1735–1780, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; LSTM is often trained by Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;graves2006&quot;&gt;Alex Graves, Santiago Fernandez, Faustino Gomez, and [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] (2006).

=== Control theory ===

{{Main article|Intelligent control}}
[[Control theory]], the grandchild of [[cybernetics]], has many important applications, especially in [[robotics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Control theory&quot;/&gt;

=== Languages ===

{{Main article|List of programming languages for artificial intelligence}}

&lt;!-- Not sure where to put this in the article. I think it deserves no more weight than this single sentence. To be improved. --&gt;
AI researchers have developed several specialized languages for AI research, including [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Lisp&quot;/&gt;, [[Prolog]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Prolog&quot;/&gt;, [[Python (programming language)|Python]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Python&quot;/&gt;, and [[C++]]&lt;ref name=&quot;C++&quot;/&gt;.

=== Evaluating progress ===
{{Main article|Progress in artificial intelligence}}
In 1950, [[Alan Turing]] proposed a general procedure to test the intelligence of an agent now known as the [[Turing test]]. This procedure allows almost all the major problems of artificial intelligence to be tested. However, it is a very difficult challenge and at present all agents fail.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turing test&quot;/&gt;

Artificial intelligence can also be evaluated on specific problems such as small problems in chemistry, hand-writing recognition and game-playing. Such tests have been termed [[subject matter expert Turing test]]s. Smaller problems provide more achievable goals and there are an ever-increasing number of positive results.&lt;ref name=&quot;Subject matter expert Turing test&quot;/&gt;

For example, performance at [[draughts]] (i.e. checkers) is optimal,&lt;ref name=&quot;Game AI&quot;/&gt; performance at chess is high-human and nearing super-human (see [[Computer chess#Computers versus humans|computer chess:&amp;nbsp;computers versus human]]) and performance at many everyday tasks (such as recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into something) is sub-human.

A quite different approach measures machine intelligence through tests which are developed from ''mathematical'' definitions of intelligence. Examples of these kinds of tests start in the late nineties devising intelligence tests using notions from [[Kolmogorov complexity]] and [[data compression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mathematical definitions of intelligence&quot;/&gt; Two major advantages of mathematical definitions are their applicability to nonhuman intelligences and their absence of a requirement for human testers.

A derivative of the Turing test is the Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart ([[CAPTCHA]]). As the name implies, this helps to determine that a user is an actual person and not a computer posing as a human. In contrast to the standard Turing test, CAPTCHA administered by a machine and targeted to a human as opposed to being administered by a human and targeted to a machine. A computer asks a user to complete a simple test then generates a grade for that test. Computers are unable to solve the problem, so correct solutions are deemed to be the result of a person taking the test. A common type of CAPTCHA is the test that requires the typing of distorted letters, numbers or symbols that appear in an image undecipherable by a computer.{{sfn|O'Brien|Marakas|2011}}

{{Main article|Applications of artificial intelligence}}

AI is relevant to any intellectual task.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2009|p=1}} Modern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list here. Frequently, when a technique reaches mainstream use, it is no longer considered artificial intelligence; this phenomenon is described as the [[AI effect]].{{sfn|''CNN''|2006}}

High-profile examples of AI include autonomous vehicles (such as [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]] and [[self-driving cars]]), medical diagnosis, creating art (such as poetry), proving mathematical theorems, playing games (such as Chess or Go), search engines (such as [[Google search]]), online assistants (such as [[Siri]]), image recognition in photographs, spam filtering, prediction of judicial decisions&lt;ref name=&quot;ecthr2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author1=N.

=== Healthcare ===
[[File:Laproscopic Surgery Robot.jpg|thumb| A patient side surgical arm of [[Da Vinci Surgical System]]. [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Laproscopic_Surgery_Robot.jpg] ]]
Artificial intelligence is breaking into the healthcare industry by assisting doctors. According to Bloomberg Technology, Microsoft has developed AI to help doctors find the right treatments for cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Dina Bass | title=Microsoft Develops AI to Help Cancer Doctors Find the Right Treatments |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-20/microsoft-develops-ai-to-help-cancer-doctors-find-the-right-treatments| date=September 20, 2016 | publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;There is a great amount of research and drugs developed relating to cancer. In detail, there are more than 800 medicines and vaccines to treat cancer. This negatively affects the doctors, because there are too many options to choose from, making it more difficult to choose the right drugs for the patients. Microsoft is working on a project to develop a machine called &quot;Hanover&quot;. Its goal is to memorize all the papers necessary to cancer and help predict which combinations of drugs will be most effective for each patient. One project that is being worked on at the moment is fighting [[acute myeloid leukemia|myeloid leukemia]], a fatal cancer where the treatment has not improved in decades. Another study was reported to have found that artificial intelligence was as good as trained doctors in identifying skin cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-38717928|title=Artificial intelligence 'as good as cancer doctors'|last=Gallagher|first=James|date=2017-01-26|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study is using artificial intelligence to try and monitor multiple high-risk patients, and this is done by asking each patient numerous questions based on data acquired from live doctor to patient interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Remote monitoring of high-risk patients using artificial intelligence|date=Oct 18, 1994|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US5357427|inventor-last=Langen|inventor2-last=Katz|inventor3-last=Dempsey|inventor-first=Pauline A.|inventor2-first=Jeffrey S.|inventor3-first=Gayle|issue=US5357427 A|accessdate=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[CNN]], there was a recent study by surgeons at the Children's National Medical Center in Washington which successfully demonstrated surgery with an autonomous robot. The team supervised the robot while it performed soft-tissue surgery, stitching together a pig's bowel during open surgery, and doing so better than a human surgeon, the team claimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Senthilingam, Meera|title=Are Autonomous Robots Your next Surgeons?|work=CNN|publisher=Cable News Network|date=May 12, 2016|accessdate=December 4, 2016|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/12/health/robot-surgeon-bowel-operation/}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBM has created its own artificial intelligence computer, the [[IBM Watson]] which has beaten human intelligence in many level.

=== Automotive ===
Advancements in AI have contributed to the growth of the automotive industry through the creation and evolution of self-driving vehicles. As of 2016, there are over 30 companies utilizing AI into the creation of [[driverless cars]]. A few companies involved with AI include [[Tesla Motors|Tesla]], [[Google]], and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;33 Corporations Working On Autonomous Vehicles&quot;. CB Insights. N.p., 11 August 2016. 12 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many components contribute to the functioning of self-driving cars. These vehicles incorporate systems such as braking, lane changing, collision prevention, navigation and mapping. Together, these systems, as well as high performance computers are integrated into one complex vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;West, Darrell M. &quot;Moving forward: Self-driving vehicles in China, Europe, Japan, Korea, and the United States&quot;. Center for Technology Innovation at Brookings. N.p., September 2016. 12 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent developments in autonomous automobiles have made the innovation of self-driving trucks possible, though the they are still in the testing phase. The UK government has passed legislation to begin testing of self-driving truck platoons in 2018. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burgess|first1=Matt|title=The UK is about to Start Testing Self-Driving Truck Platoons|url=http://www.wired.co.uk/article/uk-trial-self-driving-trucks-platoons-roads|website=WIRED|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-driving truck platoons are a fleet of self-driving trucks following the lead of one non-self-driving truck, so the truck platoons aren't entirely autonomous yet. Meanwhile, the Daimler, a German automobile corporation, is testing the Freightliner Inspiration which is a semi-autonomous truck that will only be used on the highway. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davies|first1=Alex|title=World's First Self-Driving Semi-Truck Hits the Road|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/05/worlds-first-self-driving-semi-truck-hits-road/|website=WIRED|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One main factor that influences the ability for a driver-less automobiles to function is mapping. In general, the vehicle would be pre-programmed with a map of the area being driven. This map would include data on the approximations of street light and curb heights in order for the vehicle to be aware of its surroundings. However, Google has been working on an algorithm with the purpose of eliminating the need for pre-programmed maps and instead, creating a device that would be able to adjust to a variety of new surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;McFarland, Matt. &quot;Google's artificial intelligence breakthrough may have a huge impact on self-driving cars and much more&quot;. ''The Washington Post'' 25 February 2015. Infotrac Newsstand. 24 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Some self-driving cars are not equipped with steering wheels or brakes, so there has also been research focused on creating an algorithm that is capable of maintaining a safe environment for the passengers in the vehicle through awareness of speed and driving conditions.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Programming safety into self-driving cars&quot;.

=== Finance ===
[[Financial institution]]s have long used [[artificial neural network]] systems to detect charges or claims outside of the norm, flagging these for human investigation. The use of AI in [[banking]] can be traced back to 1987 when [[Security Pacific National Bank]] in USA set-up a Fraud Prevention Task force to counter the unauthorised use of debit cards. Apps like Kasisito and Moneystream are using AI in financial services.

Banks use artificial intelligence systems today to organize operations, maintain book-keeping, invest in stocks, and manage properties. AI can react to changes overnight or when business is not taking place.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eleanor&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icas.com/ca-today-news/how-accountancy-and-finance-are-using-artificial-intelligence|title=Accounting, automation and AI|first=Eleanor|last=O'Neill,|website=www.icas.com|language=English|date=31 July 2016|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2001, robots beat humans in a simulated [[stock trader|financial trading]] competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1481339.stm Robots Beat Humans in Trading Battle.] BBC.com (August 8, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; AI has also reduced fraud and financial crimes by monitoring [[behavioral pattern]]s of users for any abnormal changes or anomalies.&lt;ref name=&quot;fsroundtable.org&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fsroundtable.org/cto-corner-artificial-intelligence-use-in-financial-services/|title=CTO Corner: Artificial Intelligence Use in Financial Services - Financial Services Roundtable|date=2015-04-02|newspaper=Financial Services Roundtable|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artificial intelligence is used to generate intelligent behaviors primarily in [[non-player character]]s (NPCs), often simulating human-like intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21721890-games-help-them-understand-reality-why-ai-researchers-video-games|title=Why AI researchers like video games|website=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Platforms ==
A [[platform (computing)|platform]] (or &quot;[[computing platform]]&quot;) is defined as &quot;some sort of hardware architecture or software framework (including application frameworks), that allows software to run&quot;. As Rodney Brooks pointed out many years ago,{{sfn|Brooks|1991}} it is not just the artificial intelligence software that defines the AI features of the platform, but rather the actual platform itself that affects the AI that results, i.e., there needs to be work in AI problems on real-world platforms rather than in isolation.

A wide variety of platforms has allowed different aspects of AI to develop, ranging from [[expert systems]] such as [[Cyc]] to [[Deep learning#Software libraries|deep-learning frameworks]] to robot platforms such as the [[Roomba]] with open interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hackingroomba.com/|title=Hacking Roomba|work=hackingroomba.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent advances in deep [[artificial neural network]]s and distributed computing have led to a proliferation of software libraries, including [[Deeplearning4j]], [[TensorFlow]], [[Theano (software)|Theano]] and [[Torch (machine learning)|Torch]].

Collective AI is a platform architecture that combines individual AI into a collective entity, in order to achieve global results from individual behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2014/08/self-organizing-thousand-robot-swarm|title=A self-organizing thousand-robot swarm|date=14 August 2014|website=www.seas.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vice.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/watch-an-autonomous-robot-swarm-form-2d-starfishes|title=Watch An Autonomous Robot Swarm Form 2D Starfishes|website=Creators}}&lt;/ref&gt; With its collective structure, developers can crowdsource information and extend the functionality of existing AI domains on the platform for their own use, as well as continue to create and share new domains and capabilities for the wider community and greater good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/02/08/theme-2-good-things-lie-ahead/|title=Theme 2: Good things lie ahead|first1=Lee|last1=Rainie|first2=|last2=Janna|first3=|last3=erson|date=8 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As developers continue to contribute, the overall platform grows more intelligent and is able to perform more requests, providing a scalable model for greater communal benefit.&lt;ref name=&quot;vice.com&quot;/&gt; Organizations like [[SoundHound]] Inc. and the [[Harvard John A.

=== Partnership on AI ===
Amazon, Google, Facebook, IBM, and Microsoft have established a non-profit partnership to formulate best practices on artificial intelligence technologies, advance the public's understanding, and to serve as a platform about artificial intelligence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;&quot;Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society&quot;. N.p., n.d. 24 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  They stated: &quot;This partnership on AI will conduct research, organize discussions, provide thought leadership, consult with relevant third parties, respond to questions from the public and media, and create educational material that advance the understanding of AI technologies including machine perception, learning, and automated reasoning.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Apple joined other tech companies as a founding member of the Partnership on AI in January 2017. The corporate members will make financial and research contributions to the group, while engaging with the scientific community to bring academics onto the board.&lt;ref&gt;Fiegerman, Seth. &quot;Facebook, Google, Amazon Create Group to Ease AI Concerns&quot;.

== Philosophy and ethics ==
{{Main article|Philosophy of artificial intelligence|Ethics of artificial intelligence}}
There are three philosophical questions related to AI:
# Is [[artificial general intelligence]] possible? Can a machine solve any problem that a human being can solve using intelligence? Or are there hard limits to what a machine can accomplish?
# Are intelligent machines dangerous? How can we ensure that machines behave ethically and that they are used ethically?
# Can a machine have a [[mind]], [[consciousness]] and [[philosophy of mind|mental states]] in exactly the same sense that human beings do? Can a machine be [[Sentience|sentient]], and thus deserve certain rights? Can a machine [[intention]]ally cause harm?

=== The limits of artificial general intelligence ===
{{Main article|philosophy of AI|Turing test|Physical symbol systems hypothesis|Dreyfus' critique of AI|The Emperor's New Mind|AI effect}}

Can a machine be intelligent? Can it &quot;think&quot;?

;''[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence|Alan Turing's &quot;polite convention&quot;]]'': We need not decide if a machine can &quot;think&quot;; we need only decide if a machine can act as intelligently as a human being. This approach to the philosophical problems associated with artificial intelligence forms the basis of the [[Turing test]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Turing test&quot;/&gt;

;''The [[Dartmouth Workshop|Dartmouth proposal]]'': &quot;Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.&quot; This conjecture was printed in the proposal for the Dartmouth Conference of 1956, and represents the position of most working AI researchers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dartmouth proposal&quot;/&gt;

;''[[Physical symbol system|Newell and Simon's physical symbol system hypothesis]]'': &quot;A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.&quot; Newell and Simon argue that intelligence consists of formal operations on symbols.&lt;ref name=&quot;Physical symbol system hypothesis&quot;/&gt; [[Hubert Dreyfus]] argued that, on the contrary, human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a &quot;feel&quot; for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. (See [[Dreyfus' critique of AI]].)&lt;ref&gt;
Dreyfus criticized the [[necessary and sufficient|necessary]] condition of the [[physical symbol system]] hypothesis, which he called the &quot;psychological assumption&quot;: &quot;The mind can be viewed as a device operating on bits of information according to formal rules.&quot; {{Harv|Dreyfus|1992|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dreyfus' critique&quot;/&gt;

;''Gödelian arguments'': [[Gödel]] himself,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gödel himself&quot;/&gt; [[John Lucas (philosopher)|John Lucas]] (in 1961) and [[Roger Penrose]] (in a more detailed argument from 1989 onwards) made highly technical arguments that human mathematicians can consistently see the truth of their own &quot;Gödel statements&quot; and therefore have computational abilities beyond that of mechanical Turing machines.&lt;ref name=&quot;The mathematical objection&quot;/&gt; However, the modern consensus in the scientific and mathematical community is that these &quot;Gödelian arguments&quot; fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Graham Oppy]]|title=Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/#GdeArgAgaMec|website=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|accessdate=27 April 2016|date=20 January 2015|quote=These Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments are, however, problematic, and there is wide consensus that they fail.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Stuart J. Russell]]|author2=[[Peter Norvig]]|title=[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]]|date=2010|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=0-13-604259-7|edition=3rd|chapter=26.1.2: Philosophical Foundations/Weak AI: Can Machines Act Intelligently?/The mathematical objection|quote=...even if we grant that computers have limitations on what they can prove, there is no evidence that humans are immune from those limitations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Colyvan. An introduction to the philosophy of mathematics. [[Cambridge University Press]], 2012. From 2.2.2, 'Philosophical significance of Gödel's incompleteness results': &quot;The accepted wisdom (with which I concur) is that the Lucas-Penrose arguments fail.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

;''The [[artificial brain]] argument'': The brain can be simulated by machines and because brains are intelligent, simulated brains must also be intelligent; thus machines can be intelligent. [[Hans Moravec]], [[Ray Kurzweil]] and others have argued that it is technologically feasible to copy the brain directly into hardware and software, and that such a simulation will be essentially identical to the original.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brain simulation&quot;/&gt;

;''The [[AI effect]]'': Machines are ''already'' intelligent, but observers have failed to recognize it. When [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] beat [[Garry Kasparov]] in chess, the machine was acting intelligently. However, onlookers commonly discount the behavior of an artificial intelligence program by arguing that it is not &quot;real&quot; intelligence after all; thus &quot;real&quot; intelligence is whatever intelligent behavior people can do that machines still cannot. This is known as the AI Effect: &quot;AI is whatever hasn't been done yet.&quot;&lt;!--&lt;ref name=&quot;AI Effect&quot;/&gt;--&gt;

=== Potential risks and moral reasoning ===

Widespread use of artificial intelligence could have unintended consequences that are dangerous or undesirable. Scientists from the [[Future of Life Institute]], among others, described some short-term research goals to be how AI influences the economy, the laws and ethics that are involved with AI and how to minimize AI security risks. In the long-term, the scientists have proposed to continue optimizing function while minimizing possible security risks that come along with new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Russel, Stuart., Daniel Dewey, and Max Tegmark. Research Priorities for Robust and Beneficial Artificial Intelligence. AI Magazine 36:4 (2015). 8 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. Research in this area includes &quot;machine ethics&quot;, &quot;artificial moral agents&quot;, and the study of &quot;malevolent vs. friendly AI&quot;.

==== Existential risk ====
{{Main article|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence}}
{{quote|text=The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.

A common concern about the development of artificial intelligence is the potential threat it could pose to mankind. This concern has recently gained attention after mentions by celebrities including [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Bill Gates]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Holley&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title = Bill Gates on dangers of artificial intelligence: 'I don't understand why some people are not concerned' |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/01/28/bill-gates-on-dangers-of-artificial-intelligence-dont-understand-why-some-people-are-not-concerned/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 28 January 2015|access-date = 2015-10-30|issn = 0190-8286|first = Peter|last = Holley}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elon Musk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Elon Musk: artificial intelligence is our biggest existential threat|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/27/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-ai-biggest-existential-threat|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-10-30|first = Samuel|last = Gibbs}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of prominent tech titans including [[Peter Thiel]], Amazon Web Services and Musk have committed $1billion to [[OpenAI]] a nonprofit company aimed at championing responsible AI development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/technology/ct-tech-titans-against-terminators-20151214-story.html|title=Tech titans like Elon Musk are spending $1 billion to save you from terminators|first=Washington|last=Post|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opinion of experts within the field of artificial intelligence is mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superhumanly-capable AI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In his book ''[[Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|Superintelligence]]'', [[Nick Bostrom]] provides an argument that artificial intelligence will pose a threat to mankind. He argues that sufficiently intelligent AI, if it chooses actions based on achieving some goal, will exhibit [[Instrumental convergence|convergent]] behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down. If this AI's goals do not reflect humanity's - one example is an AI told to compute as many digits of pi as possible - it might harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down, ultimately to better achieve its goal.

For this danger to be realized, the hypothetical AI would have to overpower or out-think all of humanity, which a minority of experts argue is a possibility far enough in the future to not be worth researching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is artificial intelligence really an existential threat to humanity?|url = http://thebulletin.org/artificial-intelligence-really-existential-threat-humanity8577|website = Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The case against killer robots, from a guy actually working on artificial intelligence|url = http://fusion.net/story/54583/the-case-against-killer-robots-from-a-guy-actually-building-ai/|website = Fusion.net|accessdate = 2016-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other counterarguments revolve around humans being either intrinsically or convergently valuable from the perspective of an artificial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Will artificial intelligence destroy humanity?

Concern over risk from artificial intelligence has led to some high-profile donations and investments. In January 2015, [[Elon Musk]] donated ten million dollars to the [[Future of Life Institute]] to fund research on understanding AI decision making. The goal of the institute is to &quot;grow wisdom with which we manage&quot; the growing power of technology. Musk also funds companies developing artificial intelligence such as [[Google DeepMind]] and [[Vicarious (company)|Vicarious]] to &quot;just keep an eye on what's going on with artificial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The mysterious artificial intelligence company Elon Musk invested in is developing game-changing smart computers|url = http://www.techinsider.io/mysterious-artificial-intelligence-company-elon-musk-investment-2015-10|website = Tech Insider|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; I think there is potentially a dangerous outcome there.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Musk-Backed Group Probes Risks Behind Artificial Intelligence|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-01/musk-backed-group-probes-risks-behind-artificial-intelligence|website = Bloomberg.com|accessdate = 2015-10-30|first = Jack|last = Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Elon Musk Is Donating $10M Of His Own Money To Artificial Intelligence Research|url = http://www.fastcompany.com/3041007/fast-feed/elon-musk-is-donating-10m-of-his-own-money-to-artificial-intelligence-research|website = Fast Company|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of militarized artificial intelligence is a related concern. Currently, 50+ countries are researching battlefield robots, including the United States, China, Russia, and the United Kingdom. Many people concerned about risk from superintelligent AI also want to limit the use of artificial soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates Warn About Artificial Intelligence|url = http://observer.com/2015/08/stephen-hawking-elon-musk-and-bill-gates-warn-about-artificial-intelligence/|website = Observer|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Devaluation of humanity ====
{{Main article|Computer Power and Human Reason}}
[[Joseph Weizenbaum]] wrote that AI applications cannot, by definition, successfully simulate genuine human empathy and that the use of AI technology in fields such as [[customer service]] or [[psychotherapy]]&lt;ref&gt;In the early 1970s, [[Kenneth Colby]] presented a version of Weizenbaum's [[ELIZA]] known as DOCTOR which he promoted as a serious therapeutic tool. {{Harv|Crevier|1993|pp=132–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; was deeply misguided. Weizenbaum was also bothered that AI researchers (and some philosophers) were willing to view the human mind as nothing more than a computer program (a position now known as [[computationalism]]). To Weizenbaum these points suggest that AI research devalues human life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weizenbaum's critique&quot;/&gt;

==== Decrease in demand for human labor ====
Martin Ford, author of ''The Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future'',{{sfn|Ford|2009|The lights in the tunnel}} and others argue that specialized artificial intelligence applications, robotics and other forms of automation will ultimately result in significant unemployment as machines begin to match and exceed the capability of workers to perform most routine and repetitive jobs. Ford predicts that many knowledge-based occupations—and in particular entry level jobs—will be increasingly susceptible to automation via expert systems, machine learning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econfuture.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/machine-learning-a-job-killer/|title=Machine Learning: A job killer?|work=econfuture - Robots, AI and Unemployment - Future Economics and Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other AI-enhanced applications. AI-based applications may also be used to amplify the capabilities of low-wage offshore workers, making it more feasible to [[Outsourcing|outsource]] [[knowledge worker|knowledge work]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Replaced by machines&quot;/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}}

==== Artificial moral agents ====
This raises the issue of how ethically the machine should behave towards both humans and other AI agents. This issue was addressed by Wendell Wallach in his book titled ''Moral Machines'' in which he introduced the concept of [[Moral agency#Artificial moral agents|artificial moral agents]] (AMA).&lt;ref&gt;Wendell Wallach (2010). ''Moral Machines'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For Wallach, AMAs have become a part of the research landscape of artificial intelligence as guided by its two central questions which he identifies as &quot;Does Humanity Want Computers Making Moral Decisions&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wallach, pp 37–54.&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Can (Ro)bots Really Be Moral&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wallach, pp 55–73.&lt;/ref&gt; For Wallach the question is not centered on the issue of ''whether'' machines can demonstrate the equivalent of moral behavior in contrast to the ''constraints'' which society may place on the development of AMAs.&lt;ref&gt;Wallach, Introduction chapter.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Machine ethics ====
{{Main article|Machine ethics}}
The field of machine ethics is concerned with giving machines ethical principles, or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter, enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision making.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Michael Anderson and Susan Leigh Anderson (2011), Machine Ethics, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The field was delineated in the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics: &quot;Past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings, with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines. In all cases, only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning. The time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines. Recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines, as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy, necessitate this. In contrast to computer hacking, software property issues, privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics, machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines. Research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems—it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence. Further, investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories, advancing our thinking about Ethics.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Fall/fs05-06 |title=Machine Ethics |work=aaai.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129044821/http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Fall/fs05-06 |archivedate=29 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality, computational ethics or computational morality. A variety of perspectives of this nascent field can be found in the collected edition &quot;Machine Ethics&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; that stems from the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

==== Malevolent and friendly AI ====
{{Main article|Friendly AI}}
Political scientist [[Charles T. Rubin]] believes that AI can be neither designed nor guaranteed to be benevolent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rubin |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles T. Rubin |date=Spring 2003 |title=Artificial Intelligence and Human Nature &amp;#124;`The New Atlantis |volume=1 |pages=88–100 |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/artificial-intelligence-and-human-nature |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611115223/http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/artificial-intelligence-and-human-nature |archivedate=11 June 2012 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that &quot;any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence.&quot; Humans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably, because there is no ''a priori'' reason to believe that they would be sympathetic to our system of morality, which has evolved along with our particular biology (which AIs would not share). Hyper-intelligent software may not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of mankind, and would be extremely difficult to stop. This topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth.

Physicist [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Microsoft]] founder [[Bill Gates]], and [[SpaceX]] founder [[Elon Musk]] have expressed concerns about the possibility that AI could evolve to the point that humans could not control it, with Hawking theorizing that this could &quot;[[Global catastrophic risk|spell the end of the human race]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|title=Microsoft's Bill Gates insists AI is a threat|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/31047780|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One proposal to deal with this is to ensure that the first generally intelligent AI is '[[Friendly AI]]', and will then be able to control subsequently developed AIs. Some question whether this kind of check could really remain in place.

Leading AI researcher [[Rodney Brooks]] writes, &quot;I think it is a mistake to be worrying about us developing malevolent AI anytime in the next few hundred years. I think the worry stems from a fundamental error in not distinguishing the difference between the very real recent advances in a particular aspect of AI, and the enormity and complexity of building sentient volitional intelligence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brooks|first=Rodney|title=artificial intelligence is a tool, not a threat|date=10 November 2014|url=http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/artificial-intelligence-tool-threat/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112130954/http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/artificial-intelligence-tool-threat/|archivedate=12 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Machine consciousness, sentience and mind ===
{{Main article|Artificial consciousness}}
If an AI system replicates all key aspects of human intelligence, will that system also be [[Sentience|sentient]] – will it have a [[mind]] which has [[consciousness|conscious experiences]]? This question is closely related to the philosophical problem as to the nature of human consciousness, generally referred to as the [[hard problem of consciousness]].

==== Consciousness ====
{{Main article|Hard problem of consciousness|Theory of mind}}
{{expand section|date=March 2016}}

==== Computationalism and functionalism ====
{{Main article|Computationalism|Functionalism (philosophy of mind)}}
Computationalism is the position in the [[philosophy of mind]] that the human mind or the human brain (or both) is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Horst|Horst, Steven]], (2005) [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/ &quot;The Computational Theory of Mind&quot;] in ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the [[mind-body problem]]. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers [[Jerry Fodor]] and [[Hilary Putnam]].

==== Strong AI hypothesis ====
{{Main article|Chinese room}}
The philosophical position that John Searle has named [[strong AI hypothesis|&quot;strong AI&quot;]] states: &quot;The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Searle's strong AI&quot;/&gt; Searle counters this assertion with his [[Chinese room]] argument, which asks us to look ''inside'' the computer and try to find where the &quot;mind&quot; might be.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinese room&quot;/&gt;

==== Robot rights ====
{{Main article|Robot rights}}
[[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' considers a key issue in the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]]: if a machine can be created that has intelligence, could it also ''[[sentience|feel]]''? If it can feel, does it have the same rights as a human? The idea also appears in modern science fiction, such as the film ''[[A.I.: Artificial Intelligence]]'', in which humanoid machines have the ability to feel emotions. This issue, now known as &quot;[[robot rights]]&quot;, is currently being considered by, for example, California's [[Institute for the Future]], although many critics believe that the discussion is premature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robot rights&quot;/&gt; Some critics of [[transhumanism]] argue that any hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with [[animal rights]] and human rights.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Evans 2015&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Evans | first = Woody | authorlink = Woody Evans | title = Posthuman Rights: Dimensions of Transhuman Worlds | work = Teknokultura | publisher = Universidad Complutense, Madrid | date = 2015 | url = http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/TEKN/article/view/49072/46310 | accessdate = December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject is profoundly discussed in the 2010 documentary film ''[[Plug &amp; Pray]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plugandpray-film.de/en/content.html|title=Content: Plug &amp; Pray Film - Artificial Intelligence - Robots - |author=maschafilm|work=plugandpray-film.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Superintelligence ===
{{Main article|Superintelligence}}
Are there limits to how intelligent machines&amp;nbsp;– or human-machine hybrids&amp;nbsp;– can be? A superintelligence, hyperintelligence, or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. ‘’Superintelligence’’ may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts&quot;/&gt;

==== Technological singularity ====
{{Main article|Technological singularity|Moore's law}}
If research into [[artificial general intelligence|Strong AI]] produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to [[Intelligence explosion|recursive self-improvement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;recurse&quot;/&gt; The new intelligence could thus increase exponentially and dramatically surpass humans. Science fiction writer [[Vernor Vinge]] named this scenario &quot;[[technological singularity|singularity]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Singularity/&gt; Technological singularity is when accelerating progress in technologies will cause a runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence will exceed human intellectual capacity and control, thus radically changing or even ending civilization. Because the capabilities of such an intelligence may be impossible to comprehend, the technological singularity is an occurrence beyond which events are unpredictable or even unfathomable.&lt;ref name=Singularity/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts&quot;/&gt;

[[Ray Kurzweil]] has used [[Moore's law]] (which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology) to calculate that [[desktop computer]]s will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029, and predicts that the singularity will occur in 2045.&lt;ref name=Singularity/&gt;

Robot designer [[Hans Moravec]], cyberneticist [[Kevin Warwick]] and inventor [[Ray Kurzweil]] have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into [[cyborg]]s that are more capable and powerful than either.&lt;ref name=&quot;Transhumanism&quot;/&gt; This idea, called [[transhumanism]], which has roots in [[Aldous Huxley]] and [[Robert Ettinger]], has been illustrated in fiction as well, for example in the [[manga]] ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' and the science-fiction series ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''.

In the 1980s artist [[Hajime Sorayama]]'s Sexy Robots series were painted and published in Japan depicting the actual organic human form with lifelike muscular metallic skins and later &quot;the Gynoids&quot; book followed that was used by or influenced movie makers including [[George Lucas]] and other creatives. Sorayama never considered these organic robots to be real part of nature but always unnatural product of the human mind, a fantasy existing in the mind even when realized in actual form.

[[Edward Fredkin]] argues that &quot;artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution&quot;, an idea first proposed by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s &quot;[[Darwin among the Machines]]&quot; (1863), and expanded upon by [[George Dyson (science historian)|George Dyson]] in his book of the same name in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;AI as evolution&quot;/&gt;

{{Main article|Artificial intelligence in fiction}}
&lt;!-- IMPACT ON SOCIETY: FICTION --&gt;
Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity.&lt;ref name=&quot;AI in myth&quot;/&gt;

The implications of a constructed machine exhibiting artificial intelligence have been a persistent theme in [[science fiction]] since the twentieth century. Early stories typically revolved around intelligent robots. The word &quot;robot&quot; itself was coined by [[Karel Čapek]] in his 1921 play ''[[R.U.R.]]'', the title standing for &quot;[[Rossum's Universal Robots]]&quot;. Later, the SF writer [[Isaac Asimov]] developed the [[Three Laws of Robotics]] which he subsequently explored in a long series of robot stories. Asimov's laws are often brought up during layman discussions of machine ethics;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Susan Leigh. &quot;Asimov’s &quot;three laws of robotics&quot; and machine metaethics.&quot; AI &amp; Society 22.4 (2008): 477-493.&lt;/ref&gt; while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCauley | first1 = Lee | year = 2007 | title = AI armageddon and the three laws of robotics | url = | journal = Ethics and Information Technology | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 153–164 | doi=10.1007/s10676-007-9138-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'', by [[Philip K. Dick]], tells a science fiction story about Androids and humans clashing in a futuristic world. Elements of artificial intelligence include the empathy box, mood organ, and the androids themselves. Throughout the novel, Dick portrays the idea that human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galvan|first=Jill|date=1997-01-01|title=Entering the Posthuman Collective in Philip K. Dick's &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;|journal=Science Fiction Studies|volume=24|issue=3|pages=413–429|jstor=4240644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays AI is firmly rooted in popular culture; intelligent robots appear in innumerable works. [[HAL 9000|HAL]], the murderous computer in charge of the spaceship in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968), is an example of the common &quot;robotic rampage&quot; archetype in science fiction movies. ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984) and ''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999) provide additional widely familiar examples. In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' (1951) and Bishop from ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buttazzo|first1=G.|title=Artificial consciousness: Utopia or real possibility? |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/933500/?reload=true |journal=[[Computer (magazine)|Computer (IEEE)]]|date=July 2001|volume=34|issue=7|pages=24–30|doi=10.1109/2.933500|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- INTRODUCTION ------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;

&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;Definition of AI&quot;&gt;--&gt;
Definition of AI as the study of [[intelligent agents]]:
* {{Harvnb|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|loc=[http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~poole/ci/ch1.pdf p. 1]}}, which provides the version that is used in this article. Note that they use the term &quot;computational intelligence&quot; as a synonym for artificial intelligence.
* {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003}} (who prefer the term &quot;rational agent&quot;) and write &quot;The whole-agent view is now widely accepted in the field&quot; {{Harv|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=55}}.
* {{Harvnb|Nilsson|1998}}
&lt;!--These textbooks are the most widely used in academic AI.--&gt;
* {{Harvnb|Legg|Hutter|2007}}.

&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;Coining of the term AI&quot;&gt;
Although there is some controversy on this point (see {{Harvtxt|Crevier|1993|p=50}}), [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|McCarthy]] states unequivocally &quot;I came up with the term&quot; in a c|net interview. {{Harv|Skillings|2006}} McCarthy first used the term in the proposal for the Dartmouth conference, which appeared in 1955. {{Harv|McCarthy|Minsky|Rochester|Shannon|1955}}
&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

* {{Harvnb|McCarthy|2007}}
&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

&lt;ref name=&quot;McCorduck's thesis&quot;&gt;
This is a central idea of [[Pamela McCorduck]]'s ''Machines Who Think''. She writes: &quot;I like to think of artificial intelligence as the scientific apotheosis of a venerable cultural tradition.&quot; {{Harv|McCorduck|2004|p=34}} &quot;Artificial intelligence in one form or another is an idea that has pervaded Western intellectual history, a dream in urgent need of being realized.&quot; {{Harv|McCorduck|2004|p=xviii}} &quot;Our history is full of attempts—nutty, eerie, comical, earnest, legendary and real—to make artificial intelligences, to reproduce what is the essential us—bypassing the ordinary means. Back and forth between myth and reality, our imaginations supplying what our workshops couldn't, we have engaged for a long time in this odd form of self-reproduction.&quot; {{Harv|McCorduck|2004|p=3}} She traces the desire back to its [[Hellenistic]] roots and calls it the urge to &quot;forge the Gods.&quot; {{Harv|McCorduck|2004|pp=340–400}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=&quot;Fragmentation of AI&quot;&gt;
Pamela {{Harvtxt|McCorduck|2004|pp=424}} writes of &quot;the rough shattering of AI in subfields—vision, natural language, decision theory, genetic algorithms, robotics&amp;nbsp;... and these with own sub-subfield—that would hardly have anything to say to each other.&quot;

&lt;!--not used&lt;ref name=&quot;Philosophy of AI&quot;&gt;
[[Philosophy of AI]]. All of these positions in this section are mentioned in standard discussions of the subject, such as:&lt;ref&gt;
* {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=947–960}}
* {{Harvnb|Fearn|2007|pp=38–55}}
&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=&quot;Gödel himself&quot;&gt;
{{Harvnb|Gödel|1951}}: in this lecture, [[Kurt Gödel]] uses the incompleteness theorem to arrive at the following disjunction: (a) the human mind is not a consistent finite machine, or (b) there exist [[Diophantine equations]] for which it cannot decide whether solutions exist. Gödel finds (b) implausible, and thus seems to have believed the human mind was not equivalent to a finite machine, i.e., its power exceeded that of any finite machine. He recognized that this was only a conjecture, since one could never disprove (b). Yet he considered the disjunctive conclusion to be a &quot;certain fact&quot;.
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=&quot;Searle's strong AI&quot;&gt;
This version is from {{Harvtxt|Searle|1999}}, and is also quoted in {{Harvnb|Dennett|1991|p=435}}. Searle's original formulation was &quot;The appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states.&quot; {{Harv|Searle|1980|p=1}}. Strong AI is defined similarly by {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}: &quot;The assertion that machines could possibly act intelligently (or, perhaps better, act as if they were intelligent) is called the 'weak AI' hypothesis by philosophers, and the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking) is called the 'strong AI' hypothesis.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinese room&quot;&gt;
Searle's [[Chinese room]] argument:

&lt;ref name=&quot;Robot rights&quot;&gt;
[[Robot rights]]:
* {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=964}}

Prematurity of:
* {{Harvnb|Henderson|2007}}
In fiction:
* {{Harvtxt|McCorduck|2004|p=190-25}} discusses ''[[Frankenstein]]'' and identifies the key ethical issues as scientific hubris and the suffering of the monster, i.e. [[robot rights]].
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=&quot;Replaced by machines&quot;&gt;
AI could decrease the demand for human labor:

* {{Harvnb|McCorduck|2004|pp=356–373}}
* {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=961}}
Weizenbaum (the AI researcher who developed the first [[chatterbot]] program, [[ELIZA]]) argued in 1976 that the misuse of artificial intelligence has the potential to devalue human life.

''Multiple'' tests of artificial-intelligence efficacy are needed because, &quot;just as there is no single test of [[Athletics (physical culture)|athletic]] prowess, there cannot be one ultimate test of [[intelligence]].&quot;  One such test, a &quot;Construction Challenge&quot;, would test perception and physical action—&quot;two important elements of intelligent behavior that were entirely absent from the original [[Turing test]].&quot;  Another proposal has been to give machines the same standardized tests of science and other disciplines that schoolchildren take.  A so far insuperable stumbling block to artificial intelligence is an incapacity for reliable [[disambiguation]].  &quot;[V]irtually every sentence [that people generate] is [[ambiguity|ambiguous]], often in multiple ways.&quot;  A prominent example is known as the &quot;pronoun disambiguation problem&quot;:  a machine has no way of determining to whom or what a [[pronoun]] in a sentence—such as &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot; or &quot;it&quot;—refers.
