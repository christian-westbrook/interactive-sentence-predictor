The '''Aegean Sea''' ({{IPAc-en|ᵻ|ˈ|dʒ|iː|ən}}; {{lang-el|Αιγαίο Πέλαγος}} {{IPA-el|eˈʝeo ˈpelaɣos||Ell-Aigaio Pelagos.ogg}};  {{lang-tr|Ege Denizi}} {{IPA-tr|eɟe denizi}}) is an elongated embayment of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] located between the [[Geography of Greece|Greek]] and [[Anatolia]]n [[peninsula]]s, i.e., between the mainlands of [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]]. In the north, it is connected to the [[Marmara Sea]] and [[Black Sea]] by the [[Dardanelles]] and [[Bosphorus]]. The [[Aegean Islands]] are within the sea and some bound it on its southern periphery, including [[Crete]] and [[Rhodes]].

The sea was traditionally known as ''[[Archipelago|the Archipelago]]'' (in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], ''Αρχιπέλαγος'', meaning &quot;chief sea&quot;), but in English the meaning of Archipelago has changed to refer to the Aegean Islands and, generally, to any island group.

==Etymology==
In ancient times, there were various explanations for the name ''Aegean''. It was said to have been named after the Greek town of [[Aegae (Achaea)|Aegae]], or after [[Aegea]], a queen of the [[Amazons]] who died in the sea, or Aigaion, the &quot;sea goat&quot;, another name of [[Briareus]], one of the archaic [[Hecatonchires]], or, especially among the Athenians, [[Aegeus]], the father of [[Theseus]], who drowned himself in the sea when he thought his son had died.

A possible etymology is a derivation from the Greek word ''{{lang|grc|αἶγες}}''&amp;nbsp;– ''aiges'' = &quot;''waves''&quot; ([[Hesychius of Alexandria]]; metaphorical use of {{lang|grc|αἴξ}} (''aix'') &quot;goat&quot;), hence &quot;wavy sea&quot;, cf. also {{lang|grc|αἰγιαλός}} (aigialos = aiges ''(waves)'' + hals ''(sea)''),&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', s.v. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dai)gialo%2Fs &quot;αἰγιαλός&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; hence meaning &quot;sea-shore&quot;.

The [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], who ruled many Greek islands in the [[High Middle Ages|High]] and [[Late Middle Ages]], popularized the name ''Archipelago'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] for &quot;main sea&quot; or &quot;chief sea&quot;), a name that held on in many European countries until the early modern period.

In some South Slavic languages the Aegean is often called ''White Sea'' (''Belo more'' in Serbian, ''Бело море'' in Macedonian and Бяло море ''Byalo more'' in Bulgarian).&lt;ref&gt;Zbornik Matice srpske za društvene nauke: (1961), Volumes 28-31, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=_P7XUZWgJcfAO5-RgZgK&amp;id=GwIdAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BE+%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B5%22&amp;q=%22%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B8+%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B8+%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B8+%D0%B7%D0%B0+%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BD%D0%B0+%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%22+%22%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BE+%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B5%22+%28%D0%95%D0%B3%D0%B5%D1%98%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE+%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B5%2C+%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE+%D0%A1%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%BD%D0%BE+%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B5%29%22#search_anchor p.74] {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The Aegean Sea covers about {{convert|214000|km2}} in area, and measures about {{convert|610|km}} longitudinally and {{convert|300|km}} latitudinally. The sea's maximum depth is {{convert|3543|m}}, east of Crete. The [[Aegean Islands]] are found within its waters, with the following islands delimiting the sea on the south (generally from west to east): [[Kythera]], [[Antikythera]], [[Crete]], [[Kasos]], [[Karpathos]] and [[Rhodes]].

The Aegean Islands, which almost all belong to Greece, can be divided into seven groups:
#[[List of Aegean Islands#The North Aegean Islands|Northeastern Aegean Islands]]
#[[Euboea]]
#Northern [[Sporades]]
#[[Cyclades]]
#[[Saronic Islands]] (or ''Argo-Saronic Islands'')
#[[Dodecanese]] (or ''Southern Sporades''), with the exclusion of [[Kastellorizo]]
#[[Crete]]

The word ''[[archipelago]]'' was originally applied specifically to the Aegean Sea and its islands. Many of the Aegean Islands, or chains of islands, are actually extensions of the mountains on the mainland. One chain extends across the sea to [[Chios]], another extends across [[Euboea]] to [[Samos]], and a third extends across the [[Peloponnese]] and Crete to Rhodes, dividing the Aegean from the Mediterranean.

The bays and gulfs of the Aegean beginning at the South and moving clockwise include on Crete, the [[Mirabello Bay|Mirabello]], [[Almyros Bay|Almyros]], [[Souda Bay|Souda]] and [[Gulf of Chania|Chania]] bays or gulfs, on the mainland the [[Myrtoan Sea]] to the west with the [[Argolic Gulf]], the [[Saronic Gulf]] northwestward, the [[Petalies Gulf]] which connects with the [[Gulf of Euboea|South Euboic Sea]], the [[Pagasetic Gulf]] which connects with the [[Gulf of Euboea|North Euboic Sea]], the [[Thermian Gulf]] northwestward, the [[Chalkidiki]] Peninsula including the [[Cassandra Gulf|Cassandra]] and the [[Singitic Gulf]]s, northward the [[Strymonian Gulf]] and the [[Gulf of Kavala]] and the rest are in [[Turkey]]; [[Saros Gulf]], [[Edremit (District), Balıkesir|Edremit]] Gulf, Dikili Gulf, [[Gulf of Çandarlı]], [[Gulf of İzmir]], [[Gulf of Kuşadası]], [[Gulf of Gökova]], [[Güllük]] Gulf.

===Extent===
The [[International Hydrographic Organization]] defines the limits of the Aegean Sea as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iho.int/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S-23_Ed3_1953_EN.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition|year=1953|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''On the South.'' A line running from Cape Aspro (28°16'E) in [[Asia Minor]], to Cum Burnù (Capo della Sabbia) the Northeast extreme of the Island of [[Rhodes]], through the island to Cape [[Prasonisi]], the Southwest point thereof, on to Vrontos Point (35°33'N) in Skarpanto &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Karpathos]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, through this island to Castello Point, the South extreme thereof, across to Cape Plaka (East extremity of Crete), through Crete to Agria Grabusa, the Northwest extreme thereof, thence to Cape Apolitares in [[Antikythera|Antikithera]] Island, through the island to Psira Rock (off the Northwest point) and across to Cape Trakhili in [[Kythira|Kithera]] Island, through Kithera to the Northwest point (Cape Karavugia) and thence to Cape Santa Maria ({{coord|36|28|N|22|57|E|display=inline}}) in the [[Morea]].
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;''In the [[Dardanelles]]''. A line joining Kum Kale (26°11'E) and [[Cape Helles]].

===Hydrography===
[[File:ParosHuis.JPG|thumb|Traditional street of Lefkes, [[Paros]]-[[Greece]]]]
Aegean surface water circulates in a counter-clockwise [[Ocean gyre|gyre]], with [[hypersaline]] Mediterranean water moving northward along the west coast of [[Turkey]], before being displaced by less dense [[Black Sea]] outflow. The dense [[Mediterranean]] water sinks below the Black Sea inflow to a depth of {{convert|23|-|30|m}}, then flows through the [[Dardanelles Strait]] and into the [[Sea of Marmara]] at velocities of 5–15&amp;nbsp;cm/s. The Black Sea outflow moves westward along the northern Aegean Sea, then flows southwards along the east coast of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Aksu, A. E., D. Yasar, et al. (1995). &quot;LATE GLACIAL-HOLOCENE PALEOCLIMATIC AND PALEOCEANOGRAPHIC EVOLUTION OF THE AEGEAN SEA&amp;nbsp;– MICROPALEONTOLOGICAL AND STABLE ISOTOPIC EVIDENCE.&quot; Marine Micropaleontology 25(1): 1–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical oceanography of the Aegean Sea is controlled mainly by the regional climate, the fresh water discharge from major rivers draining southeastern Europe, and the seasonal variations in the Black Sea surface water outflow through the [[Dardanelles Strait]].

Analysis&lt;ref&gt;Yagar, D., 1994. Late glacial-Holocene evolution of the Aegean Sea. Ph.D. Thesis, Inst. Mar. Sci. Technol., Dokuz Eyltil Univ., 329 pp. (Unpubl.)&lt;/ref&gt; of the Aegean during 1991 and 1992 revealed 3 distinct water masses:

*'''Aegean Sea Surface Water'''&amp;nbsp;– {{convert|40|-|50|m}} thick veneer, with summer temperatures of 21–26&amp;nbsp;°C and winter temperatures ranging from {{convert|10|°C}} in the north to {{convert|16|°C}} in the south.
*'''Aegean Sea Intermediate Water'''&amp;nbsp;– Aegean Sea Intermediate Water extends from 40–50&amp;nbsp;m to {{convert|200|-|300|m}} with temperatures ranging from 11–18&amp;nbsp;°C.
*'''Aegean Sea Bottom Water'''&amp;nbsp;– occurring at depths below 500–1000&amp;nbsp;m with a very uniform temperature (13–14&amp;nbsp;°C) and salinity (3.91–3.92%).

==History==
=== Ancient History ===
[[File:Aegean Sea by Piri Reis.jpg|thumb|275px|Historic map (1528) of Aegean Sea by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[geography|geographer]] [[Piri Reis]]]]
The current coastline dates back to about 4000 BC. Before that time, at the peak of the [[last glacial period|last ice age]] (c. 16,000 BC) sea levels everywhere [[sea level rise|were 130 metres lower]], and there were large well-watered coastal plains instead of much of the northern Aegean. When they were first occupied, the present-day islands including [[Milos]] with its important [[obsidian]] production were probably still connected to the mainland. The present coastal arrangement appeared c. 7000 BC, with post-ice age sea levels continuing to rise for another 3,000 years after that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tjeerd H. van Andel |author2=Judith C. Shackleton |url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/529681?cookieSet=1|title=Late Paleolithic and Mesolithic Coastlines of Greece and the Aegean|publisher=''Journal of Field Archaeology''|volume=9,|issue=4|date=Winter 1982|pages=445–454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subsequent [[Bronze Age]] civilizations of [[Greece]] and the Aegean Sea have given rise to the general term ''[[Aegean civilization]]''. In ancient times, the sea was the birthplace of two ancient civilizations&amp;nbsp;– the [[Minoan civilization|Minoans]] of Crete and the [[Mycenaean Greece|Myceneans]] of the [[Peloponnese]].&lt;ref&gt;Tracey Cullen, ''Aegean Prehistory: A Review'' (American Journal of Archaeology. Supplement, 1); Oliver Dickinson, ''The Aegean Bronze Age'' (Cambridge World Archaeology).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aegeansea.jpg|thumb|left|Satellite view of the Aegean Sea]]
Later arose the city-states of [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]] among many others that constituted the [[Athenian Empire]] and [[Hellenic Civilization]]. [[Plato]] described the Greeks living round the Aegean &quot;like frogs around a pond&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The familiar phrase giving rise to the title ''Prehistorians Round the Pond: Reflections on Aegean Prehistory as a Discipline''|author1=John F. Cherry |author2=Despina Margomenou |author3=Lauren E. Talalay }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aegean Sea was later invaded by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] and the [[Roman Republic|Romans]], and inhabited by the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Romans (Byzantines)]], the [[Bulgarians]], the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]], the [[Seljuq Turks]], and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. The Aegean was the site of the original [[democracy|democracies]], and its seaways were the means of contact among several diverse civilizations of the Eastern Mediterranean.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Modern history===
In the 21st century, the northern Aegean Sea became one of the main scenes of the [[European migrant crisis|Refugee crisis]] as over 1 million [[Syrians]], [[Iraqis]] and [[Afghans]] fled wars and poverty in their countries and attempted to cross the Sea from Turkey to Greece (an [[EU]] member state).{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Economy and politics==
Many of the islands in the Aegean have safe harbours and bays. In ancient times, navigation through the sea was easier than travelling across the rough terrain of the Greek mainland (and to some extent the coastal areas of Anatolia). Many of the islands are [[Volcano|volcanic]], and [[marble]] and [[iron]] are mined on other islands. The larger islands have some fertile valleys and plains. Of the main islands in the Aegean Sea, two belong to [[Turkey]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Bozcaada]] ([[Tenedos]] ''[[Τένεδος]]'') and [[Gökçeada]] ([[Imbros]] ''[[Ίμβρος]]''); the rest belong to [[Greece]]. Between the two countries, there are [[Aegean dispute|political disputes]] over several aspects of political control over the Aegean space, including the size of territorial waters, air control and the [[delimitation]] of economic rights to the [[continental shelf]].
