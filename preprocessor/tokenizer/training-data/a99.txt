'''Apollo''' ([[Attic Greek|Attic]], [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]], and [[Homeric Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀπόλλων}}, ''Apollōn'' ({{small|[[Genitive|GEN]]}} {{lang|grc|Ἀπόλλωνος}}); [[Doric Greek|Doric]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀπέλλων}}, ''Apellōn''; [[Arcadocypriot Greek|Arcadocypriot]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀπείλων}}, ''Apeilōn''; [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]]: {{lang|grc|Ἄπλουν}}, ''Aploun''; {{lang-la|Apollō}}) is one of the most important and complex of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian deities]] in [[Ancient Greek religion|classical Greek]] and [[Ancient Roman religion|Roman religion]] and [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]. The ideal of the ''[[kouros]]'' (a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of music, truth and prophecy, healing, the sun and light, plague, poetry, and more. Apollo is the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Leto]], and has a twin sister, the chaste huntress [[Artemis]]. Apollo is known in Greek-influenced [[Etruscan mythology]] as ''Apulu''.&lt;ref&gt;Krauskopf, I. 2006. &quot;The Grave and Beyond.&quot; ''The Religion of the Etruscans.'' edited by N. de Grummond and E. Simon. Austin: University of Texas Press. p. vii, p. 73-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the patron of [[Delphi]] (''Pythian Apollo''), Apollo was an [[oracular]] god—the prophetic [[deity]] of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]]. Medicine and healing are associated with Apollo, whether through the god himself or mediated through his son [[Asclepius]], yet Apollo was also seen as a god who could bring ill-health and deadly [[Plague (disease)|plague]]. Amongst the god's custodial charges, Apollo became associated with dominion over [[Colonies in antiquity|colonists]], and as the patron defender of herds and flocks. As the leader of the [[Muse]]s (''Apollon Musegetes'') and director of their choir, Apollo functioned as the patron god of music and poetry. [[Hermes]] created the [[lyre]] for him, and the instrument became a common [[Apollo#Attributes and symbols|attribute of Apollo]]. Hymns sung to Apollo were called [[paean]]s.

In Hellenistic times, especially during the 3rd century BCE, as ''Apollo Helios'' he became identified among Greeks with [[Helios]], [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[solar deity|god of the sun]], and his sister Artemis similarly equated with [[Selene]], Titan [[lunar deity|goddess of the moon]].&lt;ref&gt;For the iconography of the Alexander–Helios type, see H. Hoffmann, 1963. &quot;Helios&quot;, in ''Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt'' '''2''', pp. 117–23; cf. Yalouris 1980, no. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin texts, on the other hand, [[Joseph Fontenrose]] declared himself unable to find any [[conflation]] of Apollo with [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]] among the [[Classical Latin|Augustan poets]] of the 1st century, not even in the [[conjuration]]s of [[Aeneas]] and [[Latinus]] in ''[[Aeneid]]'' XII (161–215).&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Fontenrose, &quot;Apollo and Sol in the Latin poets of the first century BC&quot;, ''Transactions of the American Philological Association'' '''30''' (1939), pp 439–55; &quot;Apollo and the Sun-God in Ovid&quot;, ''American Journal of Philology'' '''61''' (1940) pp 429–44; and &quot;Apollo and Sol in the Oaths of Aeneas and Latinus&quot; ''Classical Philology'' '''38'''.2 (April 1943), pp. 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo and Helios/Sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 3rd century CE.

The name ''Apollo''—unlike the related [[List of Mycenaean deities|older name]] ''Paean''—is generally not found in the [[Linear B]] ([[Mycenean Greek]]) texts, although there is a possible attestation in the [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunose]] form '']pe-rjo-['' (Linear B: ]{{lang|gmy|𐀟𐁊}}-[) on the [[Knossos|KN]] E 842 tablet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S.

The [[etymology]] of the name is uncertain. The spelling {{lang|grc|Ἀπόλλων}} ({{IPA-el|a.pól.lɔːn|pron}} in [[Attic Greek|Classical Attic]]) had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the [[common era]], but the [[Dorians|Doric]] form, ''Apellon'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀπέλλων}}), is more archaic, as it is derived from an earlier {{lang|grc|*Ἀπέλjων}}. It probably is a cognate to the Doric month ''Apellaios'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀπελλαῖος}}),&lt;ref name=&quot;DDD&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=van der Toorn |first1=Karel |last2=Becking |first2=Bob |last3=van der Horst |first3=Pieter Willem |title=Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PHgUAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA73 |year=1999 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-11119-6 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the offerings [[apellaia]] ({{lang|grc|ἀπελλαῖα}}) at the initiation of the young men during the family-festival [[apellai]] ({{lang|grc|ἀπέλλαι}}).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The young men became grown-up [[kouros|kouroi]], and Apollon was the &quot;megistos kouros&quot; ( The Great Kouros) : Jane Ellen Harrison (2010): ''Themis: A study to the Social origins of Greek Religion'' Cambridge University Press. pp. 439–441, {{ISBN|1108009492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Visible Religion. Volume IV–V. Approaches to Iconology.'' Leiden, E. J. Brill, 1985 p. 143 [https://books.google.com/books?id=UesUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=apellaia&amp;hl=el&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CgiPU5enDObaygPayYCABg&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=apellaia&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;
According to some scholars, the words are derived from the Doric word ''apella'' ({{lang|grc|ἀπέλλα}}), which originally meant &quot;wall,&quot; &quot;fence for animals&quot; and later &quot;assembly within the limits of the square.&quot;&lt;ref name=Nilsson556&gt;The word usually appears in plural: [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]]: {{lang|grc|ἀπέλλαι}} (''apellai''), {{lang|grc|σηκοί}} (&quot;folds&quot;), {{lang|grc|ἐκκλησίαι}} (&quot;assemblies&quot;), {{lang|grc|ἀρχαιρεσίαι}} (&quot;elections&quot;): Nilsson, Vol. I, p. 556&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doric Greek verb: {{lang|grc|ἀπέλλάζειν}} (&quot;to assemble&quot;), and the festival {{lang|grc|ἀπέλλαι}} (''apellai''), which surely belonged to Apollo. Nilsson, Vol I, p. 556.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apella]] ({{lang|grc|Ἀπέλλα}}) is the name of the popular assembly in Sparta,&lt;ref name=Nilsson556/&gt; corresponding to the ''[[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|ecclesia]]'' ({{lang|grc|ἐκκλησία}}). [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] rejected the connection of the theonym with the noun ''apellai'' and suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] proto-form *''Apal&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;un''.&lt;ref&gt;Beekes, 2009, pp. 115 and 118–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several instances of [[popular etymology]] are attested from ancient authors. Thus, the Greeks most often associated Apollo's name with the Greek verb {{lang|grc|ἀπόλλυμι}} (''apollymi''), &quot;to destroy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Campbell |url=http://www.behindthename.com/php/view.php?name=apollo |title=Meaning, Origin and History of the Name Apollo |publisher=Behind the Name |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] in ''[[Cratylus]]'' connects the name with {{lang|grc|ἀπόλυσις}} (''apolysis''), &quot;redemption&quot;, with {{lang|grc|ἀπόλουσις}} (''apolousis''), &quot;purification&quot;, and with {{lang|grc|ἁπλοῦν}} (''[h]aploun''), &quot;simple&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;The {{lang|grc|ἁπλοῦν}} suggestion is repeated by [[Plutarch]] in ''[[Moralia]]'' in the sense of &quot;[[1 (number)|unity]]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular in reference to the Thessalian form of the name, {{lang|grc|Ἄπλουν}}, and finally with {{lang|grc|Ἀειβάλλων}} (''aeiballon''), &quot;ever-shooting&quot;. [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] connects the name Apollo with the Doric {{lang|grc|ἀπέλλα}} (''apella''), which means &quot;assembly&quot;, so that Apollo would be the god of political life, and he also gives the explanation {{lang|grc|σηκός}} (''sekos''), &quot;fold&quot;, in which case Apollo would be the god of flocks and herds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freese1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911 | inline=1| last=Freese |first=John Henry |wstitle=Apollo }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[ancient Macedonian language]] {{lang|grc|πέλλα}} (''pella'') means &quot;stone,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 1168.&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[toponyms]] may be derived from this word: {{lang|grc|Πέλλα}} ([[Pella]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2380486 Πέλλα / Pella], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon''&lt;/ref&gt; the capital of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|ancient Macedonia]]) and {{lang|grc|Πελλήνη}} (''Pellēnē''/''[[Pallini|Pallene]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson Vol I, p.558&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of non-Greek etymologies have been suggested for the name,&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson, ''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion'', vol. I (C. H. Beck), 1955:555–564.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hittite language|Hittite]] form ''[[Apaliunas]]'' (''&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;{{lang|hit-Latn|x-ap-pa-li-u-na-aš}}'') is attested in the [[Manapa-Tarhunta letter]],&lt;ref&gt;The reading of ''Apaliunas'' and the possible identification with Apollo is due to [[Emil Forrer]] (1931). It was doubted by [[Paul Kretschmer|Kretschmer]], ''Glotta'' XXIV, p. 250. Martin Nilsson (1967), Vol I, p. 559&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps related to [[Hurrian]] (and certainly the [[List of Etruscan mythological figures|Etruscan]]) ''[[Aplu (deity)|Aplu]]'', a god of plague, in turn likely from [[Akkadian]] ''Aplu Enlil'' meaning simply &quot;the son of [[Enlil]]&quot;, a title that was given to the god [[Nergal]], who was linked to [[Shamash]], Babylonian god of the sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grummond&quot;&gt;de Grummond, Nancy Thomson (2006) ''Etruscan Myth, Sacred History, and Legend''. (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology); Mackenzie, Donald A. (2005) ''Myths of Babylonia and Assyria'' (Gutenberg)&lt;/ref&gt;
The role of Apollo as god of plague is evident in the invocation of [[Apollo Smintheus]] (&quot;mouse Apollo&quot;) by Chryses, the Trojan priest of Apollo, with the purpose of sending a plague against the Greeks (the reasoning behind a god of the plague becoming a god of healing is of course [[apotropaic]], meaning that the god responsible for bringing the plague must be appeased in order to remove the plague).

The [[Hittite language|Hittite]] testimony reflects an early form ''{{lang|grc-Latn|*Apeljōn}}'', which may also be surmised from comparison of Cypriot {{lang|grc|Ἀπείλων}} with Doric {{lang|grc|Ἀπέλλων}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Angel |first1=John L. |last2=Mellink |first2=Machteld Johanna | title = Troy and the Trojan War: A Symposium Held at Bryn Mawr College, October 1984| year = 1986| publisher = Bryn Mawr Commentaries| isbn = 978-0-929524-59-7| page = 42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Luwian language|Luwian]] etymology suggested for ''Apaliunas'' makes Apollo &quot;The One of Entrapment&quot;, perhaps in the sense of &quot;Hunter&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Immerwahr |first1=Sara Anderson |last2=Chapin |first2=Anne Proctor | title = Charis: Essays in Honor of Sara A. Immerwahr| year = 2004| publisher = Amer School of Classical| isbn = 978-0-87661-533-1| page = 254 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greco-Roman epithets===
Apollo's chief [[epithet]] was '''Phoebus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|iː|b|ə|s}} {{respell|FEE|bəs}}; {{lang|grc|Φοῖβος}}, ''Phoibos'' {{IPA-el|pʰó͜i.bos|}}), literally &quot;bright&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 1582.&lt;/ref&gt; It was very commonly used by both the Greeks and Romans for Apollo's role as the god of light. Like other Greek deities, he had a number of others applied to him, reflecting the variety of roles, duties, and aspects ascribed to the god. However, while Apollo has a great number of appellations in Greek myth, only a few occur in [[Latin literature]].

The meaning of the epithet &quot;Lyceus&quot; later became associated with Apollo's mother [[Leto]], who was the patron goddess of [[Lycia]] ({{lang|grc|Λυκία}}) and who was identified with the wolf ({{lang|grc|λύκος}}).&lt;ref&gt;Aelian, ''On the Nature of Animals'' 4. 4 (A.F.

*'''Lycoctonus''' ({{IPAc-en|l|aɪ|ˈ|k|ɒ|k|t|ə|n|ə|s}} {{respell|ly|KOK|tə|nəs}}; {{lang|grc|Λυκοκτόνος}}, ''Lykoktonos''), from {{lang|grc|λύκος}}, &quot;wolf&quot;, and {{lang|grc|κτείνειν}}, &quot;to kill&quot;

====Origin and birth====
Apollo's birthplace was [[Cynthus|Mount Cynthus]] on the island of [[Delos]].

*'''Cynthius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|n|θ|i|ə|s}} {{respell|SIN|thee|əs}}; {{lang|grc|Κύνθιος}}, ''Kunthios''), literally &quot;Cynthian&quot;

===Celtic epithets and cult titles===
Apollo was worshipped throughout the [[Roman Empire]]. In the traditionally [[Celtic nations|Celtic]] lands he was most often seen as a healing and sun god. He was often equated with [[List of Celtic gods|Celtic gods]] of similar character.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda J. Green, ''Dictionary of Celtic Myth and Legend'', Thames and Hudson Ltd, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Apollo Atepomarus]]''' (&quot;the great horseman&quot; or &quot;possessing a great horse&quot;). Apollo was worshipped at [[Mauvières]] ([[Indre]]). Horses were, in the Celtic world, closely linked to the sun.&lt;ref&gt;''Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum'' XIII, 1863–1986; A. Ross, ''Pagan Celtic Britain'', 1967; M.J.

==Origins==
[[File:Omphalos museum.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Omphalos]] in the Museum of [[Delphi]]]]
The cult centers of Apollo in Greece, [[Delphi]] and [[Delos]], date from the 8th century BCE. The Delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to [[Artemis]], Apollo's twin sister. At Delphi, Apollo was venerated as the slayer of [[Pytho]]. For the Greeks, Apollo was all the Gods in one and through the centuries he acquired different functions which could originate from different gods. In [[archaic period in Greece|archaic Greece]] he was the [[prophet]], the oracular god who in older times was connected with &quot;healing&quot;. In [[classical period in Greece|classical Greece]] he was the god of light and of music, but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967)&quot;.Die Geschicte der Giechischen Religion.Vol I&quot;.C.F.Beck Verlag.Munchen. p 529&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Burkert]]&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, Walter. ''Greek Religion'', 1985:144.&lt;/ref&gt; discerned three components in the prehistory of Apollo worship, which he termed &quot;a Dorian-northwest Greek component, a Cretan-Minoan component, and a Syro-Hittite component.&quot;

From his eastern origin Apollo brought the art of inspection of &quot;symbols and [[omen|omina]]&quot; (σημεία και τέρατα : ''semeia kai terata''), and of the observation of the [[omen]]s of the days. The inspiration oracular-cult was probably introduced from [[Anatolia]]. The [[ritual]]ism belonged to Apollo from the beginning. The Greeks created the [[Legalism (Western philosophy)|legalism]], the supervision of the orders of the gods, and the demand for moderation and harmony. Apollo became the god of shining youth, the protector of music, spiritual-life, moderation and perceptible order. The improvement of the old [[Anatolia]]n god, and his elevation to an intellectual sphere, may be considered an achievement of the [[Greek people]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nilsson563&quot;&gt;[[Martin P. Nilsson|Martin Nilsson]]. ''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion Vol I'', pp. 563–564&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healer and god-protector from evil===
The function of Apollo as a &quot;healer&quot; is connected with [[Paean (god)|Paean]] ({{lang|grc|Παιών-Παιήων}}), the physician of the Gods in the ''[[Iliad]]'', who seems to come from a more primitive religion.&lt;ref&gt;Paieon ({{lang|grc|Παιήων}}) puts pain-relieving medicines on the wounds of Pluton and Ares ( [[Ilias]] E401). This art is related with Egypt: ([[Odyssey]] D232): M. Nilsson Vol I, p. 543&lt;/ref&gt; Paeοn is probably connected with the [[Mycenean Greece|Mycenean]] ''pa-ja-wo-ne'' (Linear B: {{lang|gmy|𐀞𐀊𐀍𐀚}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mycenaeans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QXwzT1048Z4C&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;pg=PA160#v=onepage&amp;f=false|page=160|first=Louise|last=Schofield|year=2007|publisher=The British Museum Press|isbn=978-0-89236-867-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minoan.deaditerranean.com/linear-b-transliterations/knossos/kn-v/kn-v/#toc-kn-v-52|title=KN V 52+|website=Deaditerranean: Minoan Linear A &amp; Mycenaean Linear B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chawick&gt;{{cite book|last=Chadwick|first=John|author-link=John Chadwick|title=The Mycenaean World|location=Cambridge, UK|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1976|isbn=0-521-29037-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RMj7M_tGaNMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA89#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=89}} At Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; but this is not certain. He did not have a separate cult, but he was the personification of the holy magic-song sung by the magicians that was supposed to cure disease. Later the Greeks knew the original meaning of the relevant song &quot;paean&quot; ({{lang|grc|παιάν}}). The magicians were also called &quot;seer-doctors&quot; ({{lang|grc|ἰατρομάντεις}}), and they used an ecstatic prophetic art which was used exactly by the god Apollo at the oracles.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|grc|Ἐπὶ καταπαύσει λοιμῶν καὶ νόσων ᾄδόμενος}}. ''Which is sung to stop the plagues and the diseases''. Proklos: Chrestom from Photios Bibl. code. 239, p. 321: Martin Nilsson. Die Geschicthe der Griechischen religion. Vol I, p. 543&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Iliad'', Apollo is the healer under the gods, but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows, similar to the function of the [[Vedic]] god of disease [[Rudra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin Nilsson 1967 p. 541&quot;&gt;&quot;The conception that the diseases come from invisible shots sent by magicians or supernatural beings is common in primitive people and also in European folklore. In North-Europe they speak of the &quot;[[Elf-shot]]s&quot;. In Sweden where the Lapps were called magicians, they speak of the &quot;Lappen-shots&quot;. Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I, p. 541&lt;/ref&gt; He sends a plague ({{lang|grc|λοιμός}}) to the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]]. The god who sends a disease can also prevent it; therefore, when it stops, they make a purifying ceremony and offer him a [[hecatomb]] to ward off evil. When the oath of his priest appeases, they pray and with a song they call their own god, the ''Paean''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ilias]] A 314. Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I, p. 543&lt;/ref&gt;

Some common epithets of Apollo as a healer are &quot;paion&quot; ({{lang|grc|παιών}}, literally &quot;healer&quot; or &quot;helper&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0062:entry=paean-harpers]: Harper's Dictionary of classical antiquity&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;epikourios&quot; ({{lang|grc|ἐπικουρώ}}, &quot;help&quot;), &quot;oulios&quot; ({{lang|grc|οὐλή}}, &quot;healed wound&quot;, also a &quot;scar&quot; )&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0099,001:14:1:6&amp;lang=original Perseus.tufts.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;loimios&quot; ({{lang|grc|λοιμός}}, &quot;plague&quot;). In classical times, his strong function in popular religion was to keep away evil, and was therefore called &quot;apotropaios&quot; ({{lang|grc|ἀποτρέπω}}, &quot;divert&quot;, &quot;deter&quot;, &quot;avert&quot;) and &quot;alexikakos&quot; (from [[verb|v.]] {{lang|grc|ἀλέξω}} + [[noun|n.]] {{lang|grc|κακόν}}, &quot;defend from evil&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias VIII 41, 8-IV 34, 7-Sittig. Nom P. 48. f-Aristoph. Vesp. V. 61-Paus. I 3, 4. Martin Nilsson (1967) Vol I, p. 540, 544&lt;/ref&gt; In later writers, the word, usually spelled &quot;Paean&quot;, becomes a mere epithet of Apollo in his capacity as a god of [[healing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Graf| first = Fritz| title = Apollo| url = https://books.google.com/?id=it9n9_I-UOkC&amp;pg=PA66| year = 2008| publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis| isbn = 978-0-203-58171-1| page = 66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homer illustrated Paeon the god, and the song both of [[apotropaic]] thanksgiving or triumph.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}
Such songs were originally addressed to Apollo, and afterwards to other gods: to [[Dionysus]], to Apollo [[Helios]], to Apollo's son [[Asclepius]] the healer. About the 4th century BCE, the paean became merely a formula of adulation; its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune, or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered. It was in this way that Apollo had become recognised as the god of music. Apollo's role as the slayer of the [[Python (mythology)|Python]] led to his association with battle and victory; hence it became the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle, when a fleet left the harbour, and also after a victory had been won.

===Dorian origin===
[[File:Apollo-WaltersArt.jpg|left|thumb|''Apollo Victorious over the Python'' by the Florentine [[Pietro Francavilla]] (dated 1591) depicting Apollo's first triumph, when he slew with his bow and arrows the serpent Python, which lies dead at his feet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[The Walters Art Museum]]

| accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Walters Art Museum|The Walters Art Museum]]).]]
The connection with the Dorians and their initiation festival ''[[apellai]]'' is reinforced by the month ''Apellaios'' in northwest Greek calendars .&lt;ref&gt;Graf, ''Apollo'', pp. 104–113; Burkert also notes in this context [[Archilochus]] ''Fr.'' 94.&lt;/ref&gt; The family-festival was dedicated to Apollo ([[Dorians|Doric]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀπέλλων}}).&lt;ref&gt;Walter Burkert (1985) ''Greek Religion''. Harvard University Press. p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; ''Apellaios'' is the month of these rites, and Apellon is the &quot;megistos kouros&quot; (the great Kouros).&lt;ref&gt;Jane Ellen Harrison (2010): ''Themis: A study to the Social origins of Greek Religion''. Cambridge University Press. p. 441. {{ISBN|1108009492}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However it can explain only the Doric type of the name, which is connected with the [[Ancient Macedonian language|Ancient Macedonian]] word &quot;pella&quot; ([[Pella]]), ''stone''. Stones played an important part in the cult of the god, especially in the oracular shrine of Delphi ([[Omphalos]]).&lt;ref&gt;Compare: [[Baetylus]]. In Semitic: sacred stone&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I. p. 556&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Homeric hymn&quot; represents Apollo as a Northern intruder. His arrival must have occurred during the &quot;Dark Ages&quot; that followed the destruction of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilization]], and his conflict with [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (Mother Earth) was represented by the legend of his slaying her daughter the serpent [[Python (mythology)|Python]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert W. Park (1956). ''The delphic oracle''. Vol.I, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The earth deity had power over the ghostly world, and it is believed that she was the deity behind the oracle.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Farnel(1909)''The cult of the city states. Clarendon Press. VIII. pp. 8–10''&lt;/ref&gt; The older tales mentioned two dragons who were perhaps intentionally conflated. A female dragon named [[Delphyne]] ({{lang|grc|δελφύς}}, &quot;womb&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Ddelfu%2Fs δελφύς]&lt;/ref&gt; and a male serpent [[Typhon]] ({{lang|grc|τύφειν}}, &quot;to smoke&quot;), the adversary of [[Zeus]] in the [[Titanomachy]], who the narrators confused with [[Python (mythology)|Python]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Many pictures show the serpent Python living in amity with Apollo and guarding the Omphalos. Karl Kerenyi (1951). ed. 1980: ''The gods of the Greeks'', pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In a Pompeian fresco Python is lying peacefully on the ground and the priests with the sacred double axe in their hand bring the bull (''bouphronion''). Jane. H. Harisson (1912): ''Themis. A study of the social origins of the Greek religion''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 423–424&lt;/ref&gt; Python was the good [[Daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]] (ἀγαθὸς δαίμων) of the temple as it appears in [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] religion,&lt;ref&gt;In Minoan religion the serpent is the protector of the household (underground stored corn). Also in Greek religion, &quot;snake of the house&quot; ({{lang|grc|οἰκουρὸς ὄφις}}) in the temple of [[Athena]] at Acropolis, etc., and in Greek folklore. Martin Nilsson, Vol.I, pp. 213–214&lt;/ref&gt; but she was represented as a dragon, as often happens in Northern European folklore as well as in the East.&lt;ref&gt;Nordig sagas. [[Hittites|Hittite]] myth of [[Illuyankas]]. Also in the Bible: [[Leviathan]]. W. Porzig (1930).'' Illuyankas and Typhon. Kleinasiatische Forschung'', pp. 379–386&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollo and his sister [[Artemis]] can bring death with their arrows. The conception that diseases and death come from invisible shots sent by supernatural beings, or magicians is common in [[Germanic mythology|Germanic]] and [[Norse mythology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin Nilsson 1967 p. 541&quot;/&gt; In [[Greek mythology]] Artemis was the leader ({{lang|grc|ἡγεμών}}, &quot;hegemon&quot;) of the [[nymphs]], who had similar functions with the [[Norse mythology|Nordic]] [[Elf|Elves]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nilsson499&quot;&gt;. Martin Nilsson (1967), Vol I, pp. 499–500&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;elf-shot&quot; originally indicated disease or death attributed to the elves, but it was later attested denoting stone [[arrow (weapon)|arrow]]-heads which were used by witches to harm people, and also for healing rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Alaric. 2005. 'Getting Shot of Elves: Healing, Witchcraft and Fairies in the Scottish Witchcraft Trials', [http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/5597/], 116 (2005), pp.&amp;nbsp;19–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vedic]] Rudra has some similar functions with Apollo. The terrible god is called &quot;The Archer&quot;, and the bow is also an attribute of [[Shiva]].&lt;ref&gt;For {{IAST|Śarva}} as a name of Shiva see: Apte, p.&amp;nbsp;910.&lt;/ref&gt; Rudra could bring diseases with his arrows, but he was able to free people of them, and his alternative Shiba is a healer physician god.&lt;ref&gt;For association between Rudra and disease, with Rigvedic references, see: Bhandarkar, p.&amp;nbsp;146.&lt;/ref&gt; However the [[Indo-European language|Indo-European]] component of Apollo does not explain his strong relation with omens, exorcisms, and with the oracular cult.

===Minoan origin===
[[File:AMI - Goldene Doppelaxt.jpg|thumb|250px|Ornamented golden [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[labrys]]]]
It seems an oracular cult existed in Delphi from the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] age.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Odyssey]]'' 8.80&lt;/ref&gt; In historical times, the priests of Delphi were called [[labrys|Labryaden]], &quot;the double-axe men&quot;, which indicates [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] origin. The double-axe, [[labrys]], was the holy symbol of the [[Crete|Cretan]] [[labyrinth]].&lt;ref&gt;Huxley (1975). ''Cretan Paewones. Roman and Byzantine studies'', pp.&amp;nbsp;129–134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.G.Wunderlich. ''The secret of Creta'' Souvenir Press Ltd. London p.&amp;nbsp;319&lt;/ref&gt; The Homeric hymn adds that Apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried Cretan priests to Delphi, where they evidently transferred their religious practices. ''Apollo Delphinios'' or ''Delphidios'' was a sea-god especially worshiped in Crete and in the islands.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol&amp;nbsp;I, p.&amp;nbsp;554 A4&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo's sister [[Artemis]], who was the Greek goddess of hunting, is identified with [[Britomartis]] ([[Diktynna]]), the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] &quot;Mistress of the animals&quot;. In her earliest depictions she is accompanied by the &quot;Mister of the animals&quot;, a male god of hunting who had the bow as his attribute. His original name is unknown, but it seems that he was absorbed by the more popular Apollo, who stood by the virgin &quot;Mistress of the Animals&quot;, becoming her brother.&lt;ref name=Nilsson499/&gt;

The old oracles in Delphi seem to be connected with a local tradition of the priesthood, and there is not clear evidence that a kind of inspiration-prophecy existed in the temple. This led some scholars to the conclusion that Pythia carried on the rituals in a consistent procedure through many centuries, according to the local tradition. In that regard, the mythical seeress [[Sibyl]] of [[Anatolia]]n origin, with her ecstatic art, looks unrelated to the oracle itself.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Bowden (2005). ''Classical Athens and the Delphic oracle'', pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Greek tradition is referring to the existence of vapours and chewing of laurel-leaves, which seem to be confirmed by recent studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = William J.

[[Plato]] describes the priestesses of Delphi and [[Dodona]] as frenzied women, obsessed by &quot;[[mania]]&quot; ({{lang|grc|μανία}}, &quot;frenzy&quot;), a Greek word he connected with ''mantis'' ({{lang|grc|μάντις}}, &quot;prophet&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|ma/ntis|μάντις|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Frenzied women like Sibyls from whose lips the god speaks are recorded in the [[Near East]] as [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] in the second millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Burkert (1985).''The Greek religion''. p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Although Crete had contacts with Mari from 2000 BC,&lt;ref&gt;F.Schachermeyer (1964). p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; there is no evidence that the ecstatic prophetic art existed during the Minoan and Mycenean ages. It is more probable that this art was introduced later from [[Anatolia]] and regenerated an existing oracular cult that was local to Delphi and dormant in several areas of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I, pp. 543–545&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anatolian origin===
[[File:Coin of Apollo Agyieus.png|thumb|250px|Illustration of a coin of Apollo Agyieus from [[Ambracia]]]]
A non-Greek origin of Apollo has long been assumed in scholarship.&lt;ref name=&quot;DDD&quot;/&gt; The name of Apollo's mother [[Leto]] has [[Lydia]]n origin, and she was worshipped on the coasts of [[Asia Minor]]. The inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into Greece from [[Anatolia]], which is the origin of [[Sibyl]], and where existed some of the oldest oracular shrines. Omens, symbols, purifications, and exorcisms appear in old [[Assyria|Assyro]]-[[Babylon]]ian texts, and these rituals were spread into the empire of the [[Hittites]]. In a Hittite text is mentioned that the king invited a Babylonian priestess for a certain &quot;purification&quot;.&lt;ref name=Nilsson563/&gt;

A similar story is mentioned by [[Plutarch]]. He writes that the [[Creta]]n [[prophet|seer]] [[Epimenides]] purified [[Athens]] after the pollution brought by the [[Alcmeonidae]], and that the seer's expertise in [[sacrifice]]s and reform of funeral practices were of great help to [[Solon]] in his reform of the Athenian state.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Solon'', 12; [[Aristotle]], ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Ath. Pol]]''. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The story indicates that Epimenides was probably heir to the [[Shamanism#Asia|shamanic religions of Asia]], and proves, together with the [[Homeric]] hymn, that Crete had a resisting religion up to historical times. It seems that these rituals were dormant in Greece, and they were reinforced when the Greeks migrated to [[Anatolia]].

[[Homer]] pictures Apollo on the side of the [[Troy|Trojans]], fighting against the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]], during the [[Trojan War]]. He is pictured as a terrible god, less trusted by the Greeks than other gods. The god seems to be related to ''Appaliunas'', a tutelary god of [[Wilusa]] ([[Troy]]) in Asia Minor, but the word is not complete.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Kretschmer]] (1936). Glotta XXIV p. 250. Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I, p. 559.&lt;/ref&gt; The stones found in front of the gates of [[Homer]]ic Troy were the symbols of Apollo. The Greeks gave to him the name {{lang|grc|ἀγυιεύς}} ''[[agyieus]]'' as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil, and his symbol was a tapered stone or column.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson, ''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion.'' vol. I (C. H. Beck), 1955:563f.&lt;/ref&gt; However, while usually Greek festivals were celebrated at the [[full moon]], all the feasts of Apollo were celebrated at the seventh day of the month, and the emphasis given to that day (''sibutu'') indicates a [[Babylonia]]n origin.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I, p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Late Bronze Age]] (from 1700 to 1200 BCE) [[Hittites|Hittite]] and [[Hurrian]] ''Aplu'' was a god of [[Plague (disease)|plague]], invoked during plague years. Here we have an [[apotrope|apotropaic]] situation, where a god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end it. Aplu, meaning ''the son of'', was a title given to the god [[Nergal]], who was linked to the Babylonian god of the sun [[Shamash]].&lt;ref name=Grummond /&gt; Homer interprets Apollo as a terrible god ({{lang|grc|δεινὸς θεός}}) who brings death and disease with his arrows, but who can also heal, possessing a magic art that separates him from the other Greek gods.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I. pp. 559–560.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Iliad]]'', his priest prays to ''Apollo Smintheus'',&lt;ref&gt;&quot;You Apollo Smintheus, let my tears become your arrows against the Danaans, for revenge&quot;. [[Iliad]] 1.33 (A 33).&lt;/ref&gt; the mouse god who retains an older agricultural function as the protector from field rats.&lt;ref name=LSJsmintheus/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An ancient aetiological myth connects ''sminthos'' with mouse and suggests Cretan origin. Apollo is the mouse-god (Strabo 13.1.48).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sminthia&quot; in several areas of Greece. In [[Rhodes]] (Lindos) they belong to Apollo and Dionysos who have destroyed the rats that were swallowing the grapes&quot;. Martin Nilsson (1967). pp. 534–535.&lt;/ref&gt; All these functions, including the function of the healer-god [[Paean (god)|Paean]], who seems to have Mycenean origin, are fused in the cult of Apollo.

==Oracular cult==
[[File:Columns of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, Greece.jpeg|thumb|250px|Columns of the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]] at Delphi, Greece]]
Unusually among the Olympic deities, Apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence: [[Delos]] and [[Delphi]]. In cult practice, [[Delos|Delian Apollo]] and [[Pythian Apollo]] (the Apollo of Delphi) were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1985:143.&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo's [[Cult (religion)|cult]] was already fully established when written sources commenced, about 650 BCE. Apollo became extremely important to the Greek world as an oracular deity in the [[Archaic Greece|archaic period]], and the frequency of [[theophoric names]] such as ''Apollodorus'' or ''Apollonios'' and cities named ''Apollonia'' testify to his popularity. Oracular sanctuaries to Apollo were established in other sites. In the 2nd and 3rd century CE, those at [[Didyma]] and [[Clarus]] pronounced the so-called &quot;theological oracles&quot;, in which Apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an [[Monism#Monism, pantheism, and panentheism|all-encompassing, highest deity]]. &quot;In the 3rd century, Apollo fell silent. [[Julian the Apostate]] (359 - 61) tried to revive the Delphic oracle, but failed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DDD&quot;/&gt;

===Oracular shrines===
[[File:Delos lions.jpg|thumb|250px|Delos lions]]
Apollo had a famous [[oracle]] in Delphi, and other notable ones in [[Clarus]] and [[Branchidae]]. His oracular shrine in [[Abae]] in [[Phocis]], where he bore the [[toponym]]ic epithet ''[[Abaeus]]'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀπόλλων Ἀβαῖος}}, ''Apollon Abaios''), was important enough to be consulted by [[Croesus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], 1.46.&lt;/ref&gt;
His oracular shrines include:
* [[Abae]] in [[Phocis]].
* [[Bassae]] in the [[Peloponnese]].
* At [[Clarus]], on the west coast of [[Asia Minor]]; as at Delphi a holy spring which gave off a ''pneuma'', from which the priests drank.
* In [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], the Oracle of Corinth came from the town of [[Tenea]], from prisoners supposedly taken in the Trojan War.
* At [[Khyrse]], in [[Troad]], the temple was built for Apollo Smintheus.
* In [[Delos]], there was an oracle to the Delian Apollo, during summer. The Hieron (Sanctuary) of Apollo adjacent to the Sacred Lake, was the place where the god was said to have been born.
* In [[Delphi]], the [[Pythia]] became filled with the ''[[pneuma]]'' of Apollo, said to come from a spring inside the [[Adyton]].
* In [[Didyma]], an oracle on the coast of [[Anatolia]], south west of [[Lydia]]n ([[Luwian]]) [[Sardis]], in which priests from the lineage of the Branchidae received inspiration by drinking from a healing spring located in the temple. Was believed to have been founded by [[Branchus]], son or lover of Apollo.
* In [[Manbij|Hierapolis Bambyce]], Syria (modern Manbij), according to the treatise ''[[De Dea Syria]]'', the sanctuary of the [[Atargatis|Syrian Goddess]] contained a robed and bearded image of Apollo. Divination was based on spontaneous movements of this image.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucian]] (attrib.), ''[[De Dea Syria]]'' [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/tsg/tsg07.htm#35 35–37].&lt;/ref&gt;
* At [[Patara (Lycia)|Patara]], in [[Lycia]], there was a seasonal winter oracle of Apollo, said to have been the place where the god went from Delos. As at Delphi the oracle at Patara was a woman.
* In [[Segesta]] in Sicily.

Oracles were also given by sons of Apollo.
* In [[Oropus]], north of [[Athens]], the oracle [[Amphiaraus]], was said to be the son of Apollo; Oropus also had a sacred spring.
* in Labadea, {{convert|20|mi|km}} east of Delphi, [[Trophonius]], another son of Apollo, killed his brother and fled to the cave where he was also afterwards consulted as an oracle.

==Temples of Apollo==
{{Main|Ancient Greek temple|Roman temple}}

Many temples were dedicated to Apollo in Greece and the Greek colonies. They show the spread of the cult of Apollo and the evolution of the Greek architecture, which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations. Some of the earliest temples, especially in [[Crete]], do not belong to any Greek order. It seems that the first peripteral temples were rectanglular wooden structures. The different wooden elements were considered [[divine]], and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of [[Doric order]]. The Greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances. The temples should be canonic, and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection.&lt;ref&gt;To know what a thing is, we must know the look of it&quot;: Rhys Carpenter: ''The esthetic basis of Greek art''. Indiana University Press. p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; From the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings. The first buildings were built narrowly in order to hold the roof, and when the dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms. This probably influenced the theory of numbers of [[Pythagoras]], who believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics.&lt;ref name=&quot;C. M. Bowra 1957 p. 166&quot;&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957). ''The Greek experience'', p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Doric order]] dominated during the 6th and the 5th century BC but there was a mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs, which couldn’t be solved without changing the original forms. The order was almost abandoned for the [[Ionic order]], but the Ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of a temple. Both orders were abandoned for the [[Corinthian order]] gradually during the Hellenistic age and under Rome.

The most important temples are:

===Greek temples===
*[[Thebes, Greece]]: The oldest temple probably dedicated to ''Apollo Ismenius'' was built in the 9th century B.C. It seems that it was a curvilinear building. The [[Doric order|Doric]] temple was built in the early 7th century B.C., but only some small parts have been found &lt;ref&gt;William Dinsmoor (1950),''The architecture of Ancient Greece'', p. 218, {{ISBN|0-8196-0283-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A festival called [[Daphnephoria]] was celebrated every ninth year in honour of Apollo Ismenius (or Galaxius). The people held laurel branches (daphnai), and at the head of the procession walked a youth (chosen priest of Apollo), who was called &quot;daphnephoros&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;William Smith 1875. p. 384&quot;&gt;William Smith.'' A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', John Murray, London, 1875. p. 384&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Eretria]]: According to the Homeric hymn to Apollo, the god arrived to the plain, seeking for a location to establish its oracle. The first temple of ''Apollo Daphnephoros'', &quot;Apollo, laurel-bearer&quot;, or &quot;carrying off Daphne&quot;, is dated to 800 B.C. The temple was curvilinear ''hecatombedon'' (a hundred feet). In a smaller building were kept the bases of the laurel branches which were used for the first building. Another temple probably peripteral was built in the 7th century B.C., with an inner row of wooden columns over its Geometric predecessor. It was rebuilt peripteral around 510 B.C., with the [[stylobate]] measuring 21,00 x 43,00 m. The number of [[pteron]] column was 6 x 14.&lt;ref&gt;[http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/2/eh251.jsp?obj_id=1689 Hellenic Ministry of culture, Temple of Apollo Daphnephoros] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912212901/http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/2/eh251.jsp?obj_id=1689 |date=12 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rufus B. Richardson, &quot;A Temple in Eretria&quot; ''The American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts'', '''10'''.3 (July – September 1895:326–337)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Dreros]] ([[Crete]]). The temple of ''Apollo Delphinios'' dates from the 7th century B.C., or probably from the middle of the 8th century B.C. According to the legend, Apollo appeared as a dolphin, and carried Cretan priests to the port of [[Delphi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin Nilsson 1967 p. 529&quot;&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol&amp;nbsp;I, p.&amp;nbsp;529&lt;/ref&gt; The dimensions of the plan are 10,70 x 24,00 m and the building was not peripteral. It contains column-bases of the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] type, which may be considered as the predecessors of the [[Doric order|Doric]] columns.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson pp. 56 and 323&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Gortyn]] ([[Crete]]). A temple of ''Pythian Apollo'', was built in the 7th century B.C. The plan measured 19,00 x 16,70 m and it was not peripteral. The walls were solid, made from limestone, and there was single door on the east side.
*[[Thermon]] ([[West Greece]]): The [[Doric order|Doric]] temple of ''Apollo Thermios'', was built in the middle of the 7th century B.C. It was built on an older curvilinear building dating perhaps from the 10th century B.C., on which a [[peristyle]] was added. The temple was narrow, and the number of pteron columns (probably wooden) was 5 x 15. There was a single row of inner columns. It measures 12.13 x 38.23 m at the stylobate, which was made from stones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spivey, p. 112&quot;&gt;Spivey, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Apollotempel.gif|thumb|left|200px| Floor plan of the temple of Apollo, Corinth]]
*[[Corinth]]: A [[Doric order|Doric]] temple was built in the 6th century B.C. The temple's [[stylobate]] measures 21.36 x 53.30 m, and the number of pteron columns was 6 x 15. There was a double row of inner columns. The style is similar with the Temple of Alcmeonidae at [[Delphi]].&lt;ref&gt;Robertson p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; The Corinthians were considered to be the inventors of the [[Doric order]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Spivey, p. 112&quot;/&gt;
*Napes ([[Lesbos]]): An [[Aeolic order|Aeolic]] temple probably of ''Apollo Napaios'' was built in the 7th century B.C. Some special capitals with floral ornament have been found, which are called [[Aeolic order|Aeolic]], and it seems that they were borrowed from the East.&lt;ref name=Robertson324&gt;D.S Robertson(1945):''A handbook of Greek and Roman architecture'', Cambridge University Press pp. 324-329&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Cyrene, Libya]]: The oldest [[Doric order|Doric]] temple of Apollo was built in c. 600 B.C. The number of pteron columns was 6 x 11, and it measures 16.75 x 30.05 m at the stylobate. There was a double row of sixteen inner columns on stylobates. The capitals were made from stone.&lt;ref name=Robertson324/&gt;
*[[Naukratis]]: An [[Ionic order|Ionic]] temple was built in the early 6th century B.C. Only some fragments have been found and the earlier, made from limestone, are identified among the oldest of the [[Ionic order]].&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Siracusa-Temple-of-Apoll-Plan-bjs.png|thumb|right|200px|Floor plan of the temple of Apollo, Syracuse]]
*[[Syracuse, Sicily]]: A [[Doric order|Doric]] temple was built at the beginning of the 6th century B.C. The temple's [[stylobate]] measures 21.47 x 55.36 m and the number of pteron columns was 6 x 17. It was the first temple in Greek west built completely out of stone. A second row of columns were added, obtaining the effect of an inner porch.&lt;ref&gt;Mertens 2006, pp. 104–109.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Selinus]] ([[Sicily]]):The [[Doric order|Doric]] [[Temple C (Selinus)|Temple C]] dates from 550 B.C., and it was probably dedicated to Apollo. The temple's stylobate measures 10.48 x 41.63 m and the number of pteron columns was 6 x 17. There was portico with a second row of columns, which is also attested for the temple at [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Inscriptiones Graecorum|IG]] XIV 269&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Delphi]]: The first temple dedicated to Apollo, was built in the 7th century B.C. According to the legend, it was wooden made of laurel branches. The &quot;Temple of Alcmeonidae&quot; was built in c. 513 B.C. and it is the oldest Doric temple with significant marble elements. The temple's stylobate measures 21.65 x 58.00 m, and the number of pteron columns as 6 x 15.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancient-greece.org/architecture/delphi-temple-of-apollo.html Temple of Apollo at Delphi], Ancient-Greece.org&lt;/ref&gt; A fest similar with Apollo's fest at [[Thebes, Greece]] was celebrated every nine years. A boy was sent to the temple, who walked on the sacred road and returned carrying a laurel branch (''dopnephoros''). The maidens participated with joyful songs.&lt;ref name=&quot;William Smith 1875. p. 384&quot;/&gt;
*[[Chios]]: An [[Ionic order|Ionic]] temple of ''Apollo Phanaios'' was built at the end of the 6th century B.C. Only some small parts have been found, but the capitals had floral ornament.&lt;ref name=Robertson324/&gt;
*[[Abae]] ([[Phocis (ancient region)|Phocis]]). The temple was destroyed by the [[Persia]]ns in the invasion of [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] in 480 B.C., and later by the [[Boeotia]]ns. It was rebuilt by [[Hadrian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2011|p=1}}{{Citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oracle was in use from early [[Mycenae]]an times to the Roman period, and shows the continuity of Mycenaean and Classical Greek religion.&lt;ref&gt;See reports of the German Archaeological Institute in Archaeological Reports for 2008/9 43-45&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Bassae]] ([[Peloponnesus]]):A temple dedicated to ''Apollo Epikourios'' (&quot;Apollo the helper&quot;), was built in 430 B.C. and it was designed by [[Iktinos]].It combined [[Doric order|Doric]] and [[Ionic order|Ionic]] elements, and the earliest use of column with a [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] capital in the middle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/3/eh351.jsp?obj_id=6664 Hellenic Ministry of Culture: The Temple of Epicurean Apollo].&lt;/ref&gt; The temple is of a relatively modest size, with the [[stylobate]] measuring 14.5 x 38.3 metres&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO&quot;&gt;[http://www.worldheritagesite.org/sites/apolloepicurius.html Temple of Apollo Epicurius at Bassae], World Heritage Site.&lt;/ref&gt; containing a [[Doric order|Doric]] [[peristyle]] of 6 x 15 columns. The roof left a central space open to admit light and air.*[[Delos]]: A temple probably dedicated to Apollo and not peripteral, was built in the late 7th century B.C., with a plan measuring 10,00 x 15,60 m. The [[Doric order|Doric]] Great temple of Apollo, was built in c. 475 B.C. The temple's stylobate measures 13.72 x 29.78 m, and the number of pteron columns as 6 x 13. Marble was extensively used.&lt;ref name=Robertson324/&gt;
*[[Ambracia]]: A [[Doric order|Doric]] peripteral temple dedicated to ''Apollo Pythios Sotir'' was built in 500 B.C., and It is lying at the centre of the Greek city [[Arta, Greece|Arta]]. Only some parts have been found, and it seems that the temple was built on earlier sanctuaries dedicated to Apollo. The temple measures 20,75 x 44,00 m at the [[stylobate]].

[[File:Tempel des Apollo Didymaeos in Milet.png|right|thumb|180px|Temple of Apollo, Didyma]]
*[[Didyma]] (near [[Miletus]]): The gigantic [[Ionic order|Ionic]] temple of ''Apollo Didymaios'' started around 540 B.C. The construction ceased and then it was restarted in 330 B.C. The temple is dipteral, with an outer row of 10 x 21 columns, and it measures 28.90 x 80.75 m at the stylobate.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schneider: ''Neue Funde vom archaischen Apollontempel in Didyma''.

*[[Clarus]] (near ancient [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]]): According to the legend, the famous seer Calchas, on his return from Troy, came to Clarus. He challenged the seer Mopsus, and died when he lost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0064:entry=clarus-geo perseus tufts Clarus]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Doric order|Doric]] temple of ''Apollo Clarius'' was probably built in the 3rd century B.C., and it was peripteral with 6 x 11 columns. It was reconstructed at the end of the Hellenistic period, and later from the emperor [[Hadrian]] but Pausanias claims that it was still incomplete in the 2nd century B.C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klaros.org/apollon-klarios-tapinagi-ve-sunaklari?lang=en Prophecy centre of Apollo Clarius]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hamaxitus]] ([[Troad]]): In [[Iliad]], [[Chryses]] the priest of Apollo, addresses the god with the epithet Smintheus (Lord of Mice), related with the god’s ancient role as bringer of the disease (plague). Recent excavations indicate that the Hellenistic temple of ''Apollo Smintheus'' was constructed at 150–125 B.C., but the symbol of the mouse god was used on coinage probably from the 4th century B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Bresson (2007) 154-5, citing the excavations reports of Özgünel (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; The temple measures 40,00 x 23,00 m at the [[stylobate]], and the number of pteron columns was 8 x 14.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson p.333&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etruscan and Roman temples===
*[[Veii]] ([[Etruria]]): The temple of Apollo was built in the late 6th century B.C. and it indicates the spread of Apollo’s culture (Aplu) in Etruria. There was a prostyle porch, which is called [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]], and a triple cella 18,50 m wide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robertson pp. 200-201&quot;&gt;Robertson pp. 200-201&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Falerii Veteres]] ([[Etruria]]): A temple of Apollo was built probably in the 4th-3rd century B.C. Parts of a teraccotta capital, and a teraccotta base have been found. It seems that the Etruscan columns were derived from the archaic Doric.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robertson pp. 200-201&quot;/&gt; A cult of [[Soranus (mythology)|Apollo Soranus]] is attested by one inscription found near Falerii.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0006:entry=falerii-veteres Perseus tufts: Falerii Veteres]&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Pompeii]] (Italy): The cult of Apollo was widespread in the region of Campania since the 6th century B.C. The temple was built in 120 B.V, but its beginnings lie in the 6th century B.C. It was reconstructed after an earthquake in A.D. 63. It demonstrates a mixing of styles which formed the basis of Roman architecture. The columns in front of the cella formed a [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]] prostyle porch, and the cella is situated unusually far back. The peripteral colonnade of 48 [[Ionic order|Ionic]] columns was placed in such a way that the emphasis was given to the front side.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson CSA :[http://sites.davidson.edu/csa/the-temple-of-apollo-at-pompeii-a-mishmash-of-architecture/ Temple of Apollo, Pompeii]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rome: The [[temple of Apollo Sosianus]] and the ''temple of Apollo Medicus''. The first temple building dates to 431 B.C., and was dedicated to Apollo Medicus (the doctor), after a plague of 433 B.C..&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/livy/liv.4.shtml#25 Livy 4.25]&lt;/ref&gt; It was rebuilt by [[Gaius Sosius]], probably in 34 B.C. Only three columns with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] capitals exist today. It seems that the cult of Apollo had existed in this area since at least to the mid-5th century B.C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/livy/liv.34.shtml#43 Livy 34.43]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Rome:The [[temple of Apollo Palatinus]] was located on the Palatine hill within the sacred boundary of the city. It was dedicated by [[Augustus]] on 28 B.C. The façade of the original temple was [[Ionic order|Ionic]] and it was constructed from solid blocks of marble. Many famous statues by Greek masters were on display in and around the temple, including a marble statue of the god at the entrance and a statue of Apollo in the cella.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Aedes_Apollinis_Palatini.html A topographical dictionary of Ancient Rome]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
{{Main|Greek mythology}}

===Birth===
[[File:Apollo Artemis Brygos Louvre G151.jpg|thumb|250px|Apollo (left) and [[Artemis]]. [[Brygos]] (potter signed), tondo of an Attic red-figure cup c. 470 BC, [[Musée du Louvre]].]]
When Zeus' wife [[Hera]] discovered that [[Leto]] was pregnant and that Zeus was the father, she banned Leto from giving birth on ''[[Solid Earth|terra firma]]''. In her wanderings, Leto found the newly created floating island of [[Delos]], which was neither mainland nor a real island. She gave birth there and was accepted by the people, offering them her promise that her son would be always favourable toward the city. Afterwards, Zeus secured Delos to the bottom of the ocean.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freese1911&quot;/&gt; This island later became sacred to Apollo.

It is also stated that Hera kidnapped [[Eileithyia]], the goddess of childbirth, to prevent Leto from going into labor. The other gods tricked Hera into letting her go by offering her a necklace of amber nine yards (8 m) long. Mythographers agree that [[Artemis]] was born first and subsequently assisted with the birth of Apollo, or that Artemis was born one day before Apollo on the island of [[Ortygia]] and that she helped Leto cross the sea to Delos the next day to give birth to Apollo. Apollo was born on the seventh day ({{lang|grc|ἑβδομαγενής}}, ''hebdomagenes'')&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|e(bdomagenh/s|ἑβδομαγενής|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of the month [[Attic calendar#Festival calendar|Thargelion]] —according to Delian tradition—or of the month [[Hellenic calendars#Delphic|Bysios]]—according to Delphian tradition. The seventh and twentieth, the days of the new and full moon, were ever afterwards held sacred to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freese1911&quot;/&gt;

===Youth===
Four days after his birth, Apollo killed the [[chthonic]] dragon [[Python (mythology)|Python]], which lived in [[Delphi]] beside the [[Castalian Spring]]. This was the spring which emitted vapors that caused the oracle at Delphi to give her prophecies. Hera sent the serpent to hunt Leto to her death across the world. To protect his mother, Apollo begged [[Hephaestus]] for a bow and arrows. After receiving them, Apollo cornered Python in the sacred cave at Delphi.&lt;ref&gt;''Children of the Gods'' by Kenneth McLeish, page 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo killed Python but had to be punished for it, since Python was a child of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]].

Hera then sent the giant [[Tityos]] to rape Leto. This time Apollo was aided by his sister Artemis in protecting their mother. During the battle Zeus finally relented his aid and hurled Tityos down to [[Tartarus]]. There, he was pegged to the rock floor, covering an area of {{convert|9|acre|m2}}, where a pair of [[vulture]]s feasted daily on his liver.

===Trojan War===

[[File:Marble Bust of Apollo.jpg|thumb|Marble Bust of Apollo after the [[Apollo Belvedere]]. Circa 1675]]

Apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the Greek encampment during the [[Trojan War]] in retribution for [[Agamemnon]]'s insult to [[Chryses]], a priest of Apollo whose daughter [[Chryseis]] had been captured. He demanded her return, and the Achaeans complied, indirectly causing the ''[[Achilles and Patroclus#In the Iliad|anger of Achilles]]'', which is the theme of the ''[[Iliad]]''.

In the Iliad, when [[Diomedes]] injured [[Aeneas]], Apollo rescued him. First, [[Aphrodite]] tried to rescue Aeneas but Diomedes injured her as well. Aeneas was then enveloped in a cloud by Apollo, who took him to Pergamos, a sacred spot in [[Troy]].

Apollo aided [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] in the killing of Achilles by guiding the arrow of his bow into [[Achilles]]' heel. One interpretation of his motive is that it was in revenge for Achilles' sacrilege in murdering [[Troilus]], the god's own son by [[Hecuba]], on the very [[Ancient Greek religion#Practices|altar]] of the god's own temple.

===Admetus===
When Zeus struck down Apollo's son Asclepius with a lightning bolt for resurrecting [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus]] from the dead (transgressing [[Themis]] by stealing [[Hades]]'s subjects), Apollo in revenge killed the [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]], who had fashioned the bolt for Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliothke]]'' iii. 10.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo would have been banished to [[Tartarus]] forever for this, but was instead sentenced to one year of [[Penal labour|hard labor]], due to the intercession of his mother, [[Leto]]. During this time he served as [[shepherd]] for [[Admetus|King Admetus]] of [[Pherae]] in [[Thessaly]]. Admetus treated Apollo well, and, in return, the god conferred great benefits on Admetus.

Apollo helped Admetus win [[Alcestis]], the daughter of [[Pelias|King Pelias]] and later convinced the [[Moirai|Fates]] to let Admetus live past his time, if another took his place. But when it came time for Admetus to die, his parents, whom he had assumed would gladly die for him, refused to cooperate. Instead, Alcestis took his place, but [[Heracles]] managed to &quot;''[[Coercion|persuade]]''&quot; [[Thanatos]], the god of death, to return her to the world of the living.

[[File:Niobe JacquesLouisDavid 1772 Dallas Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|250px|''Artemis and Apollo Piercing Niobe's Children with their Arrows'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]], [[Dallas Museum of Art]]]]

===Niobe===
[[Niobe]], the queen of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and wife of [[Amphion]], boasted of her superiority to Leto because she had fourteen children ([[Niobids]]), seven male and seven female, while Leto had only two. Apollo killed her sons, and Artemis her daughters. Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions of the myth, a number of the Niobids were spared ([[Chloris]], usually). Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, either killed himself or was killed by Apollo after swearing revenge.

A devastated Niobe fled to [[Spil Mount|Mount Sipylos]] in [[Asia Minor]] and turned into stone as she wept. Her tears formed the river [[Achelous]]. Zeus had turned all the people of Thebes to stone and so no one buried the Niobids until the ninth day after their death, when the gods themselves entombed them.

===Consorts and children===
Love affairs ascribed to Apollo are a late development in Greek mythology.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The love-stories themselves were not told until later.&quot; [[Karl Kerenyi]], ''The Gods of the Greeks'' 1951:140.&lt;/ref&gt; Their vivid anecdotal qualities have made some of them favorites of painters since the Renaissance, the result being that they stand out more prominently in the modern imagination.

====Female lovers====
{{Main|Apollo and Daphne}}

[[File:Apollo &amp; Daphne September 2a.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Apollo and Daphne]] by [[Bernini]] in the [[Galleria Borghese]]]]
[[Daphne]] was a [[nymph]], daughter of the [[Sea and river deity|river god]] [[Peneus]], who had scorned Apollo. The myth explains the connection of Apollo with δάφνη (''daphnē''), the [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] whose leaves his priestess employed at [[Delphi]].&lt;ref&gt;The ancient Daphne episode is noted in late narratives, notably in [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', in [[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'', 203 and by the fourth-century-CE teacher of rhetoric and Christian convert, [[Libanius]], in ''Narrationes''.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ovid]]'s [[Metamorphoses]], Phoebus Apollo chaffs [[Cupid]] for toying with a weapon more suited to a man, whereupon Cupid wounds him with a golden dart; simultaneously, however, Cupid shoots a leaden arrow into Daphne, causing her to be repulsed by Apollo. Following a spirited chase by Apollo, Daphne prays to her father Peneus for help and he changes her into the laurel tree, sacred to Apollo.

''Artemis Daphnaia'', who had her temple among the Lacedemonians, at a place called Hypsoi&lt;ref&gt;G. Shipley, &quot;The Extent of Spartan Territory in the Late Classical and Hellenistic Periods&quot;, ''The Annual of the British School at Athens'', 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; in Antiquity, on the slopes of Mount Cnacadion near the Spartan frontier,&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], 3.24.8 ([http://www.theoi.com/Text/Pausanias3B.html on-line text]); Lilius Gregorius Gyraldus, ''Historiae Deorum Gentilium'', Basel, 1548, Syntagma 10, is noted in this connection in [http://www.textlog.de/40739.html Benjamin Hederich, ''Gründliches mythologisches Lexikon'', 1770]&lt;/ref&gt; had her own sacred laurel trees.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Kerenyi]], ''The Gods of the Greeks'', 1951:141&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Eretria]] the identity of an excavated 7th- and 6th-century temple to ''Apollo Daphnephoros'', &quot;Apollo, laurel-bearer&quot;, or &quot;carrying off Daphne&quot;, a &quot;place where the citizens are to take the oath&quot;, is identified in inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Rufus B. Richardson, &quot;A Temple in Eretria&quot; ''The American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts'', '''10'''.3 (July - September 1895:326–337); Paul Auberson, ''Eretria. Fouilles et Recherches I, Temple d'Apollon Daphnéphoros, Architecture'' (Bern, 1968). See also [[Plutarch]], ''Pythian Oracle'', 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leucothea]] was daughter of [[Orchamus]] and sister of [[Clytia]]. She fell in love with Apollo who disguised himself as Leucothea's mother to gain entrance to her chambers. Clytia, jealous of her sister because she wanted Apollo for herself, told Orchamus the truth, betraying her sister's trust and confidence in her. Enraged, Orchamus ordered Leucothea to be buried alive. Apollo refused to forgive Clytia for betraying his beloved, and a grieving Clytia wilted and slowly died. Apollo changed her into an incense plant, either heliotrope or sunflower, which follows the sun every day.

[[Marpessa]] was kidnapped by [[Idas]] but was loved by Apollo as well. [[Zeus]] made her choose between them, and she chose Idas on the grounds that Apollo, being immortal, would tire of her when she grew old.

[[Castalia]] was a [[nymph]] whom Apollo loved. She fled from him and dove into the [[castalian Spring|spring]] at Delphi, at the base of [[Mt. Parnassos]], which was then named after her. Water from this spring was sacred; it was used to clean the Delphian temples and inspire the priestesses. In the last [[oracle]] is mentioned that the &quot;water which could speak&quot;, has been lost for ever.

By [[Cyrene (mythology)|Cyrene]], Apollo had a son named [[Aristaeus]], who became the patron god of cattle, [[fruit trees]], hunting, husbandry and [[bee-keeping]]. He was also a [[culture-hero]] and taught humanity dairy skills, the use of nets and traps in hunting, and how to cultivate olives.

[[Hecuba]] was the wife of King [[Priam]] of [[Troy]], and Apollo had a son with her named [[Troilus]]. An [[oracle]] prophesied that Troy would not be defeated as long as Troilus reached the age of twenty alive. He was ambushed and killed by [[Achilleus]].

[[Cassandra]], was daughter of Hecuba and Priam, and Troilus' half-sister. Apollo fell in love with Cassandra and promised her the gift of prophecy to seduce her, but she rejected him afterwards. Enraged, Apollo indeed gave her the ability to know the future, with a curse that she could only see the future tragedies and that no one would ever believe her.

[[Coronis (Greek mythology)|Coronis]], was daughter of [[Phlegyas]], King of the [[Lapiths]]. Pregnant with [[Asclepius]], Coronis fell in love with [[Ischys]], son of [[Elatus]]. A crow informed Apollo of the affair. When first informed he disbelieved the crow and turned all crows black (where they were previously white) as a punishment for spreading untruths. When he found out the truth he sent his sister, Artemis, to kill Coronis (in other stories, Apollo himself had killed Coronis). As a result, he also made the crow sacred and gave them the task of announcing important deaths. Apollo rescued the baby and gave it to the [[centaur]] [[Chiron]] to raise. Phlegyas was irate after the death of his daughter and burned the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. Apollo then killed him for what he did.

In [[Euripides]]' play ''[[Ion (play)|Ion]]'', Apollo fathered [[Ion (mythology)|Ion]] by [[Creusa (daughter of Erechtheus)|Creusa]], wife of [[Xuthus]]. Creusa left Ion to die in the wild, but Apollo asked [[Hermes]] to save the child and bring him to the oracle at [[Delphi]], where he was raised by a priestess.

[[Acantha]], was the spirit of the [[Acanthus (genus)|acanthus]] tree, and Apollo had one of his other liaisons with her. Upon her death, Apollo transformed her into a sun-loving herb.

According to the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Biblioteca]]'', the &quot;library&quot; of mythology mis-attributed to Apollodorus, he fathered the [[Corybantes]] on the Muse [[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]].&lt;ref&gt;Apollodorus, [http://www.theoi.com/Text/Apollodorus1.html ''Bibliotheca'', 1.3.4]. Other ancient sources, however, gave the Corybantes different parents; see [[James George Frazer|Sir James Frazer]]'s [http://www.theoi.com/Text/Ap1a.html#46 note] on the passage in the ''Bibliotheca''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Male lovers====
[[File:Hyacinthus.jpg|thumb|upright|''Apollo and Hyacinthus'', 16th-century Italian engraving by [[Jacopo Caraglio]]]]
[[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinth]] or Hyacinthus was one of Apollo's male lovers. He was a [[Sparta]]n prince, beautiful and athletic. The pair was practicing throwing the [[Discus throw|discus]] when a discus thrown by Apollo was blown off course by the jealous [[Zephyrus]] and struck Hyacinthus in the head, killing him instantly. Apollo is said to be filled with grief: out of Hyacinthus' blood, Apollo created a [[hyacinth (plant)|flower]] named after him as a memorial to his death, and his tears stained the flower petals with the interjection {{lang|grc|αἰαῖ}}, meaning ''alas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|ai)ai{{=}}|αἰαῖ}}, {{LSJ|ai)/2|αἴ|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Festival of Hyacinthus was a celebration of Sparta.

Another male lover was [[Cyparissus]], a descendant of [[Heracles]]. Apollo gave him a tame deer as a companion but Cyparissus accidentally killed it with a [[Pilum|javelin]] as it lay asleep in the undergrowth. Cyparissus asked Apollo to let his tears fall forever. Apollo granted the request by turning him into the [[Cupressaceae|Cypress]] named after him, which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk.

Other male lovers of Apollo include:
* [[Admetus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Callimachus]], Hymn to Apollo, 49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Plutarch, Numa&quot; /&gt;
* [[Atymnius]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Nonnus]], ''[[Dionysiaca]]'', 11. 258; 19. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise known as a beloved of [[Sarpedon]]
* [[Branchus]] (alternately, a son of Apollo)
* [[Carnus]]
* Clarus&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus]], ''Letters'', 5. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hippolytus of [[Sicyon]] (not the same as [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus, the son of Theseus]])&lt;ref name=&quot;Plutarch, Numa&quot;&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Numa'', 4. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hymenaios]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoninus Liberalis]], ''Metamorphoses'', 23.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Iapis]]
* Leucates, who threw himself off a rock when Apollo attempted to carry him off&lt;ref&gt;[[Servius]] on ''[[Aeneid]]'', 3. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Phorbas]] (probably the son of Triopas)&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Numa'', 4. 5, cf. also [[Hyginus]], ''Poetical Astronomy'', 2. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Potnieus&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement of Rome]], ''Homilia'', 5. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apollo's lyre===
[[File:Apollo Kitharoidos Antikensammlung Berlin 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Apollo with his [[lyre]]. Statue from [[Pergamon Museum]], Berlin.]]

[[Hermes]] was born on [[Mount Kyllini|Mount Cyllene]] in Arcadia. The story is told in the [[Homeric Hymn]] to [[Hermes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=English translation of the Homeric Hymn to Hermes|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0138%3Ahymn|website=Perseus|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]], had been secretly impregnated by [[Zeus]]. Maia wrapped the infant in blankets but Hermes escaped while she was asleep.

Hermes ran to [[Thessaly]], where Apollo was grazing his cattle. The infant Hermes stole a number of his cows and took them to a cave in the woods near [[Pylos]], covering their tracks. In the cave, he found a [[tortoise]] and killed it, then removed the insides. He used one of the cow's intestines and the tortoise shell and made the first [[lyre]].

Apollo complained to Maia that her son had stolen his cattle, but Hermes had already replaced himself in the blankets she had wrapped him in, so Maia refused to believe Apollo's claim. Zeus intervened and, claiming to have seen the events, sided with Apollo. Hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented. Apollo, a god of music, fell in love with the instrument and offered to allow exchange of the cattle for the lyre. Hence, Apollo then became a master of the lyre.

===Apollo in the ''Oresteia''===
In [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Oresteia]]'' trilogy, [[Clytemnestra]] kills her husband, King [[Agamemnon]] because he had sacrificed their daughter [[Iphigenia]] to proceed forward with the Trojan war, and [[Cassandra]], a prophetess of Apollo. Apollo gives an order through the Oracle at Delphi that Agamemnon's son, [[Orestes]], is to kill Clytemnestra and [[Aegisthus]], her lover. Orestes and Pylades carry out the revenge, and consequently Orestes is pursued by the [[Erinyes]] or Furies (female personifications of [[revenge|vengeance]]).

Apollo and the Furies argue about whether the [[matricide]] was justified; Apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and Orestes was avenging his father, whereas the Erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage. They invade his temple, and he says that the matter should be brought before Athena. Apollo promises to protect Orestes, as Orestes has become Apollo's supplicant. Apollo advocates Orestes at the trial, and ultimately Athena rules in favor of Apollo.

====Musical contests====

=====Pan=====
Once [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] had the audacity to compare his music with that of Apollo and to challenge Apollo, the god of the [[kithara]], the mountain-god [[Tmolus]] was chosen to umpire. Pan blew on his pipes, and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, [[Midas]], who happened to be present. Then Apollo struck the strings of his lyre. Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and all but Midas agreed with the judgment. He dissented and questioned the justice of the award. Apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer, and caused them to become the ears of a [[donkey]].

=====Marsyas=====
[[File:Marsyas_Istanbul_Archaeological_Museum_-_inv._400_T_01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marsyas]] under Apollo's punishment, [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums|İstanbul Archaeology Museum]]]]

Apollo has ominous aspects aside from his plague-bringing, death-dealing arrows: [[Marsyas]] was a [[satyr]] who challenged Apollo to a contest of music. He had found an [[aulos]] on the ground, tossed away after being invented by [[Athena]] because it made her cheeks puffy. The contest was judged by the [[Muse]]s.

After they each performed, both were deemed equal until Apollo decreed they play and sing at the same time. As Apollo played the [[lyre]], this was easy to do. Marsyas could not do this, as he only knew how to use the flute and could not sing at the same time. Apollo was declared the winner because of this. Apollo [[flaying|flayed]] Marsyas alive in a cave near [[Celaenae]] in [[Phrygia]] for his [[hubris]] to challenge a god. He then nailed Marsyas' shaggy skin to a nearby pine-tree. Marsyas' blood turned into the river [[Marsyas (river)|Marsyas]].

Another variation is that Apollo played his instrument (the lyre) upside down. Marsyas could not do this with his instrument (the [[flute]]), and so Apollo hung him from a tree and flayed him alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Man Myth and Magic'' by Richard Cavendish&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Cinyras=====

Apollo also had a [[lyre]]-playing contest with [[Cinyras]], his son, who committed suicide when he lost.

===Roman Apollo===

The Roman worship of Apollo was adopted from the Greeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freese1911&quot;/&gt; As a quintessentially [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek god]], Apollo had no direct Roman equivalent, although later Roman poets often referred to him as '''Phoebus'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Heroine/Koronis.html |title=Koronis |publisher=Theoi |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a tradition that the Delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the [[Roman Kingdom|kings of Rome]] during the reign of [[Tarquinius Superbus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Liv.+1.56 1.56].&lt;/ref&gt;

On the occasion of a pestilence in the 430s BCE, Apollo's [[Temple of Apollo Sosianus|first temple]] at Rome was established in the Flaminian fields, replacing an older cult site there known as the &quot;Apollinare&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Livy [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0026:book=3:chapter=63 3.63.7], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0145:book=4:chapter=25 4.25.3].&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Second Punic War]] in 212 BCE, the ''[[Ludi Apollinares]]'' (&quot;Apollonian Games&quot;) were instituted in his honor, on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one Marcius.&lt;ref&gt;Livy [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0147:book=25:chapter=12 25.12].&lt;/ref&gt; In the time of [[Augustus]], who considered himself under the special protection of Apollo and was even said to be his son, his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=J. H. W. G. Liebeschuetz |title=Continuity and Change in Roman Religion |year=1979 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-814822-4 |pages=82–85 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[battle of Actium]], which was fought near a sanctuary of Apollo, Augustus enlarged Apollo's temple, dedicated a portion of the spoils to him, and instituted [[quinquennial]] games in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars#Life of Augustus|Augustus]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#18.2 18.2]; [[Cassius Dio]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/51*.html#1 51.1.1–3].&lt;/ref&gt; He also erected [[Temple of Apollo (Palatine)|a new temple]] to the god on the [[Palatine Hill|Palatine hill]].&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/53*.html#1.3 53.1.3].&lt;/ref&gt; Sacrifices and prayers on the Palatine to Apollo and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] formed the culmination of the [[Secular Games]], held in 17 BCE to celebrate the dawn of a new era.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae]]'' 5050, translated by {{cite book |last1=Beard |first1=Mary |authorlink=Mary Beard (classicist) |last2=North |first2=John |last3=Price |first3=Simon |title=Religions of Rome: Volume 2: A Sourcebook |year=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-45015-2|page=5.7b }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals==
The chief Apollonian festivals were the [[Boedromia]], [[Carneia]], Carpiae, [[Daphnephoria]], [[Delia (festival)|Delia]], [[Hyacinthia]], [[Metageitnia]], [[Pyanepsia]], [[Pythia]] and [[Thargelia]].

==Attributes and symbols==

Apollo's most common attributes were the bow and [[arrow]]. Other attributes of his included the [[kithara]] (an advanced version of the common [[lyre]]), the [[plectrum]] and the sword. Another common emblem was the [[sacrificial tripod]], representing his prophetic powers. The [[Pythian Games]] were held in Apollo's honor every four years at [[Delphi]]. The [[bay laurel]] plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the [[laurel wreath|crown of victory]] at these games.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freese1911&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Ai-Khanoum-gold stater of Antiochos1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Gold stater of the [[Seleucid]] king [[Antiochus I Soter]] (reigned 281–261 BCE) showing on the reverse a nude Apollo holding his key attributes: two arrows and a bow]]

The [[palm tree]] was also sacred to Apollo because he had been born under one in [[Delos]]. Animals sacred to Apollo included [[wolf|wolves]], dolphins, [[roe deer]], [[swan]]s, [[cicada]]s (symbolizing music and song), [[hawk]]s, [[raven]]s, [[Corvus (genus)|crow]]s, snakes (referencing Apollo's function as the god of prophecy), mice and [[griffin]]s, mythical eagle–lion hybrids of Eastern origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freese1911&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Apolocitaredo8.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Apollo Citharoedus]]'' (&quot;Apollo with a kithara&quot;), [[Musei Capitolini]], Rome]]
As god of colonization,&lt;ref name=&quot;Freese1911&quot;/&gt; Apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies, especially during the height of colonization, 750–550 BCE. According to Greek tradition, he helped [[Crete|Cretan]] or [[Arcadia]]n colonists found the city of [[Troy]]. However, this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction: [[Hittites|Hittite]] [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] texts mention a Minor Asian god called ''Appaliunas'' or ''Apalunas'' in connection with the city of [[Wilusa]] attested in Hittite inscriptions, which is now generally regarded as being identical with the Greek [[Troy|Ilion]] by most scholars. In this interpretation, Apollo's title of ''Lykegenes'' can simply be read as &quot;born in Lycia&quot;, which effectively severs the god's supposed link with wolves (possibly a [[folk etymology]]).

In literary contexts, Apollo represents harmony, order, and reason—characteristics contrasted with those of [[Dionysus]], god of wine, who represents ecstasy and disorder. The contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives [[Apollonian and Dionysian]]. However, the Greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary: the two gods are brothers, and when Apollo at winter left for [[Hyperborea]], he would leave the Delphic oracle to Dionysus. This contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the [[Borghese Vase]].

Apollo is often associated with the [[Golden mean (philosophy)|Golden Mean]]. This is the Greek [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] of [[moderation]] and a [[virtue]] that opposes [[gluttony]].

==Apollo in the arts==
[[File:Apollo Saurocton Louvre.jpg|thumb|180px|The Louvre ''Apollo Sauroctonos'', Roman copy after [[Praxiteles]] (360 BC)]]
Apollo is a common theme in Greek and Roman art and also in the art of the [[Renaissance]]. The earliest Greek word for a statue is &quot;delight&quot; ({{lang|grc|ἄγαλμα}}, ''agalma''), and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision. Greek art puts into Apollo the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined. The sculptors derived this from observations on human beings, but they also embodied in concrete form, issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought.

The naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body that was essentially a religious activity. The muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the Greek desire for health, and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard Greek environment. The statues of Apollo embody beauty, balance and inspire awe before the beauty of the world.

The evolution of the Greek sculpture can be observed in his depictions from the almost static formal [[Kouros]] type in [[Archaic period in Greece|early archaic period]], to the representation of motion in a relative harmonious whole in [[Archaic period in Greece|late archaic period]]. In [[classical Greece]] the emphasis is not given to the illusive imaginative reality represented by the ideal forms, but to the analogies and the interaction of the members in the whole, a method created by [[Polykleitos]]. Finally [[Praxiteles]] seems to be released from any art and religious conformities, and his masterpieces are a mixture of [[Realism (arts)|naturalism]] with stylization.

===Art and Greek philosophy===
The evolution of the Greek art seems to go parallel with the Greek philosophical conceptions, which changed from the natural-philosophy of [[Thales]] to the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] theory of [[Pythagoras]]. Thales searched for a simple material-form directly perceptible by the senses, behind the appearances of things, and his theory is also related to the older [[animism]]. This was paralleled in sculpture by the absolute representation of vigorous life, through unnaturally simplified forms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Homann63&quot;&gt;E. Homann-Wedeking. Transl. J.R. Foster (1968). ''Art of the world. Archaic Greece'', Methuen &amp; Co Ltd. London, pp. 63–65, 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pythagoras believed that behind the appearance of things, there was the permanent principle of mathematics, and that the forms were based on a transcendental mathematical relation.&lt;ref name=&quot;C. M. Bowra 1957 p. 166&quot;/&gt; The forms on earth, are imperfect imitations ({{lang|grc|εἰκόνες}}, ''eikones'', &quot;images&quot;) of the celestial world of numbers. His ideas had a great influence on post-Archaic art. The Greek architects and sculptors were always trying to find the mathematical relation, that would lead to the esthetic perfection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carpenter55&quot;&gt;R. Carpenter (1975). ''The esthetic basis of Greek art''. Indiana University Press. pp. 55–58.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Aesthetic canon|canon]]).

In classical Greece, [[Anaxagoras]] asserted that a divine reason (mind) gave order to the seeds of the universe, and [[Plato]] extended the Greek belief of ''ideal forms'' to his metaphysical theory of ''forms'' (''ideai'', &quot;ideas&quot;). The forms on earth are imperfect duplicates of the intellectual celestial ideas. The Greek words ''oida'' ({{lang|grc|οἶδα}}, &quot;(I) know&quot;) and ''eidos'' ({{lang|grc|εἶδος}}, &quot;species&quot;), a thing seen, have the same root as the word ''idea'' ({{lang|grc|ἰδέα}}), a thing ἰδείν to see.&lt;ref&gt;”The same root of looking or seeing” . R. Carpenter (1975). ''The esthetic basis of Greek art''. Indiana University Press. p.107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=idea idea]&lt;/ref&gt; indicating how the Greek mind moved from the gift of the senses, to the principles beyond the senses. The artists in Plato's time moved away from his theories and art tends to be a mixture of naturalism with stylization. The Greek sculptors considered the senses more important, and the proportions were used to unite the sensible with the intellectual.

===Archaic sculpture===
[[File:KAMA Kouros Porte Sacrée.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Sacred Gate Kouros, marble (610–600 BC), [[Kerameikos|Kerameikos Archaeological Museum in Athens]]]]

[[Kouros]] (''male youth'') is the modern term given to those representations of standing male youths which first appear in the [[archaic period in Greece]]. This type served certain religious needs and was first proposed for what was previously thought to be depictions of ''Apollo''.&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Leonardos(1895). ''Archaelogiki Ephimeris'', Col 75, n 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lechat (1904). ''La sculpture Attic avant Phidias'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The first statues are certainly still and formal. The formality of their stance seems to be related with the [[Egypt]]ian precedent, but it was accepted for a good reason. The sculptors had a clear idea of what a young man is, and embodied the archaic smile of good manners, the firm and springy step, the balance of the body, dignity, and youthful happiness. When they tried to depict the most abiding qualities of men, it was because men had common roots with the unchanging gods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowra144&quot;&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957). ''The Greek experience'', pp. 144–152.&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of a standard recognizable type for a long time, is probably because nature gives preference in survival of a type which has long be adopted by the climatic conditions, and also due to the general Greek belief that nature expresses itself in ''ideal forms'' that can be imagined and represented.&lt;ref name=Carpenter55/&gt; These forms expressed immortality. Apollo was the immortal god of ''ideal balance and order''. His shrine in [[Delphi]], that he shared in winter with Dionysius had the inscriptions: {{lang|grc|γνῶθι σεαυτόν}} (gnōthi seautón=&quot;know thyself&quot;) and {{lang|grc|μηδὲν ἄγαν}} (''mēdén ágan'', &quot;nothing in excess&quot;), and {{lang|grc|ἐγγύα πάρα δ'ἄτη}} (eggýa pára d'atē, &quot;make a pledge and mischief is nigh&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;See {{LSJ|a)/th|ἄτη|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WLA metmuseum Marble statue of a kouros youth 2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|New York Kouros, Met. Mus. 32.11.1, marble (620–610 BC), [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
In the first large-scale depictions during the early archaic period (640–580 BC), the artists tried to draw one's attention to look into the interior of the face and the body which were not represented as lifeless masses, but as being full of life. The Greeks maintained, until late in their civilization, an almost [[animism|animistic]] idea that the statues are in some sense alive. This embodies the belief that the image was somehow the god or man himself.&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Bowra. ''The Greek experience'', p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; A fine example is the statue of the ''Sacred gate Kouros'' which was found at the cemetery of [[Dipylon]] in Athens ([[Dipylon]] [[Kouros]]). The statue is the &quot;thing in itself&quot;, and his slender face with the deep eyes express an intellectual eternity. According to the Greek tradition the [[Dipylon|Dipylon master]] was named [[Daedalus]], and in his statues the limbs were freed from the body, giving the impression that the statues could move. It is considered that he created also the ''New York kouros'', which is the oldest fully preserved statue of ''Kouros'' type, and seems to be the incarnation of the god himself.&lt;ref name=Homann63/&gt;

[[File:7262 - Piraeus Arch. Museum, Athens - The Piraeus Apollo - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 14 2009.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Piraeus Apollo]], archaic-style bronze, [[Archaeological Museum of Piraeus]]]]
The animistic idea as the representation of the imaginative reality, is sanctified in the [[Homeric]] poems and in Greek myths, in stories of the god [[Hephaestus]] ([[Phaistos]]) and the mythic [[Daedalus]] (the builder of the [[labyrinth]]) that made images which moved of their own accord. This kind of art goes back to the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] period, when its main theme was the representation of motion in a specific moment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schachermeyer242&quot;&gt;F. Schachermeyer (1964). ''Die Minoische Kultur des alten Creta'', Kohlhammer Stuttgart, pp. 242–244.&lt;/ref&gt; These free-standing statues were usually marble, but also the form rendered in limestone, bronze, ivory and terracotta.

The earliest examples of life-sized statues of Apollo, may be two figures from the [[Ionians|Ionic]] sanctuary on the island of [[Delos]]. Such statues were found across the Greek speaking world, the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of Apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of ''Apollo Ptoios'', [[Boeotia]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;J. Ducat (1971). ''Les Kouroi des Ptoion''.&lt;/ref&gt; The last stage in the development of the ''Kouros type'' is the late archaic period (520–485 BC), in which the Greek sculpture attained a full knowledge of human anatomy and used to create a relative harmonious whole. Ranking from the very few bronzes survived to us is the masterpiece bronze [[Piraeus Apollo]]. It was found in [[Piraeus]], the harbour of Athens. The statue originally held the bow in its left hand, and a cup of pouring libation in its right hand. It probably comes from north-eastern [[Peloponnesus]]. The emphasis is given in anatomy, and it is one of the first attempts to represent a kind of motion, and beauty relative to proportions, which appear mostly in post-Archaic art. The statue throws some light on an artistic centre which, with an independently developed harder, simpler and heavier style, restricts [[Ionia]]n influence in Athens. Finally, this is the germ from which the art of [[Polykleitos]] was to grow two or three generations later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Homann144&quot;&gt;Homann-Wedeking (1966). ''Art of the World. Archaic Greece'', pp. 144–150.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical sculpture===

[[File:Apollon de Mantoue Louvre MA689.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Apollo of the &quot;Mantoua type&quot;, marble Roman copy after a 5th-century BCE Greek original attributed to [[Polykleitos]], Musée du Louvre]]

At the beginning of the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]], it was considered that beauty in visible things as in everything else, consisted of symmetry and proportions. The artists tried also to represent motion in a specific moment ([[Myron]]), which may be considered as the reappearance of the dormant [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] element.&lt;ref name=Schachermeyer242/&gt; Anatomy and geometry are fused in one, and each does something to the other. The Greek sculptors tried to clarify it by looking for mathematical proportions, just as they sought some reality behind appearances. [[Polykleitos]] in his ''Canon'' wrote that beauty consists in the proportion not of the elements (materials), but of the parts, that is the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole. It seems that he was influenced by the theories of [[Pythagoras]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Each part (finger, palm, arm, etc.) transmitted its individual existence to the next, and then to the whole&quot; : ''Canon of [[Polykleitos]]'', also [[Plotinus]], ''Ennead'' I vi. i: Nigel Spivey (1997). ''Greek art'', Phaidon Press Ltd. London. pp. 290–294.&lt;/ref&gt;
The famous ''Apollo of Mantua'' and its variants are early forms of the [[Apollo Citharoedus]] statue type, in which the god holds the [[cithara]] in his left arm. The type is represented by [[neo-Attic]] Imperial Roman copies of the late 1st or early 2nd century, modelled upon a supposed Greek bronze original made in the second quarter of the 5th century BCE, in a style similar to works of [[Polykleitos]] but more archaic. The Apollo held the ''cythara'' against his extended left arm, of which in the Louvre example, a fragment of one twisting scrolling horn upright remains against his biceps.

Though the proportions were always important in Greek art, the appeal of the Greek sculptures eludes any explanation by proportion alone. The statues of Apollo were thought to incarnate his living presence, and these representations of illusive imaginative reality had deep roots in the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] period, and in the beliefs of the first [[Greek language|Greek]] speaking people who entered the region during the bronze-age. Just as the Greeks saw the mountains, forests, sea and rivers as inhabited by concrete beings, so nature in all of its manifestations possesses clear form, and the form of a work of art. Spiritual life is incorporated in matter, when it is given artistic form. Just as in the arts the Greeks sought some reality behind appearances, so in mathematics they sought permanent principles which could be applied wherever the conditions were the same. Artists and sculptors tried to find this ideal order in relation with mathematics, but they believed that this ideal order revealed itself not so much to the dispassionate intellect, as to the whole sentient self.&lt;ref name=Homann63/&gt; Things as we see them, and as they really are, are one, that each stresses the nature of the other in a single unity.

===Pediments and friezes===

[[File:Apollo west pediment Olympia copy MFA Munich.jpg|thumb|upright|Apollo, West Pediment Olympia. Munich, copy from original, 460 BCE at the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Temple of Zeus]], [[Olympia, Greece]].]]

In the archaic pediments and friezes of the temples, the artists had a problem to fit a group of figures into an isosceles triangle with acute angles at the base.

The [[Siphnian Treasury]] in [[Delphi]] was one of the first Greek buildings utilizing the solution to put the dominating form in the middle, and to complete the descending scale of height with other figures sitting or kneeling. The pediment shows the story of [[Heracles]] stealing Apollo's tripod that was strongly associated with his oracular inspiration. Their two figures hold the centre. In the pediment of the temple of [[Zeus]] in [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], the single figure of Apollo is dominating the scene.&lt;ref name=Bowra144/&gt;

[[File:Belvedere Apollo Pio-Clementino Inv1015 n3.jpg|175px|thumb|Head of the ''[[Apollo Belvedere]]'']]

These representations rely on presenting scenes directly to the eye for their own visible sake. They care for the schematic arrangements of bodies in space, but only as parts in a larger whole. While each scene has its own character and completeness it must fit into the general sequence to which it belongs. In these archaic pediments the sculptors use empty intervals, to suggest a passage to and from a busy battlefield. The artists seem to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order, and this was improved when classical art brought a greater freedom and economy.&lt;ref name=Bowra144/&gt;

===Hellenistic Greece-Rome===
Apollo as a handsome beardless young man, is often depicted with a [[kithara]] (as [[Apollo Citharoedus]]) or bow in his hand, or reclining on a tree (the [[Apollo Lykeios]] and [[Apollo Sauroctonos]] types). The [[Apollo Belvedere]] is a [[marble]] sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century; for centuries it epitomized the ideals of [[Classical Antiquity]] for Europeans, from the [[Renaissance]] through the 19th century. The marble is a [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] or Roman copy of a bronze original by the Greek sculptor [[Leochares]], made between 350 and 325 BCE.

The life-size so-called &quot;[[Adonis]]&quot; found in 1780 on the site of a ''[[Roman villa|villa suburbana]]'' near the [[Via Labicana]] in the Roman suburb of Centocelle is identified as an Apollo by modern scholars. In the late 2nd century CE floor mosaic from [[El Djem]], Roman ''Thysdrus'', he is identifiable as [[Helios|Apollo Helios]] by his effulgent [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], though now even a god's divine [[nudity|nakedness]] is concealed by his cloak, a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later [[Roman Empire|Empire]].

Another haloed Apollo in mosaic, from [[Hadrumentum]], is in the museum at [[Sousse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tunisiaonline.com/mosaics/mosaic05b.html |title=Mosaics in Tunisia: Apollo and the Muses |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=8 July 2008 |accessdate=30 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708143541/http://www.tunisiaonline.com/mosaics/mosaic05b.html |archivedate=8 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conventions of this representation, head tilted, lips slightly parted, large-eyed, curling [[Hairstyle|hair cut]] in locks grazing the neck, were developed in the 3rd century BCE to depict [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Bieber 1964, Yalouris 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Some time after this mosaic was executed, the earliest depictions of Christ would also be beardless and haloed.

==Modern reception==
Apollo has often featured in postclassical art and literature. [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] composed a &quot;Hymn of Apollo&quot; (1820), and the god's instruction of the Muses formed the subject of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Apollon musagète]]'' (1927–1928). In 1978, the Canadian band [[Rush (band)|Rush]] released [[Hemispheres (Rush album)|an album]] with songs [[Cygnus X-1 (song series)#Book II: Hemispheres|&quot;Apollo: Bringer of Wisdom&quot;/&quot;Dionysus: Bringer of Love&quot;]].

In discussion of the arts, a distinction is sometimes made between the [[Apollonian and Dionysian]] impulses where the former is concerned with imposing intellectual order and the latter with chaotic creativity. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] argued that a fusion of the two was most desirable. [[Carl Jung]]'s [[Apollo archetype]] represents what he saw as the disposition in people to over-intellectualise and maintain emotional distance.

[[Charles Handy]], in ''Gods of Management'' (1978) uses Greek gods as a metaphor to portray various types of [[organizational culture|organisational culture]]. Apollo represents a 'role' culture where order, reason and [[bureaucracy]] prevail.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Library]]: Management and Business Studies Portal, [https://mbsportal.bl.uk/taster/subjareas/busmanhist/mgmtthinkers/handy.aspx Charles Handy], accessed 12 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In spaceflight, the [[NASA]] program for landing astronauts on the Moon was named [[Apollo program|Apollo]].
