<text xml:space="preserve">'''Anaxarchus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|ə|ɡ|ˈ|z|ɑr|k|ə|s}}; {{lang-el|Ἀνάξαρχος}}; c. 380 – c. 320 BC) was a [[Greek people|Greek]] [[philosopher]] of the school of [[Democritus]]. Together with [[Pyrrho]], he accompanied [[Alexander the Great]] into Asia. The reports of his philosophical views suggest that he was a forerunner of [[Pyrrhonism]].

==Life==
Anaxarchus was born at [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] in [[Thrace]]. He was the companion and friend of [[Alexander the Great]] in his Asiatic campaigns. According to [[Diogenes Laertius]], in response to Alexander's claim to have been the son of Zeus-Ammon, Anaxarchus pointed to his bleeding wound and remarked, &quot;See the blood of a mortal, not [[ichor]], such as flows from the veins of the immortal gods.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;laertius60&quot;&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives'', ix. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plutarch]] tells a story that at [[Bactra]], in 327 BC in a debate with [[Callisthenes]], he advised all to worship Alexander as a god even during his lifetime, is with greater probability attributed to the Sicilian [[Cleon]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

When Alexander was trying to show that he is divine so that the Greeks and Macedonians would perform proskynesis to him, Anaxarchus said that Alexander could &quot;more justly be considered a god than Dionysus or Heracles&quot; (Arrian, 104)

Diogenes Laertius says that [[Nicocreon]], the tyrant of [[Cyprus]], commanded him to be pounded to death in a mortar, and that he endured this torture with fortitude and [[Cicero]] relates the same story.&lt;ref name=&quot;laertius58&quot;&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives'', ix. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Very little is known about his philosophical views. It is thought that he represents a link between the [[atomism]] of [[Democritus]], and the [[Pyrrhonism|skepticism]] of [[Pyrrho]].

Anaxarchus is said to have studied under [[Diogenes of Smyrna]], who in turn studied under [[Metrodorus of Chios]], who used to declare that he knew nothing, not even the fact that he knew nothing.&lt;ref name=&quot;laertius58&quot;/&gt; According to [[Sextus Empiricus]], Anaxarchus &quot;compared existing things to a scene-painting and supposed them to resemble the impressions experienced in sleep or madness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Against the Logicians'', 7.88.&lt;/ref&gt; Anaxarchus's student Pyrrho is said to have adopted &quot;a most noble philosophy,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. taking the form of agnosticism and suspension of judgement.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives'', ix. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Anaxarchus is said to have praised Pyrrho's &quot;indifference and sang-froid.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives'', ix. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Anaxarchus is said to have possessed &quot;fortitude and contentment in life,&quot; which earned him the epithet ''eudaimonikos'' (&quot;fortunate&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;laertius60&quot;/&gt; which may imply that he held the end of life to be ''[[eudaimonia]].''

[[Plutarch]] reports that he told [[Alexander the Great]] that there was an infinite number of worlds, causing the latter to become dejected because he had not yet conquered even one.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch's Morals&lt;/ref&gt;
