The United Nations [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm classification of world regions] places Azerbaijan in Western Asia; the [[CIA World Factbook]] places it mostly in Southwest Asia [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aj.html] and ''[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/Azerbaijan Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary]'' places it in both; [http://www.nationalgeographic.com/xpeditions/atlas/index.html?Parent=asia&amp;Rootmap=azerba&amp;Mode=d&amp;SubMode=w NationalGeographic.com], and ''[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/46781/Azerbaijan Encyclopædia Britannica]'' also place Georgia in Asia. Conversely, some sources place Azerbaijan in Europe such as [http://worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/eu.htm Worldatlas.com].&lt;/ref&gt; It is bound by the [[Caspian Sea]] to the east, [[Russia]] to the north, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to the northwest, [[Armenia]] to the west and [[Iran]] to the south. The [[exclave]] of [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]] is bound by [[Armenia]] to the north and east, [[Iran]] to the south and west, while having an 11&amp;nbsp;km border with [[Turkey]] in the north west.

The [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] proclaimed its independence in 1918 and became the first democratic state in the Muslim-oriented world. The country was incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1920 as the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Swietochowski Borderland&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The government, for its part, has shown an official commitment to Islam by building mosques and respecting Islamic values... Unofficial Islamic groups sought to use aspects of Islam to mobilize the population and establish the foundations for a future political struggle.... Unlike Turkey, Azerbaijan does not have the powerful ideological legacy of secularism... the conflict with Armenia has bred frustration that is increasingly being answered by a combined Islamic and nationalist sentiment, especially among younger people... All major political forces are committed to secularism and are based, if anything, on a nationalist agenda.

The [[Sasanian Empire]] turned [[Caucasian Albania]] into a [[vassal state]] in 252, while King [[Urnayr]] officially adopted Christianity as the state religion in the 4th century. Despite Sassanid rule, Albania remained an entity in the region until the 9th century, while fully subordinate to Sassanid Iran, and retained its monarchy. Despite being one of the chief vassals of the Sasanian emperor, the Albanian king had only a semblance of authority, and the Sasanian [[marzban]] (military governor) held most civil, religious, and military authority.

In the first half of the 7th century, Caucasian Albania, as a vassal of the Sasanians, came under nominal Muslim rule due to the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]. The [[Umayyad Caliphate]] repulsed both the Sasanians and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] from [[Transcaucasia]] and turned Caucasian Albania into a vassal state after Christian resistance led by King [[Javanshir]], was suppressed in 667. The power vacuum left by the decline of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] was filled by numerous local dynasties such as the [[Sallarid dynasty|Sallarids]], [[Sajid dynasty|Sajids]], [[Shaddadids]], [[Rawadid dynasty|Rawadids]] and [[Buyid dynasty|Buyids]]. At the beginning of the 11th century, the territory was gradually seized by waves of [[Oghuz Turks]] from [[Central Asia]]. The first of these Turkic dynasties established was the [[Seljuk Empire]], who entered the area now known as Azerbaijan by 1067.

The pre-Turkic population that lived on the territory of modern Azerbaijan spoke several Indo-European and Caucasian languages, among them [[Armenian language|Armenian]]&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Locally, the possessions of the subsequent Seljuk Empire were ruled by [[Eldiguzids]], technically vassals of the Seljuk sultans, but sometimes ''de facto'' rulers themselves. Under the Seljuks, local poets such as [[Nizami Ganjavi]] and [[Khaqani]] gave rise to a blossoming of [[Persian literature]] on the territory of present-day Azerbaijan.

The next ruling state, the [[Jalairid Sultanate]], was short-lived and fell as a conquest of [[Timur]].

The local dynasty of the [[Shirvanshah]]s became a [[vassal]] state of [[Timurid dynasty|Timur's Empire]], and assisted him in his war with the ruler of the [[Golden Horde]] [[Tokhtamysh]]. Following Timur's death, two independent and rival states emerged: [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Aq Qoyunlu]]. The Shirvanshahs returned, maintaining a high degree of autonomy as local rulers and vassals from 861, for numerous centuries to come. In 1501, the [[Safavid dynasty]] of Iran subdued the Shirvanshahs, and gained its possessions. In the course of the next century, the Safavids [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|converted the formerly Sunni population to Shia Islam]],&lt;ref&gt;

The Sunni Ottomans briefly managed to occupy parts of present-day Azerbaijan as a result of the [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1578-1590)|Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578-1590]]; by the early 17th century, they were ousted by Safavid Iranian ruler [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] (r. 1588-1629). In the wake of the demise of the Safavid Empire, Baku and its environs were briefly occupied by the Russians as a consequence of the [[Russo-Persian War (1722–23)|Russo-Persian War of 1722-1723]]. Despite brief intermissions such as these by Safavid Iran's neighboring rivals, the land of what is today Azerbaijan remained under Iranian rule from the earliest advent of the Safavids up to the course of the 19th century.

This region comprised a number of khanates of which the most important was ''Qarabagh'', with its capital at Shusha; Ganja, with its capital of the same name; Shirvan across the Kura, with its capital at Shamakhi; and to the north-west, on both banks of the Kura, Christian Georgia (Gurjistan), with its capital at Tiflis.

After incorporation of all Caucasian territories from Iran into Russia, the new border between the two was set at the [[Aras River]], which, upon the Soviet Union's disintegration, subsequently became part of the border between Iran and the Azerbaijan Republic.

Qajar Iran was forced to cede its Caucasian territories to Russia in the 19th century, which thus included the territory of the modern-day Azerbaijan Republic, while as a result of that cession, the [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani ethnic group]] is nowadays parted between two nations: Iran and Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;Swietochowski, Tadeusz.

On 13 October 1921, the Soviet republics of Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia signed an agreement with Turkey known as the [[Treaty of Kars]]. The previously independent [[Republic of Aras]] would also become the [[Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] within the Azerbaijan SSR by the treaty of Kars. On the other hand, Armenia was awarded the region of [[Syunik Province|Zangezur]] and Turkey agreed to return [[Gyumri]] (then known as Alexandropol).

During [[World War II]], Azerbaijan played a crucial role in the strategic energy policy of the Soviet Union, with 80 percent of the Soviet Union's oil on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] being supplied by Baku. By the Decree of the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]] in February 1942, the commitment of more than 500 workers and employees of the [[petroleum industry|oil industry]] of Azerbaijan were awarded orders and medals.

However, only 24 of the 8,350 rivers are greater than {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref name=&quot;GEO&quot;/&gt; All the rivers drain into the Caspian Sea in the east of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;GEO&quot;/&gt; The largest lake is [[Lake Sarysu|Sarysu]] (67&amp;nbsp;km²), and the longest river is [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kur]] (1,515&amp;nbsp;km), which is [[Transboundary river|transboundary]] with [[Armenia]]. Azerbaijan's four main islands in the Caspian Sea have a combined area of over thirty square kilometers.

Since the independence of Azerbaijan in 1991, the [[Politics of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani government]] has taken drastic measures to preserve the environment of Azerbaijan. But national protection of the environment started to truly improve after 2001 when the state budget increased due to new revenues provided by the [[Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline]]. Within four years protected areas doubled and now make up eight percent of the country's territory. Since 2001 the government has set up seven large reserves and almost doubled the sector of the budget earmarked for environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enrin.grida.no/htmls/azer/soe/ecology/html/ecology.html |title=Ecological problems in Azerbaijan |publisher=Enrin.grida.no |accessdate=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Azerbajiani landscape - Another version.jpg|thumb|The landscape of Khinalug valley.]]
Azerbaijan is home to a vast variety of landscapes. Over half of Azerbaijan's land mass consists of mountain ridges, crests, [[yaila]]s, and plateaus which rise up to hypsometric levels of 400–1000&amp;nbsp;meters (including the Middle and Lower lowlands), in some places (Talis, Jeyranchol-Ajinohur and Langabiz-Alat foreranges) up to 100–120&amp;nbsp;meters, and others from 0–50&amp;nbsp;meters and up ([[Qobustan, Absheron]]). The rest of Azerbaijan's terrain consist of plains and lowlands. Hypsometric marks within the Caucasus region vary from about −28&amp;nbsp;meters at the Caspian Sea shoreline up to 4,466&amp;nbsp;meters (Bazardüzü peak).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enrin.grida.no/htmls/azer/soe/ecology/html/ecologicalzones.html |title=Orography of Azerbaijan |publisher= United Nations Environment Programme |accessdate=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of climate in Azerbaijan is influenced particularly by cold [[arctic]] [[air mass]]es of Scandinavian [[anticyclone]], temperate of [[Siberia]]n anticyclone, and Central Asian anticyclone.&lt;ref name=&quot;CLIM&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title =Azerbaijan – Climate| publisher = Heydar Aliyev Foundation| url = http://www.azerbaijan.az/_Geography/_Climate/_climate_e.html| accessdate = 26 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijan's diverse landscape affects the ways air masses enter the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;CLIM&quot;/&gt; The Greater Caucasus protects the country from direct influences of cold air masses coming from the north. That leads to the formation of [[Subtropics|subtropical climate]] on most foothills and plains of the country. Meanwhile, plains and foothills are characterized by high [[Sunlight|solar radiation]] rates.

9 out of 11 existing [[Köppen climate classification|climate zones]] are present in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name=&quot;KL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate |work=Water Resources of the Azerbaijan Republic |publisher=Institute of Hydrometeorology, Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources |url=http://www.azhydromet.com/SRIH/Water%20Resurs.html |accessdate=26 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524005453/http://www.azhydromet.com/SRIH/Water%20Resurs.html |archivedate=24 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the absolute minimum temperature (&lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt; {{convert|-33|°C|°F|1|disp=or}} &lt;/span&gt;) and the absolute maximum temperature (&lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt; {{convert|46|°C|°F|1|disp=or}} &lt;/span&gt;) were observed in [[Julfa Rayon|Julfa]] and [[Ordubad Rayon|Ordubad]] – regions of [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;KL&quot;/&gt; The maximum annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] falls in [[Lankaran]] ({{convert|1600|to|1800|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and the minimum in Absheron ({{convert|200|to|350|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;KL&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Murov mountain in Azerbaijan-Caucasus3.jpg|thumb|left|[[Murovdag]] is the highest [[mountain range]] in the [[Lesser Caucasus]].]]
Rivers and lakes form the principal part of the water systems of Azerbaijan, they were formed over a long geological timeframe and changed significantly throughout that period (what period would that be??). This is particularly evidenced by remnants of ancient rivers found throughout the country. The country's water systems are continually changing under the influence of natural forces and human introduced industrial activities. Artificial rivers (canals) and ponds are a part of Azerbaijan's water systems. In terms of water supply, Azerbaijan is below the average in the world with approximately {{convert|100000|m3|0|abbr=off}} per year of water per square kilometer.&lt;ref name=&quot;KL&quot;/&gt; All big [[Reservoir|water reservoirs]] are built on Kur. The hydrography of Azerbaijan basically belongs to the [[Caspian Sea basin]].

There are 8,350 rivers of various lengths within Azerbaijan. Only 24 rivers are over 100&amp;nbsp;kilometers long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Azerbaijan: Geography| publisher = Central Asia and Caucasus Institute| url = http://www.cac-biodiversity.org/aze/aze_geography.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura]] and [[Aras River|Aras]] are the major rivers in Azerbaijan, they run through the [[Kura-Aras Lowland]]. The rivers that directly flow into the Caspian Sea, originate mainly from the north-eastern slope of the Major Caucasus and [[Talysh Mountains]] and run along the Samur–Devechi and Lankaran lowlands.

[[Yanar Dag]], translated as &quot;burning mountain&quot;, is a natural gas fire which blazes continuously on a hillside on the [[Absheron Peninsula]] on the [[Caspian Sea]] near [[Baku]], which itself is known as the &quot;land of fire.&quot; Flames jet out into the air from a thin, porous sandstone layer. It is a tourist attraction to visitors to the Baku area.

[[File:Stamp of Azerbaijan 750.jpg|thumb|The [[Karabakh horse]] is the national animal of Azerbaijan.]]
The first reports on the richness and diversity of animal life in Azerbaijan can be found in travel notes of Eastern travelers. Animal carvings on architectural monuments, ancient rocks and stones survived up to the present times. The first information on the flora and fauna of Azerbaijan was collected during the visits of naturalists to Azerbaijan in the 17th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;GEO&quot;/&gt;

There are 106 species of mammals, 97 species of fish, 363 species of birds, 10 species of amphibians and 52 species of reptiles which have been recorded and classified in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name=&quot;GEO&quot;/&gt; The national animal of Azerbaijan is the [[Karabakh horse]], a mountain-steppe racing and riding horse endemic to Azerbaijan. The Karabakh horse has a reputation for its good temper, speed, elegance and intelligence. It is one of the oldest breeds, with ancestry dating to the ancient world. However, today the horse is an endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =The Karabakh Horse | publisher = Karabakh Foundation| url = http://www.karabakhfoundation.org/pages/history-and-culture/karabakh-region/the-karabakh-horse/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azerbaijan's flora consists of more than 4,500 species of [[higher plants]]. Due to the unique climate in Azerbaijan, the flora is much richer in the number of species than the flora of the other republics of the South Caucasus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azerbaijan.az/_Geography/_Planting/_planting_e.html |title=Azerbaijan – Flora |publisher=Heydar Aliyev Foundation|accessdate=5 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 67 percent of the species growing in the whole [[Caucasus]] can be found in Azerbaijan.

The structural formation of Azerbaijan's political system was completed by the adoption of the new [[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]] on 12 November 1995. According to Article 23 of the Constitution, the [[National symbol|state symbols]] of the Azerbaijan Republic are the [[Flag of Azerbaijan|flag]], the [[Coat of arms of Azerbaijan|coat of arms]], and the [[National Anthem of the Republic of Azerbaijan|national anthem]]. The state power in Azerbaijan is limited only by law for internal issues, but for international affairs is additionally limited by the provisions of international agreements.

The government of Azerbaijan is based on the [[separation of powers]] among the [[Legislature|legislative]], executive, and [[Judiciary|judicial]] branches. The legislative power is held by the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan|National Assembly]] and the Supreme National Assembly in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. Parliamentary elections are held every five years, on the first Sunday of November. The [[New Azerbaijan Party|Yeni Azerbaijan Party]], and independents loyal to the ruling government, currently hold almost all of the Parliament's 125 seats. During the [[Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2010|2010 Parliamentary election]], the opposition parties, [[Musavat]] and [[Azerbaijani Popular Front Party]], failed to win a single seat. European observers [[Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2010#Campaign irregularities|found numerous irregularities]] in the run-up to the election and [[Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2010#Election|on election day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Monitors criticize Azerbaijani elections |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/11/2010118152810836488.html |accessdate=8 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111072636/http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/11/2010118152810836488.html |archivedate=11 November 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The executive power is held by the [[President of Azerbaijan|president]], who is elected for a seven-year term by direct elections, and the [[Prime Minister of Azerbaijan|prime minister]]. The president is authorized to form the Cabinet, a collective executive body, accountable to both the president and the National Assembly. The Cabinet of Azerbaijan consists primarily of the prime minister, his deputies, and ministers. The president does not have the right to dissolve the National Assembly, but he has the right to veto its decisions. To override the presidential veto, the parliament must have a majority of 95 votes. The judicial power is vested in the [[Constitutional Court of Azerbaijan|Constitutional Court]], [[Supreme Court of Azerbaijan|Supreme Court]], and the [[Economic Court of Azerbaijan|Economic Court]]. The president nominates the judges in these courts. The [[European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice]] (CEPEJ) report refers to the Azerbaijani justice model on the selection of new judges as best practice that reflects the particular features and the course of development towards ensuring the independence and quality of the judiciary in a new democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?p=&amp;Ref=CEPEJ-COOP(2011)1&amp;Language=lanEnglish&amp;Ver=original&amp;BackColorInternet=DBDCF2&amp;BackColorIntranet=FDC864&amp;BackColorLogged=FDC864&amp;direct=true|title=Efficiency of justice – CEPEJ – European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ) – Report requested by the Ministry of Justice of Azerbaijan – Assessment of policy and procedures for the selection of judges in Azerbaijan – prepared by Mr Audun Hognes BERG, Head of International Secretariat, Norwegian Courts Administration, CEPEJ Bureau member and Ms Ivana GORANIĆ, Director of the Judicial Academy, Republic of Croatia, Representative of the Lisbon Network to the CEPEJ|last=CEPEJ|first=Council of Europe, Human Rights and Rule of Law, Efficiency of justice -|website=wcd.coe.int|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jean|first=Jean – Paul|year=2015|title=High quality justice for all member states of the Council of Europe|url=https://www.coe.int/t/dghl/cooperation/cepej/textes/CEPEJ_Study22_EN.pdf|journal=Council of Europe|volume=|page=119|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Security Council is the deliberative body under the president, and he organizes it according to the Constitution. It was established on 10 April 1997. The administrative department is not a part of the president's office but manages the financial, technical and pecuniary activities of both the president and his office.

Although Azerbaijan has held several elections since regaining its independence and it has many of the formal institutions of democracy, it remains classified as &quot;not free&quot; (on border with &quot;partly free&quot;) by [[Freedom House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Azerbaijan – Freedom House | publisher = FreedomHouse.org | url =http://www.freedomhouse.org/country/azerbaijan| accessdate = 4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;frh&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title =Combined Average Ratings: Independent Countries 2009 | publisher = FreedomHouse.org| year =2009 | url = http://old.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=475&amp;year=2009| accessdate = 10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, large numbers of Azerbaijani journalists, bloggers, lawyers, and human rights activists have been rounded up and jailed for their criticism of President Aliyev and government authorities.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/jailed-without-trial-in-azerbaijan/2015/03/01/34a1d342-bea1-11e4-bdfa-b8e8f594e6ee_story.html Jailed without trial in Azerbaijan],&quot; ''[[The Washington Post]]''. 1 March 2015.

&lt;/ref&gt; The banking system of Azerbaijan consists of the [[Central Bank of Azerbaijan]], [[commercial bank]]s and non-banking credit organizations. The National (now Central) Bank was created in 1992 based on the Azerbaijan State Savings Bank, an affiliate of the former State Savings Bank of the USSR. The Central Bank serves as Azerbaijan's central bank, empowered to issue the national currency, the [[Azerbaijani manat]], and to supervise all commercial banks. Two major commercial banks are [[UniBank (Azerbaijan)|UniBank]] and the state-owned [[International Bank of Azerbaijan]], run by [[Jahangir Hajiyev|Dr. Jahangir Hajiyev]].

It was not until the 2000s that the tourism industry began to recover, and the country has since experienced a high rate of growth in the number of tourist visits and overnight stays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/388501.html Azərbaycan Qarabağın turizm imkanlarını təbliğ edir] {{az icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the recent years, Azerbaijan has also become a popular destination for religious, spa, and health care tourism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baku Boom Has Yet to Hit Regions&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Ismayilov |first=Rovshan |authorlink= |title=Azerbaijan: Baku Boom Has Yet to Hit Regions |work= |publisher=EurasiaNet |url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav081307.shtml |doi= |accessdate=12 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819211953/http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav081307.shtml |archivedate=19 August 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; During winter, the [[Shahdag Mountain Resort]] offers skiing with state of the art facilities.

The [[government of Azerbaijan]] has set the development of Azerbaijan as an elite tourist destination as a top priority. It is a national strategy to make tourism a major, if not the single largest, contributor to the Azerbaijani economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism.az/?menu=1&amp;submenu=12&amp;lang=eng |title=Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Azerbaijan: Goals |publisher=Tourism.az |date=6 February 2004 |accessdate=4 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128233315/http://tourism.az/?menu=1&amp;submenu=12&amp;lang=eng |archivedate=28 November 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; These activities are regulated by the [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Azerbaijan)|Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Azerbaijan]].

===Transportation===
{{Main article|Transportation in Azerbaijan|Rail transport in Azerbaijan}}
The convenient location of Azerbaijan on the crossroad of major international traffic arteries, such as the [[Silk Road]] and the south–north corridor, highlights the strategic importance of transportation sector for the country's economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ziyadov |first=Taleh |title=The New Silk Roads |publisher=Central Asia-Caucasus Institute Silk Road Studies Program |url=http://www.silkroadstudies.org/new/docs/publications/GCA/GCAPUB-10.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725084438/http://www.silkroadstudies.org/new/docs/publications/GCA/GCAPUB-10.pdf |archivedate=25 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transport sector in the country includes roads, railways, aviation, and maritime transport.

Azerbaijan is also an important economic hub in the transportation of raw materials. The [[Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline]] (BTC) became operational in May 2006 and extends more than 1,774&amp;nbsp;kilometers through the territories of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey. The BTC is designed to transport up to 50&amp;nbsp;million tons of crude oil annually and carries oil from the Caspian Sea oilfields to global markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=The Central Asia-Caucasus Institute, Silk Road Studies Program |author=[[Zeyno Baran]] |title=The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline: Implications for Turkey |url=http://www.silkroadstudies.org/BTC_6.pdf |journal=The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline: Oil Window to the West |pages=103–118 |format=PDF |year=2005 |accessdate=30 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227022300/http://www.silkroadstudies.org/BTC_6.pdf |archivedate=27 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[South Caucasus Pipeline]], also stretching through the territory of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, became operational at the end of 2006 and offers additional gas supplies to the European market from the [[Shah Deniz gas field]]. Shah Deniz is expected to produce up to 296&amp;nbsp;billion cubic meters of natural gas per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=SCP Commissioning Commences |publisher=[[BP]] |url=http://www.bp.com/genericarticle.do?categoryId=9006615&amp;contentId=7018471 |date=1 June 2006 |accessdate=4 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011104709/http://www.bp.com/genericarticle.do?categoryId=9006615&amp;contentId=7018471 |archivedate=11 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijan also plays a major role in the EU-sponsored Silk Road Project.

In 2002, the Azerbaijani government established the Ministry of Transport with a broad range of policy and regulatory functions. In the same year, the country became a member of the [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cracowrent.pl/uploads/pliki/CP_Vienna_convention.pdf |title=List of Contracting Parties to the Convention on Road Traffic |publisher=UN Economic Commission for Europe |accessdate=23 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yt7JypD2?url=http://cracowrent.pl/uploads/pliki/CP_Vienna_convention.pdf |archivedate=23 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest priority being; upgrading the transport network and transforming transportation services into one of the key comparative advantages of the country, as this would be highly conducive to the development of other sectors of the economy.

In 2012, the construction of [[Kars–Tbilisi–Baku railway]] expected to provide transportation between Asia and Europe through connecting the railways of China and Kazakhstan in the east with Turkey's [[Marmaray]] to the European railway system in the west. [[Russian gauge|Broad-gauge]] railways in 2010 stretched for {{convert|2918|km|0|abbr=on}} and electrified railways numbered {{convert|1278|km|0|abbr=on}}.

In the 21st century, a new oil and gas boom helped to improve the situation in Azerbaijan's science and technology sectors, and the government launched a campaign aimed at modernization and [[List of Azerbaijani inventions and discoveries|innovation]]. The government estimates that profits from the information technology and communication industry will grow and become comparable with those from oil production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Azerbaijan aims for hi-tech state|url=http://www.euronews.net/2010/11/26/azerbaijan-aims-for-hi-tech-state/|publisher=[[Euronews]]|accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azerbaijan has a large and steadily growing Internet sector, mostly uninfluenced by the [[2007–2012 global financial crisis|global financial crisis]]; rapid growth is forecast for at least five more years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan is in TOP 10 of countries showing dynamic growth in Internet and mobile communications penetration|url=http://www.bakutel.az/2012/?p=news__read&amp;t=top&amp;q=55&amp;l=en|work=bakutel.az|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country has also been making progress in developing its telecoms sector. The Ministry of Communications &amp; Information Technologies (MCIT), as well as being an operator through its role in Aztelekom, is both a policy-maker and regulator. Public pay phones are available for local calls and require the purchase of a token from the telephone exchange or some shops and kiosks. Tokens allow a call of indefinite duration. {{As of|2009}}, there were 1,397,000 main telephone lines&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2150rank.html CIA.gov], CIA World Factbook Telephones – main lines in use, Azerbaijan 1,397,000 main lines&lt;/ref&gt; and 1,485,000 internet users.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2153rank.html CIA.gov], CIA World Factbook Internet users, Azerbaijan Internet users: 1,485,000.&lt;/ref&gt; There are four [[GSM]] providers: [[Azercell]], [[Bakcell]], Azerfon ([[Nar Mobile]]), [[Nakhtel]] mobile network operators and one [[CDMA]].

[[File:Dunya1.jpg|thumb|right|Classroom in [[Khazar University|Dunya School]]]]
A relatively high percentage of Azerbaijanis have obtained some form of higher education, most notably in scientific and technical subjects.&lt;ref name=&quot;AZ study&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title =Azerbaijan: A Country Study, Education, Health, and Welfare | publisher = Country Studies| url = http://countrystudies.us/azerbaijan/23.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Soviet era, literacy and average education levels rose dramatically from their very low starting point, despite two changes in the standard alphabet, from [[Perso-Arabic script]] to [[Latin script|Latin]] in the 1920s and from Roman to [[Cyrillic]] in the 1930s. According to Soviet data, 100 percent of males and females (ages nine to forty-nine) were literate in 1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;AZ study&quot;/&gt; According to the [[United Nations Development Program]] Report 2009, the literacy rate in Azerbaijan is 99.5 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Human Development Report 2009 | publisher = United Nations Development Program 2009| url = http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2009_EN_Complete.pdf| format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial alterations have included the reestablishment of religious education (banned during the Soviet period) and curriculum changes that have reemphasized the use of the Azerbaijani language and have eliminated ideological content. In addition to elementary schools, the education institutions include thousands of preschools, general secondary schools, and [[vocational schools]], including specialized secondary schools and technical schools. Education through the eighth grade is compulsory.

The culture of Azerbaijan has developed as a result of many influences. Today, national traditions are well preserved in the country despite Western influences, including [[globalization|globalized]] consumer culture. Some of the main elements of the Azerbaijani culture are: music, literature, folk dances and art, cuisine, architecture, cinematography and [[Novruz in Azerbaijan|Novruz Bayram]]. The latter is derived from the traditional celebration of the New Year in the ancient Iranian religion of [[Zoroastrianism]]. Novruz is a family holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Waters| first = Zena| title =What exactly is Novruz Bayram | publisher = Azerbaijan Today| url = http://www.azerbaijantoday.az/ARCHIVE/12/life1.html| accessdate = 22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The profile of Azerbaijan's population consists, as stated above, of Azerbaijanis, as well as other nationalities or ethnic groups, compactly living in various areas of the country. Azerbaijani national and traditional dresses are the [[Chokha]] and [[Papakhi]]. There are radio broadcasts in Russian, [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Lezgian language|Lezgian]] and [[Talysh language|Talysh]] languages, which are financed from the state budget.&lt;ref name=&quot;MIN&quot;/&gt; Some local radio stations in [[Balakən|Balakan]] and [[Khachmaz (city)|Khachmaz]] organize broadcasts in [[Avar language|Avar]] and [[Tat language (Caucasus)|Tat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MIN&quot;/&gt; In Baku several newspapers are published in Russian, Kurdish (''Dengi Kurd''), Lezgian (''Samur'') and Talysh languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;MIN&quot;/&gt; Jewish society &quot;Sokhnut&quot; publishes the newspaper ''Aziz''.&lt;ref name=&quot;MIN&quot;/&gt;

[[Mugham]], [[meykhana]] and [[Art of Azerbaijani ashiqs|ashiq art]] are among the many musical traditions of Azerbaijan. Mugham is usually a suite with poetry and instrumental interludes. When performing mugham, the singers have to transform their emotions into singing and music. In contrast to the mugham traditions of Central Asian countries, Azerbaijani mugham is more free-form and less rigid; it is often compared to the improvised field of [[jazz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duncan |first=Ishhad |title=The Baku Jazz Festival: Reviving a Tradition in Azerbaijan |publisher=EurasiaNet |url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/civilsociety/articles/eav042805.shtml |accessdate=27 April 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050508164545/http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/civilsociety/articles/eav042805.shtml |archivedate=8 May 2005 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] proclaimed the Azerbaijani mugham tradition a [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] on 7 November 2003. Meykhana is a kind of traditional Azerbaijani distinctive folk unaccompanied song, usually performed by several people improvising on a particular subject.

Ashiq combines poetry, storytelling, dance and vocal and instrumental music into a traditional performance art that stands as a symbol of Azerbaijani culture. It is a mystic troubadour or traveling bard who sings and plays the [[baglama|saz]]. This tradition has its origin in the [[Shamanistic]] beliefs of ancient [[Turkic peoples]].&lt;ref name=&quot;European University Institute, Florence, Italy&quot;&gt;[http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/paksoy-6/cae05.html &quot;ashik, shaman&quot;] – ''European University Institute, Florence, Italy'' (retrieved 10 August 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Ashiqs' songs are semi-improvised around common bases.

Since the mid-1960s, Western-influenced [[Azerbaijani pop music]], in its various forms, that has been growing in popularity in Azerbaijan, while genres such as [[Azerbaijani rock|rock]] and [[Azerbaijani hip hop|hip hop]] are widely produced and enjoyed.

There are dozens of Azerbaijani [[folk dance]]s. They are performed at formal celebrations and the dancers wear national clothes like the [[Chokha]], which is well-preserved within the national dances. Most dances have a very fast rhythm. The national dance shows the characteristics of the Azerbaijani nation.

The [[Book of Dede Korkut]] consists of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century,&lt;ref name=&quot;Meeker&quot;&gt;Michael E. Meeker, &quot;The Dede Korkut Ethic&quot;, International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 24, No. 3 (Aug. 1992), 395–417. excerpt: The Book of Dede Korkut is an early record of oral Turkic folktales in Anatolia, and as such, one of the mythic charters of Turkish nationalist ideology. The oldest versions of the Book of Dede Korkut consist of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century. The twelve stories that are recorded in these manuscripts are believed to be derived from a cycle of stories and songs circulating among Turkic peoples living in northeastern Anatolia and northwestern Azerbaijan. According to Lewis (1974), an older substratum of these oral traditions dates to conflicts between the ancient Oghuz and their Turkish rivals in Central Asia (the Pecheneks and the Kipchaks), but this substratum has been clothed in references to the 14th-century campaigns of the Akkoyunlu Confederation of Turkic tribes against the Georgians, the Abkhaz, and the Greeks in Trebizond. Such stories and songs would have emerged no earlier than the beginning of the 13th century, and the written versions that have reached us would have been composed no later than the beginning of the 15th century. By this time, the Turkic peoples in question had been in touch with Islamic civilization for several centuries, had come to call themselves &quot;Turcoman&quot; rather than &quot;Oghuz,&quot; had close associations with sedentary and urbanized societies, and were participating in Islamized regimes that included nomads, farmers, and townsmen. Some had abandoned their nomadic way of life altogether.&lt;/ref&gt; was not written earlier than the 15th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kafadar&quot;&gt;Cemal Kafadar(1995), &quot;in Between Two Worlds: Construction of the Ottoman states&quot;, University of California Press, 1995. Excerpt: &quot;It was not earlier than the fifteenth century. Based on the fact that the author is buttering up both the Akkoyunlu and Ottoman rulers, it has been suggested that the composition belongs to someone living in the undefined border region lands between the two states during the reign of Uzun Hassan (1466–78). G. Lewis on the hand dates the composition &quot;fairly early in the 15th century at least.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IranicaOguzKhan&quot;&gt;İlker Evrım Bınbaş, Encyclopædia Iranica, &quot;Oguz Khan Narratives&quot; [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/oguz-khan-narratives Encyclopædia Iranica | Articles].

Benefiting immensely from the fine literary traditions of his environment, and building upon the legacy of his predecessors, Fizuli was destined to become the leading literary figure of his society. His major works include ''The Divan of Ghazals'' and ''The Qasidas''. In the same century, Azerbaijani literature further flourished with the development of [[Ashik]] ({{lang-az|Aşıq}}) poetic genre of bards. During the same period, under the pen-name of Khatāī ({{lang-ar|خطائی}} for ''sinner'') Shah Ismail I wrote about 1400 verses in Azerbaijani,&lt;ref name=&quot;minorsky1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Minorsky |first=Vladimir |year=1942 |title=The Poetry of Shah Ismail |journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London |volume=10 |issue=4 |page=1053 |url= |quote= |doi=10.1017/S0041977X00090182 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which were later published as his ''Divan''. A unique literary style known as ''qoshma'' ({{lang-az|qoşma}} for ''improvization'') was introduced in this period, and developed by Shah Ismail and later by his son and successor, Shah [[Tahmasp I]].

In the span of the 17th and 18th centuries, Fizuli's unique genres as well [[Ashik]] poetry were taken up by prominent poets and writers such as [[Qovsi of Tabriz]], [[Abbas II of Iran|Shah Abbas Sani]], [[Agha Mesih Shirvani]], [[Nishat (poet)|Nishat]], [[Molla Vali Vidadi]], [[Molla Panah Vagif]], [[Amani (poet)|Amani]], [[Zafar (poet)|Zafar]] and others.

Modern literature in Azerbaijan is based on the Shirvani dialect mainly, while in Iran it is based on the Tabrizi one. The first newspaper in Azerbaijani, ''[[Akinchi]]'' was published in 1875. In the mid-19th century, it was taught in the schools of [[Baku]], [[Ganja (city)|Ganja]], [[Shaki, Azerbaijan|Shaki]], [[Tbilisi]], and [[Yerevan]]. Since 1845, it has also been taught in the [[University of Saint Petersburg]] in Russia.

===Folk art===

[[File:Azerbaijan tradition.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Traditional Azerbaijani clothing and musical instruments.]]
Azerbaijanis have a rich and distinctive culture, a major part of which is [[decorative art|decorative]] and [[applied art]]. This form of art is represented by a wide range of handicrafts, such as chasing, jeweler, engraving in metal, carving in wood, stone and bone, carpet-making, lasing, pattern weaving and printing, knitting and embroidery. Each of these types of decorative art, evidence of the endowments of the Azerbaijan nation, is very much in favor here. Many interesting facts pertaining to the development of arts and crafts in Azerbaijan were reported by numerous merchants, travelers and diplomats who had visited these places at different times.

The [[Azerbaijani rug|Azerbaijani carpet]] is a traditional handmade textile of various sizes, with dense texture and a pile or pile-less surface, whose patterns are characteristic of Azerbaijan's many carpet-making regions. In November 2010 the Azerbaijani carpet was proclaimed a [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of Intangible Heritage]] by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=00389 |title=The traditional art of Azerbaijani carpet weaving in the Republic of Azerbaijan |publisher=Unesco.org |accessdate=4 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205005739/http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=00389 |archivedate=5 December 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=134436 |title=Azerbaijani carpet entered UNESCO List of Intangible Cultural Heritage |publisher=Azerbaijan Press Agency |accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lahic folk art.png|thumb|left|Handwork coppery in [[Lahıc, Ismailli|Lahic]].]]
Azerbaijan has been since the ancient times known as a center of a large variety of crafts. The archeological dig on the territory of Azerbaijan testifies to the well developed agriculture, stock raising, metal working, pottery, ceramics, and carpet-weaving that date as far back as to the 2nd millennium BC. Archeological sites in Dashbulaq, Hasansu, Zayamchai, and Tovuzchai uncovered from the BTC pipeline have revealed early Iron Age artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agt.si.edu/site_overviews/azerbaijan/zayam_tovuz_artifact_catalogue.html|title=Ancient Heritage of the BTC – SCP Pipeline Corridor|website=Smithsonian|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azerbaijani carpets can be categorized under several large groups and a multitude of subgroups. Scientific research of the Azerbaijani carpet is connected with the name of [[Latif Kerimov]], a prominent scientist and artist. It was his classification that related the four large groups of carpets with the four geographical zones of Azerbaijan, Guba-Shirvan, Ganja-Kazakh, Karabakh and Tabriz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Educación, la Ciencia y la Cultura | publisher = [[UNESCO]] | url = http://portal.unesco.org/es/ev.php-URL_ID=31108&amp;URL_DO=DO_PRINTPAGE&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional cuisine is famous for an abundance of vegetables and greens used seasonally in the dishes. Fresh herbs, including mint, cilantro (coriander), dill, basil, parsley, tarragon, leeks, chives, thyme, marjoram, green onion, and watercress, are very popular and often accompany main dishes on the table. Climatic diversity and fertility of the land are reflected in the national dishes, which are based on fish from the [[Caspian Sea]], local meat (mainly mutton and beef), and an abundance of seasonal vegetables and greens. Saffron-rice [[plov]] is the flagship food in Azerbaijan and [[black tea]] is the national beverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Akhmedov| first = IA| script-title=ru:Азербайджанская кухня | publisher = Издательство &quot;Ишыг&quot;| url = http://www.azeri.ru/az/cuisine/azerbaydjanskaya_kuhnya|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijanis often use traditional [[armudu]] (pear-shaped) glass as they have very strong [[Azerbaijani tea culture|tea culture]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aze&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url =http://aze.info/azerbaijan_traditions/chaihana_baku/| title = Chaihana: culture in action|publisher =Aze.info| accessdate = 14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sZVN2MwWZVAC&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=tea+in+Azerbaijan.&amp;hl=ru&amp;ei=eVC0TqfZEJHcsgaL5uXSAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=chaykhanas&amp;f=false |title=The Azerbaijani Turks: power and identity under Russian rule.

Many ancient architectural treasures such as the [[Maiden Tower (Baku)|Maiden Tower]] and [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs]] in the [[Baku|Walled City of Baku]] survive in modern Azerbaijan. Entries submitted on the [[UNESCO World Heritage]] tentative list include the [[Ateshgah of Baku]], [[Momine Khatun Mausoleum]], [[Hirkan National Park]], [[Binegadi National Park]], [[Lökbatan Mud Volcano]], [[Baku Stage Mountain]], [[Caspian Shore Defensive Constructions]], [[Shusha National Reserve]], [[Ordubad National Reserve]] and the [[Palace of Shaki Khans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Azerbaijan Properties inscribed on the World Heritage List | publisher = [[UNESCO]] | url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/az}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =World Heritage Sites in Azerbaijan | publisher = World Heritage Site | url = http://www.worldheritagesite.org/countries/azerbaijan.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other architectural treasures are [[Quadrangular castle (Mardakan)|Quadrangular Castle]] in [[Mardakan]], [[Parigala]] in [[Yuxarı Çardaqlar|Yukhary Chardaglar]], a number of bridges spanning the Aras River, and several mausoleums. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, little monumental architecture was created, but distinctive residences were built in Baku and elsewhere. Among the most recent architectural monuments, the [[Baku Metro|Baku subways]] are noted for their lavish decor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Over 70 underground stations to be built in Baku|url=http://news.az/articles/economy/25958|publisher=News.Az|accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The task for modern Azerbaijani architecture is diverse application of modern aesthetics, the search for an architect's own artistic style and inclusion of the existing historico-cultural environment. Major projects such as [[Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center]], [[Flame Towers]], [[Baku Crystal Hall]], [[Baku White City]] and [[SOCAR Tower]] have transformed the country's skyline and promotes its contemporary identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=1 February 2012 Jon Walton |url=http://www.constructiondigital.com/under_construction/100-billion-khazar-islands-taking-shape |title=$100 Billion Khazar Islands Taking Shape |publisher=Construction Digital |date=1 February 2012 |accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Glass|first=Nick|title=Flame Towers light up Baku's historic skyline|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/09/26/world/asia/great-buildings-barry-hughes|publisher=CNN |accessdate=14 April 2013|authorlink=Nick Glass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual art===
{{Main article|Visual arts of Azerbaijan}}
[[File:Sheki dvoretc rospisi az.jpg|thumb|400px|A [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature painting]] of a battle scene on the walls of the [[Palace of Shaki Khans]], 18th century, [[Shaki, Azerbaijan|city of Shaki]].]]
Azerbaijani art includes one of the oldest art objects in the world, which were discovered as [[Gamigaya Petroglyphs]] in the territory of [[Ordubad Rayon]] are dated back to the 1st to 4th centuries BC. About 1500 dislodged and carved rock paintings with images of deer, goats, bulls, dogs, snakes, birds, fantastic beings and also people, carriages and various symbols had been found out on basalt rocks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irs-az.com/pdf/090621154956.pdf Наскальные рисунки Гямигая]. irs-az.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Norwegian [[ethnographer]] and adventurer [[Thor Heyerdahl]] was convinced that people from the area went to [[Scandinavia]] in about 100 AD and took their boat building skills with them, and transmuted them into the Viking boats in Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ornaments Coming from Gobustan |url=http://divainternational.ch/spip.php?article169|work=Diva International}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gobustan Rock Art|url=http://www.worldheritagesite.org/sites/gobustan.html|work=www.worldheritagesite.org|accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the centuries, Azerbaijani art has gone through many stylistic changes. Azerbaijani painting is traditionally characterized by a warmth of colour and light, as exemplified in the works of [[Azim Azimzade]] and [[Bahruz Kangarli]], and a preoccupation with religious figures and cultural motifs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Azerbaijani Artists |url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/soviet/Azerbaijani-Artists.html|website=www.arthistoryarchive.com|accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijani painting enjoyed preeminence in Caucasus for hundreds of years, from the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Culture of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] periods, and through the [[Socialist realism|Soviet]] and [[Baroque]] periods, the latter two of which saw fruition in Azerbaijan. Other notable artists who fall within these periods include [[Sattar Bahlulzade]], [[Togrul Narimanbekov]], [[Tahir Salahov]], [[Alakbar Rezaguliyev]], [[Mirza Gadim Iravani]], [[Mikayil Abdullayev]] and [[Boyukagha Mirzazade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Steps of Time &amp; Art is not only ugly|url=http://universes-in-universe.org/eng/nafas/articles/2008/azerbaijan_art|work=universes-in-universe.org|accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film industry in Azerbaijan dates back to 1898. In fact, Azerbaijan was among the first countries involved in [[cinematography]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mishon&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/53_folder/53_articles/53_100years.html|title=Cinema in Azerbaijan: Pre-Soviet Era|date=Autumn 1997|publisher=&quot;Azerbaijan International&quot;|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it's not surprising that this apparatus soon showed up in [[Baku]] – at the start of the 20th century, this bay town on the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] was producing more than 50 percent of the world's supply of oil. Just like today, the oil industry attracted foreigners eager to invest and to work.&lt;ref name=&quot;cinemainazerbaijan&quot;&gt;[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/53_folder/53_articles/53_100years.html Celebrating 100 Years in Film, not 80] by Aydin Kazimzade. Azerbaijan International, Autumn 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, during the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]], a documentary ''The Celebration of the Anniversary of Azerbaijani Independence'' was filmed on Azerbaijan's independence day, 28 May, and premiered in June 1919 at several theatres in Baku.&lt;ref name=&quot;ocaz&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title =Azerbaijani cinema in 1920–1935: Silent films | publisher = OCAZ.eu| url = http://www.ocaz.eu/cinema-theatre.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Soviet power was established in 1920, Nariman Narimanov, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Azerbaijan, signed a decree nationalizing Azerbaijan's cinema. This also influenced the creation of [[Azerbaijani animation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ocaz&quot;/&gt;

In 1991, after Azerbaijan gained its independence from the Soviet Union, the first Baku International Film Festival East-West was held in Baku. In December 2000, the former President of Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev, signed a decree proclaiming 2 August to be the professional holiday of filmmakers of Azerbaijan. Today Azerbaijani filmmakers are again dealing with issues similar to those faced by cinematographers prior to the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1920. Once again, both choice of content and sponsorship of films are largely left up to the initiative of the filmmaker.&lt;ref name=&quot;mishon&quot;/&gt;

===Media and media freedom===
{{Main article|Media of Azerbaijan|Media freedom in Azerbaijan}}
There are three state-owned television channels: [[AzTV]], [[Idman Azerbaijan TV|Idman TV]] and [[Medeniyyet TV]]. One public channel and 6 private channels: [[İctimai Television]], [[ANS TV]], [[Space TV]], [[Lider TV]], [[Azad Azerbaijan TV]], [[Xazar TV]] and [[Region TV]].

===Human rights in Azerbaijan===
{{Main article|Human rights in Azerbaijan}}

The [[Constitution of Azerbaijan]] claims to guarantee freedom of speech, but this is denied in practice. After several years of decline in press and media freedom, in 2014 the media environment in Azerbaijan deteriorated fast under a governmental campaign to silence any opposition and criticism, even while the country led the Committee of Ministers of the [[Council of Europe]] (May–November 2014). Spurious legal charges and impunity in violence against journalists have remained the norm.&lt;ref name=pace&gt;Parliamentary Assembly of the [[Council of Europe]], [http://www.cfom.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/PACE-HORSLEY-FINAL-2014-REPORT-AAC-25_14-Flego-protection-of-media-freedom-18-June.pdf The Protection of media freedom in Europe].Background report prepared by Mr William Horsley, special representative for media freedom of the [[Association of European Journalists]]&lt;/ref&gt; All foreign broadcasts are banned in the country.&lt;ref name=FH&gt;[[Freedom House]], [https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/azerbaijan Azerbaijan] 2015 Press Freedom report&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2013 [[Freedom House]] [[Freedom of the Press (report)|Freedom of the Press report]], Azerbaijan's press freedom status is &quot;not free,&quot; and Azerbaijan ranks 177th out of 196 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom of the Press 2013|url=https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FOTP%202013%20Full%20Report.pdf|publisher=Freedom House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] and [[Voice of America]] are banned in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Threat to retransmission of BBC, Voice of America and Radio Liberty/Radio Free Europe|url=https://rsf.org/en/news/threat-retransmission-bbc-voice-america-and-radio-libertyradio-free-europe|publisher=Reporters Without Borders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last few years, three journalists were killed and several prosecuted in trials described as unfair by international human rights organizations. Azerbaijan has the biggest number of journalists imprisoned in Europe and Central Asia in 2015, according to the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], and is the 5th most censored country in the world, ahead of Iran and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ognianova|first1=Nina|title=Baku 2015: Press freedom, Azerbaijan, and the European Games|url=https://cpj.org/blog/2015/06/baku-2015-press-freedom-azerbaijan-and-the-europea.php|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by an [[Amnesty International]] researcher in October 2015 points to '...the severe deterioration of human rights in Azerbaijan over the past few years. Sadly Azerbaijan has been allowed to get away with unprecedented levels of repression and in the process almost wipe out its civil society'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nozadze|first1=Natalia|title=Azerbaijan closes its doors|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/10/azerbaijan-closes-its-doors/|website=News|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty's 2015/16 annual report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amnesty|first1=International|title=Annual report on Azerbaijan|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/europe-and-central-asia/azerbaijan/|website=Amnesty International}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the country stated ' ... persecution of political dissent continued. Human rights organizations remained unable to resume their work. At least 18 prisoners of conscience remained in detention at the end of the year. Reprisals against independent journalists and activists persisted both in the country and abroad, while their family members also faced harassment and arrests. International human rights monitors were barred and expelled from the country. Reports of torture and other ill-treatment persisted.'

The Guardian reported 9-4-17: &quot;Azerbaijan’s ruling elite operated a secret $2.9bn (£2.2bn) scheme to pay prominent Europeans, buy luxury goods and launder money through a network of opaque British companies, an investigation by the Guardian reveals. Leaked data shows that the Azerbaijani leadership, accused of serial human rights abuses, systemic corruption and rigging elections, made more than 16,000 covert payments from 2012 to 2014. Some of this money went to politicians and journalists, as part of an international lobbying operation to deflect criticism of Azerbaijan’s president, Ilham Aliyev, and to promote a positive image of his oil-rich country. There is no suggestion that all the recipients were aware of the original source of the money. It arrived via a disguised route.&quot;
