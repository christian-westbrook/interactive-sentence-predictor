'''Anacondas''' are a group of large [[snake]]s of the genus '''''[[Eunectes]]'''''. They are found in tropical [[South America]]. Four species are currently recognized.

==Description==
Although the name applies to a group of snakes, it is often used to refer only to one species in particular, the common or green anaconda (''[[Eunectes murinus]]'') which is the largest snake in the world by weight, and the second longest.

==Etymology==
The South American names ''anacauchoa'' and ''anacaona'' were suggested in an account by [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]] but the idea of a South American origin was questioned by [[Henry Walter Bates]] who, in his travels in South America, failed to find any similar name in use. The word anaconda is derived from the name of a snake from Ceylon (Sri Lanka) that [[John Ray]] described in Latin in his ''Synopsis Methodica Animalium'' (1693) as ''serpens indicus bubalinus anacandaia zeylonibus, ides bubalorum aliorumque jumentorum membra conterens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/synopsismethodic00rayj#page/332/mode/1up|page=332|year=1693|author=Ray, John|title=Synopsis methodica animalium quadrupedum et serpentini generis |publisher= Impensis S. Smith &amp; B. Walford|place=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray used a catalogue of snakes from the Leyden museum supplied by Dr. [[Tancred Robinson]], but the description of its habit was based on [[Andreas Cleyer]] who in 1684 described a gigantic snake that crushed large animals by coiling and crushing their bones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles |last=Owen |year=1742| title=An essay towards a natural history of serpents |page=114|url=https://archive.org/stream/essaytowardsnat00owen#page/114/mode/2up/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Yule]] in his [[Hobson-Jobson]] notes that the word became more popular due to a piece of fiction published in 1768 in the Scots Magazine by a certain R. Edwin. Edwin described a ''tiger'' being crushed and killed by an anaconda when in fact tigers never occurred in Sri Lanka. Yule and [[Frank Wall]] noted that the snake was in fact a python and suggested a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] origin ''anai-kondra'' meaning elephant killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wall|first=Frank |year=1921|title=Ophidia Taprobanica or the Snakes of Ceylon. |publisher=Government Press|place=Ceylon |url=https://archive.org/stream/ophidiataprobani00wall#page/48/mode/1up/search/|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese]] origin was also suggested by Donald Ferguson who pointed out that the word ''Henakandaya'' (''hena'' lightning/large and ''kanda'' stem/trunk) was used in Sri Lanka for the small whip snake (''[[Ahaetulla pulverulenta]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Spolia Zeylanica |year=1904 |volume=1 |url=https://archive.org/stream/spoliazeylanica01nati#page/84/mode/1up/| title=Some rare snakes of Ceylon|pages=81–89|author=Willey, A}}&lt;/ref&gt; and somehow got misapplied to the python before myths were created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Notes and Queries|volume=12|year=1897|author=Ferguson, Donald |pages=123–124 |title=The derivation of &quot;Anaconda&quot;|url=https://archive.org/stream/s8notesqueries12londuoft#page/122/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A concise etymological dictionary of the English Language|last=Skeat|first=Walter W.| publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1882| page=16|url=https://archive.org/stream/conciseetymologi00skea#page/16/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://archive.org/stream/hobsonjobsonagl02croogoog#page/n75/mode/1up|pages=24–25|title=Hobson-Jobson. |last1=Yule|first1=Henry|first2=A.C.|last2=Burnell|publisher=John Murray|place=London| year=1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name commonly used for the anaconda in Brazil is ''sucuri'', ''sucuriju'' or ''sucuriuba''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dicionário online de português: sucuriju|url=http://www.dicio.com.br/sucuriju/|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
