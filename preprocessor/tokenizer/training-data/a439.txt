'''Accordions''' (from 19th century German ''Akkordeon'', from ''Akkord''—&quot;musical chord, concord of sounds&quot;&lt;ref&gt;'''[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=accordion&amp;searchmode=none accordion]''', entry in [[Online Etymology Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt;) are a family of box-shaped [[musical instrument]]s of the [[bellows]]-driven [[free reed aerophone|free-reed aerophone]] type, colloquially referred to as a [[squeezebox]]. A person who plays the accordion is called an ''accordionist''.  The [[concertina]] and [[Bandoneon|bandoneón]] are related; the [[harmonium]] and [[American reed organ]] are in the same family.

The instrument is played by compressing or expanding the bellows while pressing buttons or [[Musical keyboard|keys]], causing ''pallets'' to open, which allow air to flow across strips of brass or steel, called ''[[reed (instrument)|reeds]]''. These vibrate to produce sound inside the body. Valves on opposing reeds of each note are used to make the instrument's reeds sound louder without air leaking from each reed block.&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;For the accordion's place among the families of musical instruments, see Henry Doktorski's [http://www.ksanti.net/free-reed/description/taxonomy.html ''Taxonomy of Musical Instruments'' (''The Classical Free-Reed, Inc.'')] Also on this page is Diarmuid Pigott's ''The Free-Reed Family of Aerophones''&lt;/ref&gt;  The performer normally plays the melody on buttons or keys on the right-hand [[manual (music)|manual]], and the [[accompaniment]], consisting of bass and pre-set chord buttons, on the left-hand manual.

The accordion is widely spread across the world. In some countries (for example [[Brazil]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blognejo.com.br/blognejo-informa/top-five-os-maiores-sanfoneiros-da-musica-sertaneja-atual|title=TOP FIVE – OS MAIORES SANFONEIROS DA MÚSICA SERTANEJA ATUAL - Blognejo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://divirta-se.uai.com.br/app/noticia/musica/2013/05/22/noticia_musica,142451/o-dono-da-festa.shtml|title=Novo disco de Michel Teló junta sanfona, música sertaneja, eletrônica e ritmos dançantes|work=Divirta-se - Tudo sobre entretenimento, cinema, shows, celebridades e promoções}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colombia]] and [[Mexico]]) it is used in popular music (for example [[Forró]], [[Música sertaneja|Sertanejo]] and B-Pop in [[Brazil]]), whereas in other regions (such as [[Europe]], [[North America]] and other countries in [[South America]]) it tends to be more used for [[dance-pop]] and [[folk music]] and as well as in regional and  is often used in [[folk music]] in [[Europe]], [[North America]] and [[South America]]. Nevertheless, in Europe and North America, [[Accordion#Use in popular music|some popular music acts]] also make use of the instrument. Additionally, the accordion is also used in [[Cajun music|cajun]], [[zydeco]], [[jazz music]] and in both solo and orchestra performances of [[classical music]].
The [[piano accordion]] is the official city instrument of [[San Francisco]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=City Makes Accordion San Francisco's Official Instrument|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1990/City-Makes-Accordion-San-Francisco-s-Official-Instrument/id-376dd5a7b608f64b18abf834aaafc0fd|accessdate=24 December 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Associated Press|date=24 April 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Many conservatories in Europe have classical accordion departments.  The oldest name for this group of instruments is ''harmonika'', from the Greek ''harmonikos'', meaning ''harmonic, musical''. Today, native versions of the name ''accordion'' are more common. These names refer to the type of accordion [[Accordion#History|patented by Cyrill Demian]], which concerned &quot;automatically coupled chords on the bass side&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dyremose, Jeanette &amp; Lars, ''Det levende bælgspil'' (2003), p.133&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
[[File:Spirk.ogv|thumb|right|A [[diatonic button accordion]] being played.]]
Accordions have many configurations and types. What may be technically possible to do with one accordion could be impossible with another:
* Some accordions are ''bisonoric'', producing different [[pitch (music)|pitches]] depending on the direction of bellows movement
* Others are ''unisonoric'' and produce the same pitch in both directions. The pitch also depends on its size
* Some use a [[chromatic]] buttonboard for the right-hand manual
* Others use a [[diatonic]] buttonboard for the right-hand manual
* Yet others use a [[piano]]-style [[musical keyboard]] for the right-hand manual
* Some can play in different [[register (music)|registers]]
* Craftsmen and technicians may tune the same registers differently, &quot;personalizing&quot; the end result, such as an [[organ (instrument)|organ]] technician might [[voicing (music)|voice]] a particular instrument

=== Universal components ===

==== Bellows ====
{{Listen
|filename=AccordionBellowsSounds.ogg
|title=Accordion bellows controlled sounds
|description=A sample of effects that can be achieved with the bellows—949&amp;nbsp;KB
|format=[[Ogg]]}}
The [[bellows]] is the most recognizable part of the instrument, and the primary means of [[articulation (music)|articulation]]. Similar to a [[violin]]'s bow, the production of sound in an accordion is in direct proportion to the motion of the player. The bellows is located between the right- and left-hand manuals, and is made from [[pleat]]ed layers of cloth and cardboard, with added leather and metal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://1accordion.net/bellows.htm How To Repair Bellows] Ike's Accordion&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to create pressure and vacuum, driving air across the internal [[reed (instrument)|reeds]] and producing sound by their vibration, applied pressure increasing the volume.

The keyboard touch is not [[keyboard expression|expressive]] and does not affect [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]]: all expression is effected through the bellows: some bellows effects as illustrated below:
# Bellows used for volume control/fade
# Repeated change of direction (&quot;bellows shake&quot;), which has been popularized by [[Luiz Gonzaga]]&lt;ref&gt;[{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/luiz-gonzaga-mn0000316340 |title= Luiz Gonzaga:Biography by John Dougan |first=John |last=Dougan |website=All Music |publisher=RhythmOne group |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151130122258/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/luiz-gonzaga-mn0000316340/biography |archive-date=November 30, 2015 |dead-url=no |access-date=June 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is extensively used in [[Forró]] and called &quot;resfulengo&quot; in Brazil.
# Constant bellows motion while applying pressure at intervals
# Constant bellows motion to produce clear tones with no resonance
# Using the bellows with the silent air button gives the sound of air moving, which is sometimes used in contemporary compositions particularly for this instrument

==== Body ====
The accordion's body consists of two wood boxes joined together by the bellows. These boxes house reed chambers for the right- and left-hand manuals, respectively. Each side has [[grille]]s in order to facilitate the transmission of air in and out of the instrument, and to allow the [[sound]] to better project. The grille for the right-hand manual is usually larger and is often shaped for decorative purposes. The right-hand manual is normally used for playing the melody and the left-hand manual for playing the accompaniment, however skilled players can reverse these roles.&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;[[Guido Deiro]] claimed he was the first accordionist to play a solo with the left hand: ''Sharpshooter's March'' (1908) Guido Deiro, ''Guido Deiro's Own Story of Sharpshooters March'', ''The Pietro Musicordion'', Volume 6, Number 2 (May–June 1948)&lt;/ref&gt;

The size and weight of an accordion varies depending on its type, layout and playing range, which can be as small as  to have only one or two rows of basses and a single [[octave]] on the right-hand manual, to the standard 120-bass accordion and through to large and heavy 160-bass free-bass converter models.

==== Pallet mechanism ====
The accordion is an [[aerophone]]. The manual mechanism of the instrument either enables the air flow, or disables it:&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Illustration made with reference from a similar illustration that can be found in both ''Det levende bælgspil'' (p. 9) by Jeanette &amp; Lars Dyremose (2003), and ''Harmonikaens historie'' (p. 35a) by Bjarne Glenstrup (1972, The University of Copenhagen, Faculty of Music)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Accordion button mechanism.svg|750px|thumb|center|A side view of the pallet mechanism in a piano accordion. As the key is pressed down the pallet is lifted, allowing for air to enter the tone chamber in either direction and excite the reeds; air flow direction depends on the direction of bellows movement. A similar mechanical pallet movement is used in button accordions, as well as for bass mechanisms such as the Stradella ''bass machine'' that translates a single button press into multiple pallet openings for the notes of a chord.]]

=== Variable components ===
There is a wide range of instruments that are called ''accordion''. The different types have varying components. All instruments have reed ranks of some format. Not all have switches. The most typical accordion is the piano accordion, which is used for many musical genres. Another type of accordion is the button accordion, which is used in several musical traditions, including Cajun, Conjunto and [[Tejano music]], Swiss and Austro-German Alpine music, Argentinian tango music and many other folk genres.

==== Right-hand manual systems ====
[[File:PianoAccordeon.jpg|166px|right|thumb|A [[Weltmeister]] piano accordion]]
Different systems exist for the right-hand manual of an accordion, which is normally used for playing the melody. Some use a [[button (control)|button]] layout arranged in one way or another, while others use a [[piano]]-style keyboard. Each system has different claimed benefits&lt;ref name=&quot;pianovschromatic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.swipnet.se/nydana/accordiontest.pdf|author=Dan Lindgren |title=Piano Accordion vs. Chromatic Button Accordion|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318050921/http://home.swipnet.se/nydana/accordiontest.pdf |archive-date=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; by those who prefer it. They are also used to define one accordion or another as a different &quot;type&quot;:
* [[Chromatic button accordion]]s and the [[bayan (accordion)|bayan]], a [[Russia]]n variant, use a buttonboard where notes are arranged [[chromatic]]ally. Two major systems exist, referred to as the B-system and the C-system (there are also regional variants.)
* [[Diatonic button accordion]]s use a buttonboard designed around the notes of [[diatonic scales]] in a small number of keys. The keys are often arranged in one row for each key available.  Chromatic scales may be available by combining notes from different rows. The adjective &quot;diatonic&quot; is also commonly used to describe bisonic or bisonoric accordions—that is, instruments whose right-hand-manual (and in some instances even bass) keys each sound two different notes depending on the direction of the bellows (for instance, producing major triad sequences while closing the bellows and dominant seventh or 7-9 while opening). Such is the case, for instance, with the Argentinian [[bandoneon]], the Austro-German [[steirische Harmonika]], the Italian [[organetto]], the Swiss [[Schwyzerörgeli]] and the [[Anglo concertina]].
* [[Piano accordion]]s use a [[musical keyboard]] similar to a [[piano]], at right angles to the cabinet, the tops of the keys inward toward the bellows
* [[6-plus-6-instruments|6-plus-6]] accordions use a buttonboard with three rows of buttons in a 'uniform' or 'whole-tone' arrangement. The chromatic scale consists of two rows. The third row is a repetition of the first row. So there is the same fingering in all twelve scales. These accordions are produced only in special editions e. g. the 'logicordion' produced by [[VEB Klingenthaler Harmonikawerke|HARMONA]].

==== Left-hand manual systems ====
[[File:120-button Stradella chart.svg|thumb|right|250px|Typical 120-button Stradella bass system. This is the left-hand manual system found on most unisonoric accordions today]]
Different systems are also in use for the left-hand manual, which is normally used for playing the accompaniment. These almost always use distinct bass buttons and often have buttons with concavities or studs to help the player navigate the layout despite not being able to see the buttons while playing. There are three general categories:
* The [[Stradella bass system]], also called ''standard bass'', is arranged in a [[circle of fifths]] and uses single buttons for [[chord (music)|chords]]
* The [[Belgian bass system]] is a variation used in [[Belgium|Belgian]] chromatic accordions. It is also arranged in a circle of fifths but in reverse order. This system has 3 rows of basses, 3 rows of chord buttons allowing easier fingering for playing melodies, combined chords, better use of fingers 1 and 5, and more space between the buttons. This system was poorly traded outside of native Belgium
* Various [[free-bass system]]s for greater access to playing melodies on the left-hand manual and to forming one's own chords. These are often chosen for playing [[jazz]] and [[classical music]]. Some models can convert between free-bass and Stradella bass; this is called &quot;converter bass&quot;.  The free-bass left hand notes are arranged chromatically in three rows with one additional duplicate row of buttons.

==== Reed ranks and switches ====
{{main|Accordion reed ranks and switches}}
[[File:reedsinset.jpg|166px|thumb|right|Accordion [[Accordion reed ranks and switches|reed ranks]] with closeup of reeds]]

Inside the accordion are the reeds that generate the instrument tones. These are organized in different sounding ''banks'', which can be further combined into ''registers'' producing differing ''[[timbre]]s''. All but the smaller accordions are equipped with switches that control which combination of reed banks operate, organized from high to low [[register (music)|registers]]. Each register stop produces a separate sound timbre. See the [[accordion reed ranks and switches]] article for further explanation and audio samples.

All but the smallest accordions usually have treble switches. The larger and more expensive accordions often also have bass switches.

==== Classification of chromatic and piano type accordions ====
In describing/pricing an accordion, the first factor is size, expressed in number of keys on either side. For a piano type, this could for one example be 37/96, meaning 37 keys (3 octaves plus one note) on the treble side and 96 bass keys. After size, the price and weight of an accordion is largely dependent on the number of reed ranks on either side, either on a [[Accordion reed ranks and switches#Cassotto|cassotto]] or not, and to a lesser degree on the number of combinations available through register switches. Typically, these could be announced as '''Reeds: 5 + 3''', meaning five reeds on the treble side and three on the bass, and '''Registers: 13 + M, 7''', meaning 13 register buttons on the treble side plus a special &quot;master&quot; that activates all ranks, like the &quot;tutti&quot; on an organ, and seven register switches on the bass side.
[[File:Quito Accordion player.jpg|thumb|Accordion player in a street in the historic centre of [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]].]]

==== Straps ====
The larger piano and chromatic button accordions are usually heavier than other smaller [[squeezebox]]es, and are equipped with two shoulder [[straps]] to make it easier to balance the weight and increase bellows control while sitting, and avoid dropping the instrument while standing.

Other accordions, such as the [[diatonic button accordion]], have only a single shoulder strap and a right hand thumb strap. All accordions have a (mostly adjustable) leather strap on the left-hand manual to keep the player's hand in position while drawing the bellows. There are also straps above and below the bellows to keep it securely closed when the instrument is not playing.

=== Unusual accordions ===
[[File:Busking Accordionist.jpg|166px|right|thumb|Garmon player]]
Various hybrid accordions have been created between instruments of different buttonboards and actions.  Many remain curiosities — only a few have remained in use:
*The [[Schrammel accordion]], used in [[Vienna|Viennese]] [[chamber music]] and [[klezmer]], which has the treble buttonboard of a chromatic button accordion and a bisonoric bass buttonboard, similar to an expanded diatonic button accordion
*The [[Steirische Harmonika]] is a type of bisonoric diatonic button accordion particular to the alpine folk music of Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, the German state of Bavaria, and the Italian South Tyrol
*The [[schwyzerörgeli]] or [[Switzerland|Swiss]] organ, which usually has a 3-row diatonic treble and 18 unisonoric bass buttons in a bass/chord arrangement —  a subset of the Stradella system in reverse order like the Belgian bass – that travel parallel to the bellows motion
*The [[trikitixa]] of the [[Basque people]] has a two-row diatonic, bisonoric treble and a 12-button diatonic unisonoric bass
*In Scotland, the favoured diatonic accordion is the instrument known as the [[British Chromatic Accordion]]. While the right hand is bisonoric, the left hand follows the Stradella system. The elite form of this instrument is generally considered the German manufactured Shand Morino, produced by [[Hohner]] with the input of [[Jimmy Shand|Sir Jimmy Shand]]&lt;ref&gt;p.98, Howard, Rob (2003) ''An A to Z of the Accordion and related instruments'' Stockport: Robaccord Publications {{ISBN|978-0-9546711-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Pedal harmony|pl|3=Harmonia pedałowa}}, a type of accordion used sometimes in Polish folk music, has a pair of [[pump organ]]-like bellows attached.

== History ==
{{See also|Free reed aerophone#History|l1=History of free reed aerophones}}
The accordion is a free reed instrument and is in the same family as other instruments such as the [[Sheng (instrument)|sheng]] and [[khaen]]. The sheng and khaen are both much older than the accordion and this type of reed did inspire the kind of free reeds in use in the accordion as we know it today.

[[File:8 key accordion.JPG|250px|right|thumb|8-key bisonoric diatonic accordion (c. 1830)]]

The accordion's basic form is believed to have been invented in [[Berlin]] in 1822 by [[Christian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann]],&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;There is not a single document to back up this belief, Christian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann was 16 years old at that time and we do have some handwriting of C.F. Buschschmann and his Father, but without any related notice within. First time of mentioned a aeoline was in a writing dated 1829.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campacci|first1=Claudio|title=Século Xix|publisher=Clube de Autores|page=14|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=_VtPBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=Christian+Friedrich+Ludwig+Buschmann+1822&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrg6PFysTRAhVEqo8KHZr4BFs4ChDoAQgYMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20Friedrich%20Ludwig%20Buschmann%201822&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 January 2017|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; although one instrument has been recently discovered that appears to have been built earlier.&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;This is the accordion owned by Fredrik Dillner of Sweden, which has the name F. Löhner [[Nürnberg]] engraved (stamped) on it. The instrument was given to Johannes Dillner in 1830 or earlier&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ksanti.net/free-reed/essays/dillner_interview.html &quot;Interview with Fredrik Dillner—The Owner of What May Be ohe World's Oldest Accordion&quot;].

[[File:Dillner-accordion.jpg|thumb|Zitat Dillner Akkordeon]]

The earliest history of the accordion in Russia is poorly documented. Nevertheless, according to Russian researchers, the earliest known simple accordions were made in [[Tula, Russia]] by [[:ru:Воронцов, Тимофей Пименович|Timofey Vorontsov]] from 1820, and [[:ru:Сизов, Иван Евстратьевич|Ivan Sizov]] from 1830.&lt;ref&gt;Mirek, Alfred. ''Garmonika. Proshloe i nastoiashchee. Nauchno-istoricheskaia entsyklopedicheskaia kniga.'' Moscow, 1994. p.50&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1840s, the instrument was already very widespread;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://publ.lib.ru/ARCHIVES/__Raritetnye_knigi/IRGO_Etnograficheskij_sbornik_02_1854.pdf Etnograficheskii sbornik Russkogo geograficheskogo obshchestva.'' Vol.2], Saint Petersburg, 1854. p.26, 162.''&lt;/ref&gt; together the factories of the two masters were producing 10,000 instruments a year. By 1866, over 50,000 instruments were being produced yearly by Tula and neighbouring villages, and by 1874 the yearly production rate was over 700,000.&lt;ref&gt;Mirek, Alfred. ''Iz istorii akkordeona i baiana.'' Moscow, 1967. p.43-45&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1860s, [[Novgorod Governorate|Novgorod]], [[Vyatka Governorate|Vyatka]] and [[Saratov Governorate|Saratov]] Governorates also had significant accordion production. By the 1880s, the list included [[Oryol Governorate|Oryol]], [[Ryazan Governorate|Ryazan]], [[Moscow Governorate|Moscow]], [[Tver Governorate|Tver]], [[Vologda Governorate|Vologda]], [[Kostroma Governorate|Kostroma]], [[Nizhny Novgorod Governorate|Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Simbirsk Governorate|Simbirsk]] and others, and many of these places created their own varieties of the instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Banin A.A. ''Russkaia instrumentalnaia muzyka folklornoi traditsii''. Moscow, 1997. (p.144)&lt;/ref&gt;

The accordion is one of several European inventions of the early 19th century that used free reeds driven by a bellows. An instrument called ''accordion'' was first patented in 1829 by [[Cyrill Demian]], of Armenian origin, in [[Vienna]]&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;A summary and pictures of this patent can be found at [https://web.archive.org/web/20090619162610/http://www.ksanti.net/free-reed/history/demian.html www.ksanti.net/free-reed/history/demian.html] (Version of 20 Okt 4 – 19 Jun 09 Using Way Back Machine to Display:
The Classical Free-Reed, Inc.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Demian's instrument bore little resemblance to modern instruments. It only had a left hand buttonboard, with the right hand simply operating the bellows. One key feature for which Demian sought the patent was the sounding of an entire chord by depressing one key. His instrument also could sound two different chords with the same key; one for each bellows direction (a ''bisonoric'' action).

The piano accordion was first played in German-speaking regions, and then spread over Europe. Some early portable instrument with piano keys had been invented in 1821, but it started to actually be played much later, and built its reputation from there.

At that time in Vienna, mouth harmonicas with ''Kanzellen'' (chambers) had already been available for many years, along with bigger instruments driven by hand bellows. The [[diatonic]] key arrangement was also already in use on mouth-blown instruments. Demian's patent thus covered an accompanying instrument: an accordion played with the left hand, opposite to the way that contemporary chromatic hand harmonicas were played, small and light enough for travelers to take with them and used to accompany singing. The patent also described instruments with both [[Bass (sound)|bass]] and [[wikt:treble|treble]] sections, although Demian preferred the bass-only instrument owing to its cost and weight advantages.&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;German Text: &quot;Mit den Dekel des Balges, läßt sich das ganze Instrument verdoppeln, so daß man dadurch die Accorde vermehrt, oder auch mit einzelne Töne spielen kann, in diesem Fall, muß ein zweyter Einsatz mit Federn, und auch eine 2te Claviatur dazu kommen, der Blasebalg bleibt in der Mitte, jede Hand dirigirt abwechselnd, entweder die Claves, oder den Balg. Durch eine obengenannte Verdoplung des Instruments oder durch Vermehrung der Accorde, würde niemand etwas verbessern, oder was neues liefern, weil nur die Bestandtheile dadurch vermehrt, das Instrument theurer und schwerer wird.&quot;
Translation of this snip: With the Cover of the bellows the instrument can be duplicated, so the amount of Chords or single notes can be enlarged, or one can sound single notes, in this case, a second part with springs (free reeds) and also a second keyboard must be added, the bellows are in between these two parts, both hands push buttons and push and pull the bellows at the same time or alternatively. Through this doubling or increasing of chords within the instrument nothing new is invented or improved by someone else, because only the amount of similar parts is increased and the Instrument is heavier and more expensive.[http://www.akkordeon-online.de/instrum/demian.htm German full text]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1831 at least the accordion had appeared in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', Thursday, 3 March 1831; pg. 7; Issue 14477; col C :“POPULAR JOURNAL of MUSIC – On the 1st. Of March, price 2s., the third number, for 1831, of the HARMONICON. Contents. Musical Literature: - 1. Memoirs of Dr. Callcott – 2. Rodolphe Kreutzer- 3. On the Accordion and Symphonion...”&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument was noted in ''The Times'' of that year as one new to British audiences&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Thursday 9 June 1831; pg. 5; Issue 14560; col A: (Review of a performance by a flautist, [[Johann Sedlatzek|Mr. Sedlatzek]]) &quot;At the close of the concert Mr. Sedlatzek performed on a new instrument called the Accordion or Aeolian, which, however, has little beside its novelty to recommend it.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and not favourably reviewed, but nevertheless it soon became popular.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', Wednesday, 26 April 1837; pg. 5; Issue 16400; col C : “GREAT CONCERT-ROOM – KING’S THEATRE...There was also a novelty in the shape of an instrument called “a concertina,” an improvement on the accordion, which has been such a favourite musical toy for the last two or three years.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It had also become popular with New Yorkers by the mid-1840s at the latest.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', 19 May 1907:- 'The Lay of the Last of the Old Minstrels: Interesting Reminiscences of Isaac Odell, Who Was A Burnt Cork Artist Sixty Years Ago': “While we were drawing big crowds to the Palmer House on Chambers Street Charley White was making a great hit playing an accordion in Thalia Hall on Grand Street. In those days&quot;(i.e. mid-1840s) &quot;accordions were the real attraction to the public.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

After Demian's invention, other accordions appeared, some featuring only the righthanded keyboard for playing melodies. It took English inventor Charles Wheatstone to squeeze both chords and keyboard together in one squeezebox. His 1844 patent for what he called a “concertina” also featured the ability to easily tune the reeds from the outside with a simple tool.

[[File:Accordionschule1.JPG|thumb|right|166px|The first pages in Adolph Müller's accordion book]]
The musician Adolph Müller described a great variety of instruments in his 1833 book, ''Schule für Accordion''. At the time, [[Vienna]] and [[London]] had a close musical relationship, with musicians often performing in both cities in the same year, so it is possible that Wheatstone was aware of this type of instrument and may have used them to put his key-arrangement ideas into practice.

Jeune's [[flutina]] resembles Wheatstone's [[concertina]] in internal construction and [[tone color]], but it appears to complement Demian's accordion functionally. The flutina is a one-sided bisonoric melody-only instrument whose keys are operated with the right hand while the bellows is operated with the left. When the two instruments are combined, the result is quite similar to [[diatonic]] button accordions still manufactured today.

Further innovations followed and continue to the present. Various buttonboard and keyboard systems have been developed, as well as voicings (the combination of multiple tones at different octaves), with mechanisms to switch between different voices during performance, and different methods of internal construction to improve tone, stability and durability.

== Use in various music genres ==
{{main|Accordion music genres}}
The accordion has traditionally been used to perform folk or [[ethnic music]], popular music, and transcriptions from the operatic and light-classical music repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Doktorski, CD booklet notes for &quot;[[Guido Deiro]]: Complete Recorded Works, Vol. 1,&quot; [[Archeophone Records]] (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Today the instrument is sometimes heard in contemporary pop styles, such as rock, pop-rock, etc.,&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes in modern pop music the accordion is not actually played, but its sound is heard by use of a MIDI instrument and sampled sound module.&lt;/ref&gt; and occasionally even in serious classical music concerts, as well as advertisements.

=== Use in traditional music ===

Invented in 1829, its popularity spread rapidly: it has mostly been associated with the common people, and was spread by Europeans who emigrated around the world. The accordion in both button and piano forms became a favorite of folk musicians&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Wagner, &quot;A Brief History of How the Accordion Changed the World,&quot; CD booklet notes for Planet Squeezebox, performed by various artists, (Roslyn, New York: Ellipsis Arts, 1995), 6&lt;/ref&gt; and has been integrated into [[traditional music]] styles all over the world: see the [[list of music styles that incorporate the accordion]].

Richard Galliano is an internationally known jazz accordionist. Some popular acts do use the instrument in their distinctive sounds. A notable example is [[Grammy Award|Grammy Award-winning]] [[Parody music|parodist]] [[&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic]], who plays the accordion on many of his musical tracks, particularly his [[polka]]s. Yankovic was trained in the accordion as a child.&lt;ref name=&quot;GraffDurchholz2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graff|first1=Gary|last2=Durchholz|first2=Daniel|title=Rock 'n' Roll Myths: The True Stories Behind the Most Infamous Legends|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JWlSUYbiUXUC&amp;pg=PT152|year=2012|publisher=MBI Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-61058-571-2|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use in classical music ===
{{Main|Accordion music genres#Use in classical music|l1=Accordion in classical music}}

Although best known as a folk instrument, it has grown in popularity among classical composers. The earliest surviving concert piece is ''{{lang|fr|Thême varié très brillant pour accordéon methode Reisner}}'', written in 1836 by Miss Louise Reisner of [[Paris]]. Other composers, including the Russian [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], the Italian [[Umberto Giordano]], and the American [[Charles Ives]] (1915), wrote works for the diatonic button accordion.

The first composer to write specifically for the [[chromatic music|chromatic]] accordion was [[Paul Hindemith]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akkordeon-online.de/english.htm ''Accordion Composers in German''] Accordion Online&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, the Austrian [[Alban Berg]] included an accordion in ''[[Wozzeck]]'', Op. 7. In 1937 the first [[Accordion concerto]] was composed in Russia. Other notable composers have written for the accordion during the first half of the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;Henry Doktorski, &quot;The Classical Squeezebox: A Short History of the Accordion and Other Free-Reed Instruments in Classical Music,&quot; The Classical Free-Reed, Inc. (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; American composer [[William P. Perry]] featured the accordion in his orchestral suite ''Six Title Themes in Search of a Movie'' (2008). The experimental composer [[Howard Skempton]] began his musical career as an accordionist, and has written numerous solo works for it. In his work ''Drang'' (1999), British composer [http://www.johnpalmer.org John Palmer] has pushed the expressive possibilities of the accordion/bayan to the limits of virtuosity.
Accordionists like Geir Draugsvoll, [[Mogens Ellegaard]], [[Joseph Macerollo]], [[Friedrich Lips]], [[Stefan Hussong]], [[Teodoro Anzellotti]], Mie Miki, encouraged composers to write new music for the accordion (solo and chamber music) and also started playing baroque music (Bach, Scarlatti) on the free bass accordion.

French composer [[Henri Dutilleux]] used an accordion in both his late song cycles ''Correspondances'' (2003) and ''[[Le Temps l'horloge|Le Temps l'Horloge]]'' (2009).  Russian-born composer Sofia Gubaidulina has composed solos, concertos, and chamber works for accordion.   Astor Piazzolla's concert tangos are performed widely.   Piazzolla performed on the bandoneon, but his works can be performed on either bandoneon or accordion.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
The accordion is a traditional instrument in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It is the dominant instrument used in [[sevdalinka]], a traditional genre of [[folk music]] from Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is also considered a national instrument of the country.

=== Brazil ===
The accordion is widely used in [[Brazil]], in traditional as well as pop music.   Compared to many other countries, the instrument enjoys in Brazil high popularity in mainstream pop music.   In some parts of the country, such as the North-East it is the most popular melodic instrument.   As opposed to most European folk, a very dry tuning is usually used in Brazil.

The accordion (predominantly the piano accordion) is used in almost all styles of [[Forró]] (in particular in the subgenres of Xote and [[baião (music)|Baião]]) as principal instrument, [[Luiz Gonzaga]] (the King of the [[baião (music)|Baião]]) and [[Dominguinhos]] being among the notable musicians in this style.  In this musical style the typical combination is a trio of accordion, [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]] and [[zabumba]] (a type of drum).   This style has gained popularity recently, in particular among the student population of the South-East of the country (in the [[Forró]] Universitário genre, with important exponents today being Falamansa, and trios such as Trio Dona Zefa, Trio Virgulino and Trio Alvorada).   Moreover, the accordion is the principal instrument in Junina music (music of the São João Festival), with Mario Zan having been a very important exponent of this music.

It is an important instrument in [[Música sertaneja|Sertanejo]] (and Caipira) music, which originated in the Centre-west and South-east of Brazil and subsequently has gained popularity throughout the country. In the South of the country (where there is a preponderance of the button accordion), in particular in [[Rio Grande do Sul]], it used in the Brazilian Gaúcho musical style, an important exponent of this music being [[Renato Borghetti]].

=== Colombia ===
The accordion is also a traditional instrument in [[Colombia]], commonly associated with the [[vallenato]] and [[cumbia]] genres. The accordion has been used by [[tropipop]] musicians such as [[Carlos Vives]], [[Andrés Cabas]], [[Fonseca (singer)]] and [[Bacilos]], as well as [[rock music|rock]] musicians such as [[Juanes]] and pop musicians as [[Shakira]]. Vallenato, which emerged in the early twentieth century in a city known as Valledupar, has come to symbolize the folk music of Colombia. The legend of the accordion's arrival in Colombia comes from a story of a ship wreck that was coming from Germany to Argentina. The wreck happened over the Magdalena river in the Atlantic coast.

Every year in April, Colombia holds one of the most important musical festivals in the country: the [[Vallenato Legend Festival]]. The festival holds contests for best accordion player. Once every decade, the King of Kings accordion competition takes place, when winners of the previous festivals compete for the highest possible award for a vallenato accordion player: the ''Pilonera Mayor'' prize.&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian Channel, [http://www.smithsonianchannel.com/site/sn/show.do?show=134604 &quot;The Accordion Kings&quot;], 15 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the world's largest competitive accordion festival.

=== Mexico ===

[[Norteño (music)|Norteño]] heavily relies on the accordion, it is a genre related to [[polka]]. [[Ramón Ayala]] known in Mexico as the &quot;King of the Accordion&quot; is a norteño musician. [[Cumbia]] which features the accordion is also popular with musicians such as [[Celso Piña]] creating a more contemporary style.

U.S. born Mexican musician [[Julieta Venegas]] incorporates the sound of the instrument into rock, pop and folk. She was influenced by her fellow Chicanos [[Los Lobos]] who also use the music of the accordion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/local/gray-matters/article/Julieta-Venegas-6839928.php|title=Julieta Venegas: Life and songs in two cultures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North Korea ===
The accordion is widely taught in North Korea. It is known as the &quot;National Instrument.&quot; All North Korean student are expected to learn the accordion throughout their elementary and secondary education. On Kim Jong-il's birthday, the most important public holiday in North Korea, revolutionary songs like &quot;[[Sea of Blood]]&quot;  and [[:File:Song of Comradeship excerpt.ogg|&quot;Song of Comradeship&quot;]] are often played on the accordion.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

=== Use in heavy metal music ===
Accordionists in [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] make their most extensive appearances in the [[folk metal]] subgenre, and are otherwise generally rare. Full-time accordionists in folk metal seem even rarer, but they are still utilized for studio work, as flexible keyboardists are usually more accessible for live performances.

Notably, the Finnish symphonic folk-metal band [[Turisas]] has always had a full-time accordionist, employing [[classical music|classical]] and [[polka]]-style sensibilities alongside a violinist. Another Finnish metal band, [[Korpiklaani]], invokes a type of Finnish polka called [[humppa]], and also has a full-time accordionist. Sarah Kiener, the former [[hurdy-gurdy]] player for the Swiss melodic-death/folk metal band [[Eluveitie]], played a [[Helvetic Republic|Helvetic]] accordion known as a ''zugerörgeli'', which could be a distant relative (in one way or another) to the Swiss [[schwyzerörgeli]], as both are indigenous to and very rare outside of Switzerland.

== Manufacturing process ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017|small=yes}}

The best{{according to whom|date=June 2017}} accordions are always fully hand-made, particularly the reeds; completely hand-made reeds have a far{{peacock term|date=June 2017}} better tonal quality than even the best automatically-manufactured ones. Some accordions have been modified by individuals striving to bring a more pure{{clarify|date=June 2017}} sound out of low-end instruments, such as the ones improved by Yutaka Usui,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishdancemaster.com/ Yutaka Usuai], Japanese-born accordion craftsman.&lt;/ref&gt;{{irrelevant citation|reason=adds nothing to the article, except a gratuitous link to an external website, possibly for promotional purposes|date=June 2017}} a Japanese-born craftsman.

The manufacture of an accordion is only a partly automated process. In a sense{{clarify|date=June 2017}}, all accordions are handmade, since there is always some hand assembly of the small parts required. The general process involves making the individual parts, assembling the subsections, assembling the entire instrument, and final decorating and packaging.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081226093126/http://enotes.com/how-products-encyclopedia/accordion how-products-encyclopedia_accordion] Old way Back link to: how-products-encyclopedia accordion&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous{{according to whom|date=June 2017}} {{peacock term|date=June 2017}} centres of production are the Italian cities of [[Stradella, Lombardy|Stradella]] and [[Castelfidardo]], with many small and medium size manufacturers especially at the latter. Castelfidardo honours{{clarify|date=June 2017}} the memory of Paolo Soprani who was one of the first large-scale producers. The French town of [[Tulle]] has hosted{{clarify|date=June 2017}} Maugein Freres since 1919, and the company is now the last complete-process{{clarify|date=June 2017}} manufacturer of accordions in France. German companies such as [[Hohner]] and [[Weltmeister]] made large numbers of accordions, but production had diminished by the end of the 20th century.  Hohner still manufactures its top-end models{{clarify|date=June 2017}} in Germany, and Weltmeister instruments are still handmade by [[VEB Klingenthaler Harmonikawerke|HARMONA Akkordeon GmbH]] in [[Klingenthal]]. Cheaper /student models{{clarify|date=June 2017}} are often made in China.
