The '''Azerbaijani Armed Forces''' ({{lang-az|Azərbaycan Silahlı Qüvvələri}}) were re-established according to the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan on the Armed Forces from 9 October 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.president.az/ official web page of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] (ADR) had originally formed its own armed forces from 26 June 1918. However these were dissolved after Azerbaijan was absorbed into the Soviet Union as the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]] from 28 April 1920. After the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991–92 the armed forces were reformed based on Soviet bases and equipment left on Azeri soil.

The armed forces have three branches: the [[Azerbaijani Land Forces]], the [[Azerbaijani Air and Air Defence Force]], and the [[Azerbaijani Navy]].&lt;ref name=JSSA-MT /&gt; Associated forces include the [[Azerbaijani National Guard]], the [[Internal Troops of Azerbaijan]], and the [[State Border Service (Azerbaijan)|State Border Service]], which can be involved in state defense under certain circumstances.

According to the Azerbaijani media sources the military expenditures of Azerbaijan for 2009 were set at $2.46 billion [[United States dollar|USD]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Gov't allots over $2bn for 2009 defense spending |url= http://www.azernews.az/site/shownews.php?news_id=8601 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110706130859/http://www.azernews.az/site/shownews.php?news_id=8601 |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 6 July 2011 |publisher= AzerNEWS |first= |last= |date=12 November 2008 |accessdate= 12 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; however according to [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]], only $1.473 billion was spent in that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;SIPRI&quot;&gt;[[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]] [http://milexdata.sipri.org/ The SIPRI Military Expenditure Database] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725000000/http://milexdata.sipri.org/ |date=25 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IISS]] also suggests that the defence budget in 2009 was $1.5 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;IISS 2015&quot; /&gt; The [[Ministry of Defence Industry of Azerbaijan]] supervises the design, manufacturing, regulation and maintenance of military equipment.

The incumbent Minister of Defence of Azerbaijan is Colonel General [[Zakir Hasanov]], who succeeded [[Safar Abiyev]].

==Overview==
Since the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], Azerbaijan has been trying to further develop its armed forces into a professional, well trained, and mobile military. Azerbaijan has been undergoing extensive modernization and capacity expanding programs, with the military budget increasing from around $300 million in 2005 to $2.46 billion in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL1597375 | work=Reuters | title=Azerbaijan announces 53 pct rise in army spending | date=15 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total armed forces number 56,840 men in the land forces, 7,900 men in the air force and air defence force, and 2,200 men in the navy.&lt;ref name=&quot;IISS 2015&quot; /&gt; There are also 19,500 personnel in the National Guard, State Border Service, and Internal Troops.&lt;ref name=Blandy12&gt;C.

Azerbaijan has acceded to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] as a non-[[List of countries with nuclear weapons|nuclear weapons state]]. Azerbaijan participates in [[NATO]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]]. Azerbaijan joined the [[Multi-National Force – Iraq|multi-national force]] in 2003. It sent 150 troops to Iraq, and later troops to Kosovo. Azeri troops are still serving in Afghanistan.

Despite the rise in Azerbaijan's defence budget,&lt;ref&gt;Blandy, 'Azerbaijan: Is War Over Nagornyy Karabakh a Realistic Option?, 2008, p.6, quoting http://nvo.ng.ru/wars/2007-02-09/2_poroh.html Nezavisimoye Voyennoye Obozreniye 9 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; the armed forces were assessed in 2008 as not having a high state of battle readiness and being ill-prepared for wide scale combat operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blandy, 2008, p.7&quot;&gt;Blandy, 2008, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2017 Global Firepower ranked Azerbaijan 59th among 127 countries for its military strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing.asp|title=2017 World Military Powers|access-date=2017-04-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the best performance among the countries of South Caucasus.

Today '[[National Hero of Azerbaijan]]' is the highest national title in the country, awarded for outstanding services of national importance to Azerbaijan in defense, as well as other deeds in other spheres.

==History of the Azerbaijani military==
{{Main|Military history of Azerbaijan}}

===Azerbaijan Democratic Republic===
[[File:Mehmandarov.jpg|thumb|125px|left|[[Samad bey Mehmandarov]], the Minister of Defense of [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]]]]
The history of the modern Azerbaijan army dates back to [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] in 1918, when the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan Republic were created on 26 June 1918. First ''de facto'' Minister of Defense of ADR was Dr. [[Khosrov bey Sultanov]]. When the Ministry was formally established Gen. [[Samedbey Mehmandarov]] became the minister, and then Lt-Gen. [[Ali-Agha Shikhlinski]] his deputy. Chiefs of Staff of ADR Army were Lt-Gen. [[Maciej Sulkiewicz]] (March 1919 – 10 December 1919) and Maj-Gen. Abdulhamid bey Gaitabashi (10 December 1919 – April 1920).&lt;ref name=&quot;Azerbaijani Army marks 91 years&quot;&gt;[http://en.apa.az/print.php?id=104326 Azerbaijani Army marks 91 years] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225202625/http://en.apa.az/print.php?id=104326 |date=25 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.today.az/news/politics/53397.html Today.Az – Azerbaijan marks Day of Armed Forces]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Red Army]] invaded Azerbaijan on 28 April 1920. Although the bulk of the newly formed Azerbaijani army was engaged in putting down an Armenian revolt that had just broken out in [[Karabakh]], the Azeris did not surrender their brief independence of 1918–20 quickly or easily. As many as 20,000 of the total 30,000 soldiers died resisting what was effectively a Russian reconquest.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Army of Azerbaijan in 1918.jpg|thumb|Officers of the army of the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] in 1918.]]

===World War II===
[[File:Парад 1960 г. 6 рота.jpg|thumb|Cadets of the [[Baku Higher All-Arms Command School]] during a parade in Baku in 1960.]]
During [[World War II]], Azerbaijan played a crucial role in the strategic energy policy of Soviet Union. Much of the Soviet Union's oil on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] was supplied by Baku. By a decree of the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]] in February 1942, the commitment of more than 500 workers and employees of the oil industry of Azerbaijan was recognised with orders and medals.
[[Operation Edelweiss]] carried out by the German [[Wehrmacht]] targeted [[Baku]] because of the importance of its oil fields to the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;[[Swietochowski, Tadeusz]](1995) ''Russia and Azerbaijan: A Borderland in Transition, Columbia University'', p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some 800,000 Azerbaijanis fought within the ranks of the Soviet Army of which 400,000 died. Azeri national formations of the [[Red Army]] included the [[223rd Rifle Division|223rd]], [[227th Rifle Division|227th]], [[396th Rifle Division|396th]], [[402nd Rifle Division|402nd]], and [[416th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|416th Rifle Division]]s. Azeri Major-General [[Hazi Aslanov]] was awarded a second [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] after a long post-war fight for recognition of his accomplishments.

===Dissolution of the Soviet armed forces===
During the Cold War, Azerbaijan had been the deployment area of units of the Soviet [[4th Army (Soviet Union)|4th Army]] whose principle formations in 1988 included four motor rifle divisions ([[23rd Guards Motor Rifle Division|23rd Guards]], [[60th Motor Rifle Division|60th]], 75th, and [[295th Motor Rifle Division|295th]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ww2.dk/new/army/armies/4oa.htm|title=4th Combined Arms Army|website=www.ww2.dk|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[75th Motor Rifle Division]] was isolated in [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhichevan]]. The 4th Army also included missile and air defense brigades and artillery and rocket regiments. The 75th Division's stores and equipment were apparently transferred to the Nakhichevan authorities.&lt;ref&gt;See reference at [[7th Guards Army]] article.&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijan also hosted the 49th Arsenal of the Soviet [[Main Agency of Missiles and Artillery of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation|Main Agency of Missiles and Artillery]], which contained over 7,000 train-car loads of ammunition to the excess of one billion units.

The first president of Azerbaijan, [[Ayaz Mutallibov]], did not wish to build an independent army, wanting to rely instead largely on Soviet troops. Even when the Parliament decided that an army should be formed in September 1991, disagreements between the government and the opposition [[Azerbaijani Popular Front Party]] impeded creation of a unified force.&lt;ref&gt;International Crisis Group, Azerbaijan: Defence Sector Management and Reform Crisis Group Europe Briefing N°50, 29 October 2008, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, the first unit of the new army was formed on the basis of the 18–110 military unit of [[mechanized infantry]] of the [[Soviet Ground Forces]] (probably part of the [[4th Army (Soviet Union)|4th Army]]) located in [[Shikhov]], south of Baku.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dejure.az/index.php/cra-hakimiyyti/70-nazirliklr/99-azrbaycan-respublikas-muedafi-nazirliyi |title=Azərbaycan Respublikası Müdafiə Nazirliyi. 1991-dən sonra |trans_title=Ministry of Defense of Azerbaijan Republic.

[[File:Рота почетного караула на параде, 1966 г.jpg|thumb|A Guard of Honor during a parade in Baku in 1966.]]
In summer 1992, the nascent Defense Ministry received a resolution by the Azerbaijani president on the takeover of units and formations in Azerbaijani territory. It then forwarded an ultimatum to Moscow demanding control over vehicles and armaments of the 135th and 139th Motor Rifle Regiments of the [[295th Motor Rifle Division]].&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Petrov, [http://mdb.cast.ru/mdb/4-2002/dp/hscwa/?form=print How South Caucasus was armed], Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies (Moscow, Russia)&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1992, Azerbaijan ratified the [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]] (CFE), which establishes comprehensive limits on key categories of conventional military equipment. Azerbaijan approved the CFE flank agreement in May 1997.

The transfer of the property of the 4th Army (except for part of the property of the 366th Motor Rifle Regiment of the [[23rd Guards Motor Rifle Division]] captured by Armenian armed formations in 1992 during the regiment's withdrawal from Stepanakert) and the 49th arsenal was completed in 1992. Thus, by the end of 1992, Azerbaijan received arms and military hardware sufficient for approximately four motor rifle divisions with prescribed army units. It also inherited naval ships. There are also reports that 50 combat aircraft from the disbanded [[Baku Air Defence Army|19th Army]] of the [[Soviet Air Defence Forces]] came under Azeri control.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}
After Lt Gen Barshadli became Chief of General Staff, [[Minister of Defense (Azerbaijan)#Ministers of Defense of Azerbaijan Republic|subsequent defense ministers from 1992]] have included:

* Maj.-Gen. [[Tajeddin Mehdiyev]] (December 1991 – February 1992)
* Colonel [[Shahin Musayev]] (February 1992) ''(acting)''
* Interior Troops Colonel [[Tahir Aliyev]] (February - March 1992)

The Azeri armed forces took a series of devastating defeats by Armenian forces&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm 1993 UN Security Council Resolutions on Nagorno-Karabakh] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117200012/http://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm |date=17 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; during the 1992–1994 [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]], which resulted in the loss of control of Nagorno-Karabakh proper and seven surrounding [[rayon]]s, comprising roughly 20%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/Azerbaijan/IDPs-in-Azerbaijan-48091|title=IDPs in Azerbaijan|last=Caucaso|first=Osservatorio Balcani e|work=Osservatorio Balcani e Caucaso|access-date=2017-09-26|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2008/ga10693.doc.htm|title=GENERAL ASSEMBLY ADOPTS RESOLUTION REAFFIRMING TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF AZERBAIJAN, DEMANDING WITHDRAWAL OF ALL ARMENIAN FORCES {{!}} Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.angloasianmining.com/azerbaijan/history/|title=Anglo Asian Mining PLC|website=www.angloasianmining.com|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2014/12/02/the-ever-thorny-azerbaijani-armenian-dossier-a-territorial-dispute-with-broad-regional-implications/|title=The Ever-Thorny Azerbaijani-Armenian Dossier: A Territorial Dispute With Broad Regional Implications {{!}} Foreign Policy Journal|date=2014-12-02|work=Foreign Policy Journal|access-date=2017-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the territory of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijani sources insist that Armenian victory was largely due to military help from Russia and the wealthy [[Armenian diaspora]]. Armenians partially deny the allegation, claiming that Russian side was equally supplying Armenian and Azerbaijani sides with weapons and mercenaries. During the war, the Azeri armed forces were also aided by Turkish military advisers, and Russian, Ukrainian, Chechen and Afghan mercenaries.

===Non-combat deaths===
A number of Azerbaijani human rights groups have been tracking non-combat deaths and have noted an upward trend. Based on Defense Ministry statistics that had not been released to the public, the Group of Monitoring Compliance with Human Rights in the Army (GMCHRA) has recorded the deaths of 76 soldiers to date in non-combat incidents for 2011, and the injury of 91 others. In comparison, there were 62 non-combat deaths and 71 cases of injury in 2010. The string of non-combat deaths raises questions about the reform progress of the military. Factors behind the deaths include bullying, hazing, and the systemic corruption within the Azeri military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Azerbaijan: Non-Combat Deaths Put Military Reforms in Spotlight| url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/64508 | publisher=EurasiaNet |date=14 November 2011 | accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Land forces==
[[File:RSZO Smertch.jpg|right|thumb|Azerbaijan has a dozen 300mm salvo rocket systems 9A52 &quot;Smerch&quot; with a range of 70-{{convert|90|km|2|abbr=on}}.]]
The [[Azerbaijani Land Forces]] number 85,000 strong, according to UK [[Advanced Research and Assessment Group]] estimates.&lt;ref name=Blandy12 /&gt; The 2,500 men of the National Guard are also part of the ground forces. In addition, there are 300,000 former service personnel who have had military service in the last 15 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;IISS157&quot;/&gt; Other paramilitary agencies consist of Interior Ministry [[Internal Troops of Azerbaijan]], 12,000 strong, and the land component of the [[State Border Service (Azerbaijan)|State Border Service]], 5,000 strong.&lt;ref name=Blandy12 /&gt;

Azerbaijan has signed numerous contracts to strengthen its armed forces and to train its military with Turkey's assistance. Over the last 15 years, Azerbaijan has been preparing its military for possible action against Armenian forces in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]].

===Organization===
[[File:Azerbaijan Army 2007 OrBat.png|thumb|[[Azerbaijani Army]] Order of Battle]]
The Land Forces consist of five army corps:&lt;ref name=Blandy12 /&gt;
*1st Army Corps also known as Evlax Army Corps (concentrated near [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]])
*2nd Army Corps also known as Pirekeshkul Army Corps (concentrated against Armenian controlled territories and part is deployed on the Azerbaijan-Iranian border)
*3rd Army Corps also known as Shamkir Army Corps (concentrated against Armenian controlled territories)
*4th Army Corps also known as Baku Army Corps (covers [[Absheron Peninsula]] and the coast)
*5th Army Corps also known as Nakhchivan Army Corps (deployed in [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhichevan]])

The Land Forces include 23 motor rifle brigades, an artillery brigade, a multiple rocket launcher brigade, and an anti-tank regiment.&lt;ref name=Blandy12 /&gt; The IISS Military Balance reported in 2007 that the Land Forces had an estimated 40 SA-13 Gopher, SA-4 Ganef, and SA-8 Gecko air defence missile systems, with '80–240 eff.' to support the army in the battlefield. (IISS 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;157)

The [[Peacekeeping forces of Azerbaijan]] are mostly supplied from the Land Forces, though the [[Internal Troops of Azerbaijan]] do also supply some. As of March 2011, 94 peacekeepers were deployed with the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isaf.nato.int/images/stories/File/Placemats/PLACEMAT.MARCH%2004..pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, it also actively supported the peacekeeping operation in Kosovo and Iraq.

The Azeri [[Peacekeeping forces of Azerbaijan|peacekeeping unit]] deployed in Iraq consisted of 14 officers, 16 sergeants and 120 privates, a total of 150 troops. The unit secured the [[hydroelectric power station]] and reservoir in [[Haditha, Iraq|Al Haditha]] from August 2003. In December 2008, Azerbaijan withdrew the unit from Iraq.

Reportedly in December 2014 Azerbaijan created the 6th Army Corps in Nakhchivan. Karam Mustafayev became commander of the Special 6th Army Corps. The Special 6th Army Corps has been created based on the Nakhchivan 5th Army Corps to strengthen defense capability of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, increase of combat capability of military units and formations of the Armed Forces, improve central control, reports quoting the Defence Ministry said.

==Air forces==
The [[Azerbaijani Air and Air Defence Force]] is a single unified service branch.&lt;ref name=JSSA-MT&gt;Jane's Sentinel Security Assessments – Russia and the CIS: Air Force, dated 18 June 2009, and {{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |author2= |year=2008 |month= |title=World Defence Almanac  |journal=Military Technology |volume= XXXII |issue= 1 |pages=244–245|publisher=Monch Publishing Group |location=Bonn, Germany |issn=0722-3226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 8,000 men serve in the air force and air defence force.&lt;ref name=Blandy12 /&gt;

The Azerbaijani Air and Air Defence Force has around 106 aircraft and 35 helicopters.&lt;ref name=IISS158 /&gt; The country has four major airbases. [[Nasosnaya (air base)]] has fighters, [[Kyurdamir Air Base]] a bomber regiment, [[Ganja Air Base]] transports, and [[Baku Kala Air Base]] the helicopter unit. There are also four other airbases which do not appear to have aircraft based there. These are [[Dollyar Air Base]], [[Nakhichevan Airport]], [[Sanqacal]] Air Base, and [[Sitalcay]] Air Base.

The Azeri Air Force uses [[MiG-21]], [[MiG-23]], [[Su-24]] and [[Su-25]] aircraft, as well as the [[MiG-29]] purchased from Ukraine in 2006 and [[Il-76]] transport aircraft. The MiG-29 have been designated as the standard aircraft for the AzAF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.today.az/news/politics/38475.html Azerbaijan shows 4th generation MiG-29 multirole fighter jets.]&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijan is holding talks with either the People's Republic of China or Pakistan to purchase [[JF-17]] Thunder aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.am/eng/news/8954.html China supplies FC-1 multipurpose fighters to Azerbaijan]&lt;/ref&gt; [[MiG-25]]s previously in service have been retired seemingly in the 2007–09 period.

Azerbaijan's helicopter force is concentrated at [[Baku Kala Air Base]] and according to the IISS consists of a single regiment with around 14–15 Mi-24, 12–13 Mi-8 and 7 Mi-2. [[Jane's Information Group]] and the IISS give figures which agree with only a single aircraft's difference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www8.brinkster.com/vad777/sng/azerb/azerb.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928131441/http://www8.brinkster.com/vad777/sng/azerb/azerb.htm |date=28 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, end of 2010 Russian Rosvertol announced that Azerbaijan armed forces signed a deal for 24 pieces of Mi-35M (Hind-E) gunships what would further enhance the Azeri ground attack formations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/Azerbaijan-Orders-24-Mi-35M-Helicopter-Gunships-06789/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.helihub.com/2011/02/25/azerbaijan-buys-24-mi-35m-attack-helicopters/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air defense===
[[File:Military parade in Baku on an Army Day32.jpg|thumb|S-300 PMU2 during a military parade in Baku 2011.]]
Azerbaijan has missile and radar systems intended to defend Azeri airspace.

Also in Azerbaijan there was a former Soviet early warning radar. The [[Gabala Radar Station]] was a bistatic phased-array installation, operated by the [[Russian Space Forces]]. The contract was signed in 2002 and was due to expire in 2012 where it was to be given back to the Azerbaijani government. The contract costed Russia $7 million per year. The radar station had a range of up to {{convert|6000|km|mi|abbr=off}}, and was designed to detect [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] launches as far as from the Indian Ocean. In December 2012 Russia announced that negotiations had been unsuccessful and that they had stopped using the radar station.&lt;ref name=&quot;RIA-Nov7&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

===Training and education===
Azerbaijani pilots are trained in the Azerbaijan Air Force School and then developing their skills in operational units. Azerbaijan has an experience exchange with Turkey, Ukraine, the United States and a number of NATO countries. The Turkish Air Force School has a great role in the training of Azeri military pilots. Azerbaijani pilots are also trained in Ukraine's Pilot Training School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=97127 Azerbaijan’s military aviation opportunities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319233114/http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=97127 |date=19 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Navy==
The main naval base of the Soviet Union in the Caspian Sea was based in Baku. When the Soviet Union collapsed, Azerbaijan inherited the naval base and parts of the Caspian Fleet.&lt;ref name=&quot;nvo.ng&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nvo.ng.ru/forces/2007-08-31/3_nato.html|title=В фарватере НАТО |author=Константин Чуприн |date=31 August 2007 |work= |publisher= NVO NG|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Azerbaijan Navy]] has about 2,200 personnel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane's Fighting Ships]], 2010, accessed February 2010. IISS 2007 attributes 2,000 personnel&lt;/ref&gt; The navy has a [[Petya-class frigate|Petya class]] light frigate, ''Qusar'' (G 121), and a number of [[patrol craft]], including one Turk class, ''Araz,'' P 223, one Brya (Project 722) class, P 218, one Shelon (Project 1388M) class, P 212, one Poluchat class (Project 368), P 219, one Luga class (Project 888), T 710, and four Petrushka (Polish UK-3 class), P 213, P 214, P 215, and P 216. There are four [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s consisting of 2 [[Sonya class minesweeper]] and 2 [[Yevgenya class minesweeper]]s. (Jane's Fighting Ships 2010)

The U.S. Navy has helped train the Azeri Navy. There is also an agreement to provide US support to refurbish Azeri warships in the [[Caspian Sea]]. In 2006, the US Government donated 3 motorboats to the Azerbaijani navy. In 2007 an agreement between Azeri Navy and a US military company was concluded, which stated that a part of the Azeri Navy would be equipped with advanced laser marksmanship systems. The US company specialists were also to give training on the use of the new equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.today.az/news/politics/40483.html Azeri Navy to be equipped with marksmanship system lasers]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of separate U.S. programmes are underway under the [[Caspian Guard Initiative]], focused mostly on enhancing Azerbaijani and Kazakh maritime border security.

The [[Ministry of Defence Industry of Azerbaijan]] directs domestic military supplies for Azerbaijan. It was established in 2005. The Defence Industries Ministry subsumed the State Department for Military Industry and for Armaments and the Military Science Center, each of which was formerly a separate agency within the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry.

The defense industry has emerged as an autonomous entity with a growing defense production capability. The ministry is cooperating with the defense sectors of Ukraine, Belarus and Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/02/2b0bdd2d-49a6-4bff-826d-05edefe4dbdb.html Azerbaijan Defense Industry]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with other contracts, Azerbaijani defence industries and Turkish companies, Azerbaijan will produce 40mm revolver grenade launchers, 107mm and 122mm MLRS systems, Cobra 4×4 vehicles and joint modernization of BTR vehicles in Baku.&lt;ref name=&quot;brothership1&quot;&gt;[http://www.news.az/articles/politics/26065 Azerbaijan, Turkey to produce revolver grenade launchers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brothership2&quot;&gt;[http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=136785 Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Defense Industry plans to assume several projects on technical modernization of Armed Forces] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402090426/http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=136785 |date=2 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brothership3&quot;&gt;[http://www.news.az/articles/politics/25988 Azerbaijan, Turkey sign contract on joint rocket production]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brothership4&quot;&gt;[http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=136603 Azerbaijani Defense Industry Ministry conducts negotiations with Turkish &quot;Otokar&quot; Company on production of armored vehicles] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325182937/http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=136603 |date=25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, Azerbaijan had discussed the purchase of long-range rockets from two Chinese companies, the minister of the defence industry has said. Other arms deals were signed with Turkey. Turkish Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul and Yaver Jamalov signed a protocol of intent on future joint production of two types of output – 107-mm rockets and the national rifle, possibly the Mehmetçik-1. A protocol of intent was signed the same day with the Mechanical and Chemical Industry Corporation [[MKEK]] on the joint production of 120-mm mortar launchers. This project will come into force in a few months time. Agreement has also been reached with Turkish company Aselsan on the production of some types of defence output in Azerbaijan, specifically the latest types of weapons' sights. These projects will probably happen in the near future too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan to buy long-range rockets|url=http://www.news.az/articles/politics/36243|accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, Turkish defense industries secretariat told that an export version of the T-155 Firtina self-propelled howitser is almost done and could start production. T-155 has been powered by a German MTU power pack, which restricts the sale to some countries like Azerbaijan. The Turkish manufacturer MKEK, has announced that they have found an alternate supplier for the power pack where Azerbaijan showed interest to buy the high tech, more capable 155mm 52 caliber from Turkish authorities.

The [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) and Azerbaijan actively cooperate on defence institutional reforms and have developed practical cooperation in many other areas. Azerbaijan's [[Individual Partnership Action Plan]] (IPAP) and its [[Partnership for Peace]] (PfP) linkages lay out the programme of cooperation between Azerbaijan and NATO.

The Azerbaijani government has however delayed implementing IPAP-recommended reforms, however, in part at least because no decision had been taken to seek NATO membership. This is because Azerbaijan's foreign policy 'seeks to balance interests with the U.S., EU, Russia and Iran.'&lt;ref&gt;[[International Crisis Group]], Azerbaijan: Defence Sector Reform and Management, Europe Briefing No.50, Baku/Tblisi/Brussels, 29 October 2008, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a NATO diplomatic source some key officials at NATO headquarters in [[Brussel]]s were pushing hard for engaging Azerbaijan on the membership question. &quot;Turkey, Romania, Italy, Poland, the United Kingdom and the [[Baltic states]],&quot; are among the member-states also backing a fast track for Azerbaijan's NATO membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insightb/articles/eav060409.shtml EurasiaNet.org – Eurasia insight – Azerbaijan: Baku can leapfrog over Ukraine, Georgia for NATO membership]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Azerbaijan made its policy of [[non-belligerent|not being aligned]] with a geopolitical/military structure official when it became a full member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in 2011.

There is also a limited amount of military cooperation with the other countries of [[GUAM]]: Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Moldova.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perspektivy.info/rus/konturi/vojennoje_sotrudnichestvo_mezhdu_postsovetskimi_gosudarstvami_2008-09-25.htm Военное сотрудничество между постсоветскими государствами] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
