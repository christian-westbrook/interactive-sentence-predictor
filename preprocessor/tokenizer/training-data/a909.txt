==History==

===Founding===
[[File:Amway Japan Head Office.jpg|thumb|upright|Amway Japan Head Office]]
[[File:Honda- Amway アムウェイベトナム（AVCL）Hồ Chí Minh PB277728.jpg|thumb|upright|Amway Vietnam (Hồ Chí Minh City)]]

Jay Van Andel and Richard DeVos had been friends since school days and business partners in various endeavors, including a hamburger stand, an air charter service, and a sailing business. In 1949, they were introduced to the Nutrilite Products Corporation&lt;ref&gt;A California-based direct sales company founded by Carl Rehnborg, the developer of the first [[multivitamin]] marketed in the United States&lt;/ref&gt; by Van Andel's second cousin Neil Maaskant. DeVos and Van Andel signed up to become distributors for [[Nutrilite]] food supplements in August.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conn&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last= Conn|first= Charles Paul|title= The Possible Dream: A Candid Look At Amway|authorlink=Charles Paul Conn|publisher=[[Revell]] |year= 1977 |isbn= 0-8007-0857-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} They sold their first box the next day for $19.50, but lost interest for the next two weeks. They traveled to Chicago to attend a Nutrilite seminar soon after, at the urging of Maaskant, who had become their sponsor. They watched promotional filmstrips and listened to talks by company representatives and successful distributors, then they decided to pursue the Nutrilite business. They sold their second box of supplements on their return trip to Michigan, and rapidly proceeded to develop the business further.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conn&quot; /&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

Earlier in 1949, DeVos and Van Andel had formed the Ja-Ri Corporation (abbreviated from their respective first names) to import wooden goods from South American countries. After the Chicago seminar, they turned Ja-Ri into a Nutrilite distributorship instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Van Andel|first= Jay|title= An Enterprising Life|authorlink=Jay Van Andel|publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |year= 1998 |isbn= 0-88730-997-6|pages=37–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to profits on each product sold, Nutrilite offered [[Commission (remuneration)|commissions]] on sales made by new distributors introduced to the company by existing distributors—a system known as [[multi-level marketing]] or network marketing. By 1958, DeVos and Van Andel had built an organization of more than 5,000 distributors. However, they and some of their top distributors formed the American Way Association, or Amway, in April 1959 in response to concerns about the stability of Nutrilite and in order to represent the distributors and look for additional products to market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Robinson|first= James W.|title= Empire of Freedom: The Amway Story and What It Means to You|publisher=[[Prima Publishing]] |year= 1997 |isbn= 0-7615-1088-5|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their first product was called Frisk, a concentrated organic cleaner developed by a scientist in Ohio. DeVos and Van Andel bought the rights to manufacture and distribute Frisk, and later changed the name to LOC (Liquid Organic Cleaner).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

Amway bought control of Nutrilite in 1972 and full ownership in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5531851_ITM |title=Orange County, Calif., Firm Goes Back to Dawn of Vitamin Age |publisher=Accessmylibrary.com |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International expansion===
Amway expanded to Australia in 1971, to parts of Europe in 1973, to parts of Asia in 1974, to Japan in 1979, to Latin America in 1985, to [[Thailand]] in 1987, to China in 1995, to Africa in 1997, to India and Scandinavia in 1998, to [[Ukraine]] in 2003, to Russia in 2005, and to [[Vietnam]] in 2006.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===Quixtar===
{{Main article|Amway Global}}
In 1999 the founders of the Amway corporation established a new holding company, named [[Alticor]], and launched three new companies: a sister (and separate) Internet-focused company named [[Quixtar]], [[Access Business Group]], and Pyxis Innovations. Pyxis, later replaced by [[Fulton Innovation]], pursued research and development and [[Access Business Group]] handled manufacturing and logistics for Amway, Quixtar, and third-party clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2007706130458 |title=Amway marque to be revived; Quixtar label scrapped |publisher=The Detroit News |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main difference was that all &quot;Independent Business Owners&quot; (IBO) could order directly from Amway on the Internet, rather than from their [[upline]] &quot;direct distributor&quot;, and have products shipped directly to their home. The Amway name continued being used in the rest of the world. After virtually all Amway distributors in North America switched to Quixtar, Alticor elected to close Amway North America after 2001. In June 2007 it was announced that the Quixtar brand would be phased out over an 18- to 24-month period in favor of a unified Amway brand ([[Amway Global]]) worldwide.

In 2006, Quixtar published ''The Quixtar Independent Business Owner Compensation Plan'', in which the company reported that the average monthly gross income for &quot;Active&quot; IBOs was $115.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quixtar.com/documents/iwov/vis/010-en/pdf/IBO%20Support/BusForms/SA4400.pdf |title=Quixtar.com |format=PDF |accessdate=July 9, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110715140756/http://www.quixtar.com/documents/iwov/vis/010-en/pdf/IBO%20Support/BusForms/SA4400.pdf| archivedate= July 15, 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global markets==
According to the Amway website, {{as of|2011|lc=y}} the company operates in over 100 countries and territories, organized into regional markets: the Americas, Europe, greater China, Japan and Korea, and SE Asia/Australia. The top 10 markets for Amway in 2015 were China, South Korea, United States, Japan, Thailand, Russia, Malaysia, India and Ukraine.&lt;ref name=&quot;sales2015&quot; /&gt;

In 2008, Alticor announced that two-thirds of the company's 58 markets reported sales increases, including strong growth in the China, Russia, Ukraine and India markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS173002+05-Feb-2009+PRN20090205 |title=Amway Parent hits 50th year running recording 15% sales growth |agency=Reuters  |accessdate=July 9, 2011 |date=February 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amway China===
Amway China launched in 1995. In 1998, after abuses of illegal [[pyramid scheme]]s led to riots, the Chinese government enacted a ban on all [[direct selling]] companies, including Amway.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chinese officials ban direct marketing&quot;, April 22, 1998 [[Associated Press]], The Associated Press&lt;/ref&gt; After the negotiations, some companies like Amway, [[Avon Products, Inc.|Avon]], and [[Mary Kay]] continued to operate through a network of retail stores promoted by an independent sales force.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Once-barred Amway becomes booming business in China&quot;, Leslie Chang, March 12, 2003,  ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt; China introduced new direct selling laws in December 2005, and in December 2006 Amway was one of the first companies to receive a license to resume direct sales. However, the law forbids teachers, doctors, and civil servants from becoming direct sales agents for the company and, unlike in the United States, salespeople in China are ineligible to receive commissions from sales made by the distributors they recruit.

In 2006, Amway China had a reported 180,000 sales representatives, 140 stores, and $2&amp;nbsp;billion in annual sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/business/kzgazette/index.ssf?/base/business-3/116693763565130.xml&amp;coll=7 &quot;Amway, Mary Kay get long-awaited direct-selling licenses in China&quot;] Rob Kirkbride, December 24, 2006, ''[[Kalamazoo Gazette]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Amway Greater China and South-east Asia Chief Executive Eva Cheng was ranked No.88 by ''Forbes'' magazine in its list of the World's Most Powerful Women.&lt;ref name=&quot;ForbesWomen&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/11/biz_powerwomen08_Eva-Cheng_34MT.html |title=Forbes' The 100 Most Powerful Women; No.88 Eva Cheng |work=Forbes |accessdate=July 9, 2011 |date=August 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, China was Amway's largest market, reporting 28% growth and sales of 17&amp;nbsp;billion yuan (US$2.5 billion).&lt;ref name=LevinD&gt;{{cite news|last=Levin |first=Dan |title=Amway's China Redux |url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2009/0907/companies-sales-amway-china-redux.html |accessdate=17 May 2011 |newspaper=[[Forbes]] |date=August 27, 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829074138/http://www.forbes.com/global/2009/0907/companies-sales-amway-china-redux.html |archivedate=August 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report in ''Bloomberg Businessweek'' in April 2010, Amway had 237 retail shops in China, 160,000 direct sales agents, and $3&amp;nbsp;billion in revenue.&lt;ref name=EinhornB&gt;{{cite news|last=Einhorn|first=Bruce|title=Why Amway and China are a Good Fit|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_16/b4174064710167.htm|accessdate=June 16, 2011|newspaper=[[Businessweek]]|date=April 8, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110606102312/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_16/b4174064710167.htm| archivedate= June 6, 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brands==
Amway's product line grew from LOC, with the laundry detergent SA8 added in 1960, and later the hair care product Satinique (1965) and the cosmetics line [[Artistry (cosmetics)|Artistry]] (1968). Today Amway manufactures over 450 products, with manufacturing facilities in China, India and the United States, as well as Nutrilite organic farms in Brazil, Mexico and the United States (California and [[Washington (state)|Washington State]]). Amway brands include Artistry, Atmosphere, Body Blends, Bodykey, Body Works, Clear Now, eSpring, [[Glister (brand)|Glister]], iCook, Legacy of Clean, Nutrilite, Peter Island, Perfect Empowered Drinking Water, Personal Accents, Ribbon, Satinique, Artistry Men and [[XS Energy Drink|XS]].

In 2015, the vitamins and weight management products accounted for 46 percent of Alticor's sales. Beauty and personal care products represented 25 percent of sales while durable products, such as eSpring water treatment systems and Atmosphere air treatment systems, represented 16 percent of sales. Home care products generated 7 percent of sales.&lt;ref name=&quot;sales2015&quot; /&gt;

According to [[Euromonitor International]], Amway sells more products with a satisfaction guarantee than any other direct seller.&lt;ref name=&quot;euromonitor-amway-claims&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Amway Claims|url=http://www.euromonitor.com/amway-claims|website=www.euromonitor.com|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Household cleaners===
Amway is best known in North America for its original multi-purpose cleaning product LOC, SA8 laundry detergent, and Dish Drops dishwashing liquid. In the January 2007 issue of ''[[Consumer Reports]]'', SA8 with Bioquest was rated the best-performing laundry detergent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/home-garden/cooking-cleaning/laundry-detergents-1-07/overview/0107_soap_ov.htm |title=Laundry Detergents |publisher=Consumer Reports |date=July 1, 2011 |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Consumer Reports'' did, however, criticize SA8's pricing, a situation which was disputed by Amway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Rob Kirkbride / The Grand Rapids Press|title=Amway's old reliable cleans up|publisher=Grand Rapids Press, The (MI)|page=A1 |date= December 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer Reports conducted blind testing of detergents in 2010 and ranked versions of Amway's Legacy of Clean detergents 9th and 18th of 20 detergents tested. ''Consumer Reports'' program manager Pat Slaven recommended against buying the products because consumers can &quot;go to the grocery store and get something that performs a whole lot better for a whole lot less money&quot;.&lt;ref name=Odonnell2011&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Donnell|first= Jayne|title=Multilevel marketing or 'pyramid?'

==Ditto Delivery==
Ditto Delivery is Alticor's automatic, monthly replenishment program that fills orders based on customers' predetermined needs. As of May 2001, Ditto Delivery accounted for 30% of Quixtar's North American sales.&lt;ref name=forbes2001&gt;{{cite news|last=Bannan|first=Karen J|title=Amway.com |url=https://www.forbes.com/best/2001/0625/040.html |accessdate=May 17, 2011|work=[[Forbes]]|date=June 25, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business model==
Amway combines direct selling with a [[multi-level marketing]] strategy. Amway distributors, referred to as &quot;independent business owners&quot; (IBOs), may market products directly to potential customers and may also sponsor and mentor other people to become IBOs. IBOs may earn income both from the retail markup on any products they sell personally, plus a performance bonus based on the sales volume they and their downline (IBOs they have sponsored) have generated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Xardel&quot;/&gt; People may also register as IBOs to buy products at discounted prices. [[Harvard Business School]], which described Amway as &quot;one of the most profitable direct selling companies in the world&quot;, noted that Amway founders Van Andel and DeVos &quot;accomplished their success through the use of an elaborate pyramid-like distribution system in which independent distributors of Amway products received a percentage of the merchandise they sold and also a percentage of the merchandise sold by recruited distributors&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HarvardBS&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=American Business Leaders of the Twentieth Century – Richard M.

In December 2006, Alticor secured the [[naming rights]] for the [[Orlando Magic]]'s home basketball arena in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], Florida. The Orlando Magic are owned by the DeVos family. The arena, formerly known as the TD Waterhouse Centre, was renamed the [[Amway Arena]]. Its successor, the [[Amway Center]], was opened in 2010, and the older arena was demolished in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wesh.com/news/30141458/detail.html &quot;Amway Arena To Be Imploded&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214094203/http://www.wesh.com/news/30141458/detail.html |date=February 14, 2012 }} WESH.com Orlando&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Amway signed a three-year deal to be the presenting sponsor of the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Detroit Red Wings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/redwings/index.ssf/2011/09/red_wings_sign_multi-year_deal.html|title=Red Wings sign multi-year deal with Amway as its presenting sponsor|last=Khan|first=Ansar|date=September 2, 2011|publisher=[[Booth Newspapers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political contributions===
In the 1990s, the Amway organization was a major contributor to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] (GOP) and to the election campaigns of various GOP candidates. Amway and its sales force contributed a substantial amount (up to half) of the total funds ($669,525) for the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1994|1994 political campaign]] of Republican congresswoman and Amway distributor [[Sue Myrick]] (N.C.).&lt;ref name=burstein&gt;{{cite web| title = She Did it Amway | author=Rachel Burstein | magazine=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]| date = September–October 1996 | url = http://motherjones.com/politics/1996/09/she-did-it-amway| accessdate =May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to two reports by ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' magazine, Amway distributor Dexter Yager &quot;used the company's extensive voice-mail system to rally hundreds of Amway distributors into giving a total of $295,871&quot; to Myrick's campaign.&lt;ref name=burstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=zibrowski&gt;{{cite web| title = Tough sell| author=John Zibrowski, Jenna Ziman | magazine=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]| date = Nov–Dec 1998 | url = http://motherjones.com/politics/1998/11/tough-sell| accessdate =May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a campaign staffer quoted by the magazine, Myrick had appeared regularly on the Amway circuit, speaking at hundreds of rallies and selling $5 and $10 audiotapes.&lt;ref name=burstein/&gt; Following the 1994 election, Myrick maintained &quot;close ties to Amway and Yager&quot;, and raised $100,000 from Amway sources, &quot;most notably through fundraisers at the homes of big distributors&quot;, in the 1997–98 election cycle.&lt;ref name=zibrowski/&gt;

In October 1994, Amway gave the biggest corporate contribution recorded to that date to a political party for a single election, $2.5&amp;nbsp;million to the [[Republican National Committee]], and was the number one corporate political donor in the United States.&lt;ref name=burstein/&gt; In the [[2004 Elections|2004 election cycle]], the organization contributed a total of $4 million to a conservative [[527 group]], [[Progress for America]].&lt;ref&gt;From opensecrets.org: [http://www.opensecrets.org/527s/527cmtedetail.asp?ein=201170395&amp;cycle=2004&amp;format=&amp;tname=Progress+for+America Progress for America – Top Contributors, 2004 Cycle]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1996, Amway co-founder Richard DeVos was honored at a $3&amp;nbsp;million fundraiser for the Republican Party, and a week later, it was reported that Amway had tried to donate $1.3&amp;nbsp;million to pay for Republican &quot;infomercials&quot; and televising of the GOP convention on [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Family Channel]], but backed off when Democrats criticized the donation as a ploy to avoid campaign-finance restrictions.&lt;ref name=burstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=vlasic&gt;{{Cite news | last = Vlasic | first = Bill  |author2=Mary Beth Regan | title = Amway II: The Kids take over |work=BusinessWeek   | date = February 16, 1998 | url = http://www.businessweek.com/archives/1998/b3565099.arc.htm?chan=search  | accessdate =May 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1997 Richard DeVos and his wife, Helen, gave $1&amp;nbsp;million to the Republican National Committee (RNC),&lt;ref name=zibrowski/&gt;&lt;ref name=vlasic/&gt; which at the time was the second-largest [[Campaign finance in the United States|soft-money]] donation ever, behind Amway's 1994 gift of $2.5&amp;nbsp;million to the RNC.&lt;ref name=zibrowski/&gt; In July 1997, [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Trent Lott]] and [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]] slipped a last-minute provision into a hotly contested compromise tax bill that granted Amway and four other companies a tax break on their Asian branches that totaled $19&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=zibrowski/&gt;

[[Transaction Publishers]], 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Patralekha Bhattacharya and Krishna Kumar Mehta, of the consulting firm Thinkalytics, LLC, reasoned that although some critics have referred to organizations such as Amway as &quot;cults&quot; and have speculated that they engage in &quot;mind control&quot;, there are other explanations that could account for the behavior of distributors. Namely, continued involvement of distributors despite minimal economic return may result from social satisfaction compensating for diminished economic satisfaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;bhattacharye-mehta&quot;&gt;''Socialization in network marketing organizations: is it cult behavior?'' by Patralekha Bhattacharya and Krishna Kumar Mehta, Journal of Socio-Economics. 29(4):361–374.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pyramid scheme accusations==
[[Robert Todd Carroll|Robert Carroll]], of the ''[[Skeptic's Dictionary]]'', has described Amway as a &quot;legal pyramid scheme&quot;, and has said that the quasi-religious devotion of its affiliates is used by the company to conceal poor performance rates by distributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Robert Todd|authorlink1=Robert Todd Carroll|title=Amway|url=http://skepdic.com/amway.html|website=Skeptic's Dictionary|accessdate=February 24, 2015|date=July 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amway was ordered to accompany any such statements with the actual averages per distributor, pointing out that more than half of the distributors do not make any money, with the average distributor making less than $100 per month.

===Canadian tax fraud case===
In 1982, Amway co-founders, Richard M. DeVos and Jay Van Andel, along with Amway's executive vice president for corporate services, William J. Mr. Discher Jr., were indicted in Canada on several criminal charges, including allegations that they underreported the value of goods brought into the country and had defrauded the Canadian government of more than $28 million from 1965 to 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_111183&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Douglas|title=Amway admits fraud|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/11/business/amway-admits-fraud.html|accessdate=March 12, 2016|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=November 11, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ledger_031216&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Amway Pleads Guilty to Fraud|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wSUVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mvsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4697,3984825&amp;dq=amway+canada+fraud&amp;hl=en|accessdate=March 12, 2016|publisher=[[Lakeland Ledger]]|date=November 11, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CanadaTax&gt;{{Cite news

In 2007, Amway's operations were halted in the United Kingdom and Ireland following a yearlong investigation by the UK Department of Trade and Industry, which moved to have Amway banned on the basis that the company had employed deceptive marketing, presented inflated earnings estimates, and lured distributors into buying bogus &quot;motivation and training&quot; tools.&lt;ref name=&quot;FT_031116&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Pyramid scam alert|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/070722/FinancialTimes/ft319.html|accessdate=March 11, 2016|issue=42(8)|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date=July 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=UK threatens to ban Amway|first=Lee|last=Lupo|work=The Muskegon Chronicle|location=Grand Rapids|date=July 1, 2007|url=http://blog.mlive.com/chronicle/2007/07/united_kingdom_investigates_am.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a UK judge dismissed government claims against Amway's operations, saying major reforms in the prior year (which included banning non-Amway approved motivational events and materials) had fixed company faults that favored selling training materials over products and misrepresented earnings. However, the judge also expressed his belief that Amway allowed &quot;misrepresentations&quot; of its business by independent sellers in years past and failed to act decisively against the misrepresentations.&lt;ref name=&quot;MLive_031116&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Knape|first1=Chris|title=U.K. judge dismisses claims against Amway|url=http://blog.mlive.com/grpress/2008/05/uk_dismisses_claims_against_am.html|accessdate=March 11, 2016|publisher=MLive Media Group|date=May 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Amway Poland and [[Network TwentyOne]] separately sued the makers of a Polish film, ''Welcome to Life'' ({{lang-pl|Witajcie w zyciu}}), for defamation and copyright violations.

In 2001 a regional court ruled in favor of Network 21; however, in 2004 the Warsaw Regional Court dismissed Amway's civil lawsuit.

On December 18, 2012, the court ruled that film can be screened, but the makers have to remove &quot;untrue information&quot;, as the screen near the end of the movie stated that 30% of company income is generated by sales of training materials and that the vast majority of its profits are shared only by the tiny fraction of top distributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrzej Biernat, poseł PO o zachowaniu Jarosława Gowina |url=http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,114871,13073248,Koniec_procesu_ws__Amway__TVP_moze_pokazac_film__ale.html#BoxWiadTxt?lokale=wroclaw |title=Wiadomości – Gazeta.pl |language=pl |publisher=Wiadomosci.gazeta.pl |date= |accessdate=2013-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not the only court case, so the film is still banned on other grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,114883,13074755,Rezyser_filmu_o_Amwayu_szczerze_o_wyroku__Nikt_nic.html#BoxWiadTxt?lokale=wroclaw |title=Reżyser filmu o Amwayu szczerze o wyroku: Nikt nic nie rozumie, czyli 'Witajcie w życiu' [WYWIAD&amp;#93; |language=pl |publisher=Wiadomosci.gazeta.pl |date=2012-12-18 |accessdate=2013-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| accessdate =July 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report noted that the average distributor makes only about $1,400 per year and that many of the &quot;high level distributors singing the praises of Quixtar&quot; are actually &quot;making most of their money by selling motivational books, tapes and seminars; not Quixtar's cosmetics, soaps, and electronics&quot;.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;In fact, about twenty high level distributors are part of an exclusive club; one that those hundreds of thousands of other distributors don't get to join. For years only a privileged few, including Bill Britt, have run hugely profitable businesses selling all those books, tapes and seminars; things the rank and file distributors can't sell themselves but, are told over and over again, they need to buy in order to succeed.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The program said that a Quixtar recruiter featured in the report made misleading and inconsistent statements about Quixtar earnings during a recruitment meeting and had an outstanding [[arrest warrant]] for cocaine possession from the mid-90s.&lt;ref name=DATELINE/&gt;
