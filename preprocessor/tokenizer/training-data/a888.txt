'''Acetylene''' ([[Chemical nomenclature|systematic name]]: '''ethyne''') is the [[chemical compound]] with the formula C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a [[hydrocarbon]] and the simplest [[alkyne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=R. H. Petrucci |author2=W. S. Harwood |author3=F. G. Herring | title = General Chemistry | edition = 8th | publisher = Prentice-Hall | date = 2002 | page = 1072}}&lt;/ref&gt; This colorless gas is widely used as a fuel and a chemical building block. It is unstable in its pure form and thus is usually handled as a solution.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; Pure acetylene is odorless, but commercial grades usually have a marked odor due to impurities.&lt;ref name=msds&gt;Compressed Gas Association (1995) [http://www.stoodyind.com/Safety/MSDS/Acetylene.pdf Material Safety and Data Sheet – Acetylene] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711030340/http://www.stoodyind.com/safety/msds/Acetylene.pdf |date=11 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an alkyne, acetylene is [[Saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] because its two carbon atoms are [[Chemical bond|bonded]] together in a [[triple bond]]. The carbon–carbon triple bond places all four atoms in the same straight line, with CCH bond angles of 180°.&lt;ref&gt;Whitten K.W., Gailey K.D. and Davis R.E.

==Discovery==
Acetylene was discovered in 1836 by [[Edmund Davy]], who identified it as a &quot;new carburet of hydrogen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Davy (August 1836) [https://books.google.com/books?id=grtZAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA62#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false &quot;Notice of a new gaseous bicarburet of hydrogen,&quot;], ''Report of the Sixth Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science'' … , '''5''' :  62-63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was rediscovered in 1860 by French chemist [[Marcellin Berthelot]], who coined the name &quot;acétylène&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bertholet (1860) [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3007r/f817.image &quot;Note sur une nouvelle série de composés organiques, le quadricarbure d'hydrogène et ses dérivés&quot;] (Note on a new series of organic compounds, tetra-carbon hydride and its derivatives), ''Comptes rendus'', series 3, '''50''' :  805–808.&lt;/ref&gt;
Berthelot's empirical formula for acetylene (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), as well as the alternative name &quot;quadricarbure d'hydrogène&quot; (''hydrogen quadricarbide'') were incorrect because chemists at that time used the wrong atomic mass for carbon (6 instead of 12).{{cn|date=April 2017}}
Berthelot was able to prepare this gas by passing vapours of organic compounds (methanol, ethanol, etc.) through a red-hot tube and collecting the [[effluent]]. He also found acetylene was formed by sparking electricity through mixed [[cyanogen]] and [[hydrogen]] gases. Berthelot later obtained acetylene directly by passing hydrogen between the poles of a [[arc lamp|carbon arc]].&lt;ref&gt;Berthelot (1862) [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k30115/f640.image.langEN &quot;Synthèse de l'acétylène par la combinaison directe du carbone avec l'hydrogène&quot;] (Synthesis of acetylene by the direct combination of carbon with hydrogen), ''Comptes rendus'', series 3, '''54''' :  640-644.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chestofbooks.com/crafts/metal/Welding-Cutting/Acetylene.html Acetylene]&lt;/ref&gt; Commercially available acetylene gas could smell foul due to the common impurities [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[phosphine]]. However, as purity increases it will become odourless.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Preparation==
Since the 1950s, acetylene has mainly been manufactured by the partial [[combustion]] of [[methane]]&lt;ref name=Ullmann /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Habil|first1=Phil|last2=Sachsse|first2=Hans|title=Herstellung von Acetylen durch unvollständige Verbrennung von Kohlenwasserstoffen mit Sauerstoff [Production of acetylene by incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons with oxygen]|journal=Chemie Ingenieur Technik|date=1954|volume=26|issue=5|pages=245–253|doi=10.1002/cite.330260502}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Habil|first1=Phil|last2=Bartholoméa|first2=E.|title=Probleme großtechnischer Anlagen zur Erzeugung von Acetylen nach dem Sauerstoff-Verfahren [Problems of large-scale plants for the production of acetylene by the oxygen method]|journal=Chemie Ingenieur Technik|date=1954|volume=26|issue=5|pages=253–258|doi=10.1002/cite.330260503}}&lt;/ref&gt; or appears as a side product in the [[ethylene]] stream from [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] of [[hydrocarbon]]s.

It is selectively hydrogenated into [[ethylene]], usually using Pd–Ag catalysts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.enotes.com/how-products-encyclopedia/acetylene Acetylene: How Products are Made] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070120055804/http://science.enotes.com/how-products-encyclopedia/acetylene |date=20 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1950s, when [[petroleum|oil]] supplanted [[coal]] as the chief source of [[redox|reduced]] carbon, acetylene (and the aromatic fraction from [[coal tar]]) was the main source of organic chemicals in the chemical industry. It was prepared by the [[hydrolysis]] of [[calcium carbide]], a reaction discovered by [[Friedrich Wöhler]] in 1862&lt;ref&gt;Wohler (1862) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6zIzAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA220#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false &quot;Bildung des Acetylens durch Kohlenstoffcalcium&quot;] (Formation of actylene by calcium carbide), ''Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie'', '''124''' :  220.&lt;/ref&gt; and still familiar to students:
: CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Calcium carbide production requires extremely high temperatures, ~2000&amp;nbsp;°C, necessitating the use of an [[electric arc furnace]]. In the US, this process was an important part of the late-19th century revolution in chemistry enabled by the massive [[hydroelectric power]] project at [[Niagara Falls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freeman|first=Horace|title=Manufacture of Cyanamide|journal=The Chemical News and the Journal of Physical Science|year=1919|volume=117|page=232|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5SAzAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA232&amp;dq=calcium+carbide&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hpy3UoPBJIrqoASRxYKwCA&amp;ved=0CHEQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=calcium%20carbide&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bonding==
In terms of [[valence bond theory]], in each carbon atom the 2s [[Atomic orbital|orbital]] [[Orbital hybridisation|hybridizes]] with one 2p orbital thus forming an sp hybrid. The other two 2p orbitals remain unhybridized. The two ends of the two sp hybrid [[orbital overlap]] to form a strong [[Sigma bond|σ valence bond]] between the carbons, while on each of the other two ends hydrogen atoms attach also by σ bonds. The two unchanged 2p orbitals form a pair of weaker [[pi bond|π bonds]].&lt;ref&gt;Organic Chemistry 7th ed. by J. McMurry, Thomson 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Since acetylene is a linear [[molecular symmetry|symmetrical molecule]], it possesses the D&lt;sub&gt;∞h&lt;/sub&gt; [[Molecular symmetry#Point group|point group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Housecroft3rd|pages=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical properties==

===Changes of state===
At atmospheric pressure, acetylene cannot exist as a liquid and does not have a melting point. The [[triple point]] on the [[phase diagram]] corresponds to the melting point (−80.8&amp;nbsp;°C) at the minimum pressure at which liquid acetylene can exist (1.27 atm). At temperatures below the triple point, solid acetylene can change directly to the [[vapour]] (gas) by [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]. The sublimation point at atmospheric pressure is −84.0°C.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Chemistry and Physics (60th ed., CRC Press 1979-80), p.C-303 in Table ''Physical Constants of Organic Compounds'' (listed as ''ethyne'')&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
The [[adiabatic]] flame temperature in air at [[atmospheric pressure]] is 2534&amp;nbsp;°C. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Acetylene gas can be dissolved in [[acetone]] or [[dimethylformamide]] in room temperature and 1 atm. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Reactions==

===Metal acetylides===
{{Main article|Acetylide#Preparation}}

Since acetylene has a [[Acid dissociation constant|pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] of 25, acetylene can be [[deprotonation|deprotonated]] by a [[superbase]] to form an [[acetylide]]:&lt;ref name=Viehe&gt;{{cite book|last1=Viehe|first1=Heinz Günter|title=Chemistry of Acetylenes|date=1969|publisher=Marcel Dekker, inc.|location=New York|pages=170–179 &amp; 225–241|edition=1st|doi=10.1002/ange.19720840843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of the acetylide depends upon several factors such as the [[Acid dissociation constant#Bases and basicity|pK&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;]] of the base, the [[Valence (chemistry)|valency]] of the metal, and [[solvent]] characteristics.&lt;ref name=Viehe /&gt;

==Applications==

===Welding===
Approximately 20 percent of acetylene is supplied by the [[Industrial gas|industrial gases industry]] for [[oxyacetylene]] [[gas welding]] and [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|cutting]] due to the high temperature of the flame; combustion of acetylene with oxygen produces a flame of over {{convert|3600|K|C F}}, releasing 11.8&amp;nbsp;[[Kilojoule|kJ]]/g. Oxyacetylene is the hottest burning common fuel gas.&lt;ref name=Linde2013&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linde-gas.com/en/products_and_supply/gases_fuel/acetylene.html |title=Acetylene |accessdate=November 30, 2013 |publisher=Linde |website=Products and Supply &gt; Fuel Gases }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Acetylene is the third-hottest natural chemical flame after [[dicyanoacetylene]]'s {{convert|5260|K|C F}} and [[cyanogen]] at {{convert|4798|K|C F}}. [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|Oxy-acetylene welding]] was a very popular welding process in previous decades; however, the development and advantages of [[arc welding|arc-based welding processes]] have made oxy-fuel welding nearly extinct for many applications. Acetylene usage for welding has dropped significantly. On the other hand, oxy-acetylene welding ''equipment'' is quite versatile – not only because the torch is preferred for some sorts of iron or steel welding (as in certain artistic applications), but also because it lends itself easily to brazing, braze-welding, metal heating (for annealing or tempering, bending or forming), the loosening of corroded nuts and bolts, and other applications. [[Bell Canada]] cable repair technicians still use portable acetylene fuelled torch kits as a [[soldering]] tool for sealing lead sleeve splices in [[manhole]]s and in some aerial locations. Oxyacetylene welding may also be used in areas where electricity is not readily accessible. As well, oxy-fuel cutting is still very popular and oxy-acetylene cutting is utilized in nearly every metal fabrication shop. For use in welding and cutting, the working pressures must be controlled by a regulator, since above 15 psi,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c-f-c.com/specgas_products/acetylene.htm Acetylene - Properties, Purity and Packaging - Acetylene is simplest member of unsaturated hydrocarbons called alkynes or acetylenes.

===Portable lighting===
[[Calcium carbide]] was used to generate acetylene used in the lamps for portable or remote applications.  It was used for miners and cavers before the widespread use of [[Incandescent light bulb|incandescent lighting]]; or many years later low-power/high-lumen LED lighting; and is still used by mining industries in some nations without workplace safety laws.  It was also used as an early light source for lighthouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uslhs.org/lighthouse-lamps-through-time|title=Lighthouse Lamps Through Time by Thomas Tag {{!}} US Lighthouse Society|website=uslhs.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plastics and acrylic acid derivatives===
Except in China, use of acetylene as a chemical feedstock has declined by 70% from 1965 to 2007 owing to cost and environmental considerations.
Acetylene can be [[semihydrogenation|semihydrogenated]] to [[ethylene]], providing a feedstock for a variety of [[polyethylene]] plastics. Another major application of acetylene, especially in China is its conversion to [[acrylic acid]] [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; These derivatives form products such as [[acrylic fiber]]s, [[Acrylic glass|glass]]es, [[Acrylic paint|paint]]s, [[Acrylic resin|resin]]s, and [[Acrylate polymer|polymer]]s.&lt;ref name=Takashi /&gt;

===Niche applications===
In 1881, the Russian chemist Mikhail Kucherov&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/cber.188101401320|title=Ueber eine neue Methode direkter Addition von Wasser (Hydratation) an die Kohlenwasserstoffe der Acetylenreihe|year=1881|last1=Kutscheroff|first1=M.|journal=Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft|volume=14|pages=1540–1542}}&lt;/ref&gt; described the [[Hydration reaction|hydration]] of acetylene to [[acetaldehyde]] using catalysts such as [[mercury(II) bromide]]. Before the advent of the [[Wacker process]], this reaction was conducted on an industrial scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Hydration of Acetylene: A 125th Anniversary |author1=Dmitry A.

The [[polymerization]] of acetylene with [[Ziegler-Natta catalyst]]s produces [[polyacetylene]] films. Polyacetylene, a chain of CH centres with alternating single and double bonds, was one of the first discovered [[organic semiconductor]]s. Its reaction with [[iodine]] produces a highly electrically conducting material. Although such materials are not useful, these discoveries led to the developments of [[organic semiconductor]]s, as recognized by the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 2000 to [[Alan J. Heeger]], [[Alan G MacDiarmid]], and [[Hideki Shirakawa]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

In the early 20th century acetylene was widely used for illumination, including street lighting in some towns.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0AnJU-hralEC The 100 most important chemical compounds: a reference guide]&lt;/ref&gt; Most early automobiles used [[carbide lamp]]s before the adoption of electric headlights. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Acetylene is sometimes used for [[carburization]] (that is, hardening) of steel when the object is too large to fit into a furnace.&lt;ref name=BOC2006&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boc.com/products_and_services/by_product/acetylene/index.asp |title=Acetylene |publisher=BOC |website=Products and Services |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517074022/http://boc.com/products_and_services/by_product/acetylene/index.asp |archivedate=17 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acetylene is used to volatilize carbon in [[radiocarbon dating]]. The carbonaceous material in an archeological sample is treated with [[lithium]] metal in a small specialized research furnace to form [[lithium carbide]] (also known as lithium acetylide). The carbide can then be reacted with water, as usual, to form acetylene gas to be fed into [[mass spectrometer]] to measure the isotopic ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Geyh, Mebus|title=Radiocarbon dating problems using acetylene as counting gas|journal=Radiocarbon|year=1990|volume=32|issue=3|pages=321–324|doi=10.2458/azu_js_rc.32.1278|url=https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/1278/1283|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural occurrence==
The energy richness of the C≡C triple bond and the rather high solubility of acetylene in water make it a suitable substrate for bacteria, provided an adequate source is available {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. A number of bacteria living on acetylene have been identified. The [[enzyme]] [[acetylene hydratase]] catalyzes the hydration of acetylene to give acetaldehyde.&lt;ref&gt;

Acetylene is a moderately common chemical in the universe, often associated with the atmospheres of [[gas giant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=[[W. M. Keck Observatory]] |title=Precursor to Proteins and DNA found in Stellar Disk |date=20 December 2005 |url=http://www.keckobservatory.org/article.php?id=39 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223211405/http://www.keckobservatory.org/article.php?id=39 |archivedate=23 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One curious discovery of acetylene is on [[Enceladus]], a moon of [[Saturn]]. Natural acetylene is believed to form from [[Catalysis|catalytic]] decomposition of long-chain hydrocarbons at temperatures of {{convert|1700|K|C F}} and above. Since such temperatures are highly unlikely on such a small distant body, this discovery is potentially suggestive of catalytic reactions within that moon, making it a promising site to search for prebiotic chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[The Planetary Society]] |author =Emily Lakdawalla |title=LPSC: Wednesday afternoon: Cassini at Enceladus |date=17 March 2006 |url=http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000498/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220053655/http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000498/ |archivedate=20 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=445 | pages=376–377| date= 25 January 2007| doi = 10.1038/445376b| title= Planetary science: Inside Enceladus|author1=John Spencer |author2=David Grinspoon |pmid=17251967|issue=7126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety and handling==
Acetylene is not especially toxic but, when generated from [[calcium carbide]], it can contain toxic impurities such as traces of [[phosphine]] and [[arsine]], which give it a distinct garlic-like smell {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. It is also highly flammable, as most light hydrocarbons, hence its use in welding. Its most singular hazard is associated with its intrinsic instability, especially when it is pressurized: under certain conditions acetylene can react in an [[exothermic]] addition-type reaction to form a number of products, typically [[benzene]] and/or [[vinylacetylene]], possibly in addition to [[carbon]] and [[hydrogen]] {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. Consequently, acetylene, if initiated by intense heat or a shockwave, can decompose explosively if the absolute pressure of the gas exceeds about {{convert|200|kPa|psi}}. Most regulators and pressure gauges on equipment report [[gauge pressure]] and the safe limit for acetylene therefore is 101 kPa&lt;sub&gt;gage&lt;/sub&gt; or 15 psig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.c-f-c.com/specgas_products/acetylene.htm | title = Acetylene Specification | accessdate = 2012-05-02 | publisher = CFC StarTec LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://law.resource.org/pub/us/cfr/ibr/003/cga.g-1.2009.pdf|title=law.resource.org CGA g-1 2009 (incorporated by reference)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore supplied and stored dissolved in [[acetone]] or [[dimethylformamide]] (DMF),&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Industrial Gases&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Downie | first1 = N.
