{{Periodic table (alkali metals)}}
The '''alkali metals''' are a [[group (periodic table)|group]] (column) in the [[periodic table]] consisting of the [[chemical element]]s [[lithium]] (Li), [[sodium]] (Na), [[potassium]] (K),&lt;ref group=note&gt;The symbols '''Na''' and '''K''' for sodium and potassium are derived from their [[Latin name]]s, ''natrium'' and ''kalium''; these are still the names for the elements in some languages, such as German and Russian.&lt;/ref&gt; [[rubidium]] (Rb), [[caesium]] (Cs),{{refn|''Caesium'' is the spelling recommended by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{RedBook2005|pages=248–49}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Chemical Society]] (ACS) has used the spelling ''cesium'' since 1921,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first= Anne M. |editor1-last= Coghill |editor2-first= Lorrin R. |editor2-last= Garson |year= 2006 |title= The ACS Style Guide: Effective Communication of Scientific Information |edition= 3rd |publisher= American Chemical Society |location= Washington, D.C. |isbn= 0-8412-3999-1 |page= 127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Pure Appl.

This group lies in the [[s-block]] of the periodic table of elements as all alkali metals have their outermost electron in an [[atomic orbital|s-orbital]]: this shared electron configuration results in them having very similar characteristic properties. Indeed, the alkali metals provide the best example of [[periodic trends|group trends]] in properties in the periodic table, with elements exhibiting well-characterised [[homology (chemistry)|homologous]] behaviour.

The alkali metals are all shiny, [[hardness|soft]], highly [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] metals at [[standard temperature and pressure]] and readily lose their [[valence electron|outermost electron]] to form [[cation]]s with [[electric charge|charge]] +1. They can all be cut easily with a knife due to their softness, exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to [[redox|oxidation]] by atmospheric moisture and [[oxygen]] (and in the case of lithium, [[nitrogen]]). Because of their high reactivity, they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air, and are found naturally only in [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] and never as the free elements. Caesium, the fifth alkali metal, is the most reactive of all the metals.&lt;!--YES, NOT FRANCIUM. SEE BELOW.--&gt; In the modern [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] nomenclature, the alkali metals comprise the '''group 1 elements''',{{refn|In both the old IUPAC and the [[Chemical Abstracts Service|CAS]] systems for group numbering, this group is known as '''group IA''' (pronounced as &quot;group one A&quot;, as the &quot;I&quot; is a [[Roman numeral]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fluck |first1=E. |year=1988 |title=New Notations in the Periodic Table |journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry|Pure Appl.

All the alkali metals react with water, with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones.

All of the discovered alkali metals occur in nature as their compounds: in order of [[abundance of the chemical elements|abundance]], sodium is the most abundant, followed by potassium, lithium, rubidium, caesium, and finally francium, which is very rare due to its extremely high [[radioactivity]]; francium occurs only in the minutest [[trace radioisotope|traces]] in nature as an intermediate step in some obscure side branches of the natural [[decay chain]]s. Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of [[ununennium]] (Uue), which is likely to be the next member of the group, but they have all met with failure. However, ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of [[superheavy element]]s; even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal, it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues.

Most alkali metals have many different applications. One of the best-known applications of the pure elements is the use of rubidium and caesium in [[atomic clock]]s, of which caesium atomic clocks are the most accurate and precise representation of time. A common application of the compounds of sodium is the [[sodium-vapour lamp]], which emits light very efficiently. [[Salt|Table salt]], or sodium chloride, has been used since antiquity. Sodium and potassium are also [[essential element]]s, having major biological roles as [[electrolyte]]s, and although the other alkali metals are not essential, they also have various effects on the body, both beneficial and harmful.

=== Physical and chemical ===
The physical and chemical properties of the alkali metals can be readily explained by their having an ns&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; valence [[electron configuration]], which results in weak [[metallic bonding]]. Hence, all the alkali metals are soft and have low [[density|densities]],&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; [[melting point|melting]]&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; and [[boiling point]]s,&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; as well as [[heat of sublimation|heats of sublimation]], [[heat of vaporization|vaporisation]], and [[heat of dissociation|dissociation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|74}} They all crystallise in the [[body-centered cubic]] crystal structure,&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|73}} and have distinctive [[flame test|flame colours]] because their outer s electron is very easily excited.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|75}} The ns&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; configuration also results in the alkali metals having very large [[atomic radius|atomic]] and [[ionic radius|ionic radii]], as well as very high [[thermal conductivity|thermal]] and [[electrical conductivity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|75}} Their chemistry is dominated by the loss of their lone valence electron in the outermost s-orbital to form the +1 oxidation state, due to the ease of ionising this electron and the very high second ionisation energy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|76}} Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group. The chemistry of francium is not well established due to its extreme [[radioactive decay|radioactivity]];&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; thus, the presentation of its properties here is limited. What little is known about francium shows that it is very close in behaviour to caesium, as expected. The physical properties of francium are even sketchier because the bulk element has never been observed; hence any data that may be found in the literature are certainly speculative extrapolations.&lt;ref name=RubberBible84th /&gt;

The alkali metals are more similar to each other than the elements in any other [[group (periodic table)|group]] are to each other.&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; Indeed, the similarity is so great that it is quite difficult to separate potassium, rubidium, and caesium, due to their similar [[ionic radius|ionic radii]]; lithium and sodium are more distinct. For instance, when moving down the table, all known alkali metals show increasing [[atomic radius]],&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt; decreasing [[electronegativity]],&lt;ref name=chemguide&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group1/properties.html |title=Atomic and Physical Properties of the Group 1 Elements |last=Clark|first=Jim |year=2005 |work=chemguide |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; increasing [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]],&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; and decreasing melting and boiling points&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt; as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|75}} In general, their [[density|densities]] increase when moving down the table, with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium.&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt; One of the very few properties of the alkali metals that does not display a very smooth trend is their [[reduction potential]]s: lithium's value is anomalous, being more negative than the others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|75}} This is because the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion has a very high [[hydration energy]] in the gas phase: though the lithium ion disrupts the structure of water significantly, causing a higher change in entropy, this high hydration energy is enough to make the reduction potentials indicate it as being the most electropositive alkali metal, despite the difficulty of ionising it in the gas phase.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|75}}

In aqueous solution, the alkali metal ions form [[metal ions in aqueous solution|aqua ions]] of the formula [M(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''n'' is the solvation number. Their [[coordination number]]s and shapes agree well with those expected from their ionic radii. In aqueous solution the water molecules directly attached to the metal ion are said to belong to the [[first coordination sphere]], also known as the first, or primary, solvation shell. The bond between a water molecule and the metal ion is a [[dative covalent bond]], with the oxygen atom donating both electrons to the bond. Each coordinated water molecule may be attached by [[hydrogen bond]]s to other water molecules. The latter are said to reside in the second coordination sphere. However, for the alkali metal cations, the second coordination sphere is not well-defined as the +1 charge on the cation is not high enough to [[Polarizability|polarise]] the water molecules in the primary solvation shell enough for them to form strong hydrogen bonds with those in the second coordination sphere, producing a more stable entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burgess |first=John |title=Metal Ions in Solution |year=1978 |publisher=Ellis Horwood |location=Chichester |page=20 |isbn=0-85312-027-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Richens /&gt;{{rp|25}} The solvation number for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; has been experimentally determined to be 4, forming the [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] [Li(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;: while solvation numbers of 3 to 6 have been found for lithium aqua ions, solvation numbers less than 4 may be the result of the formation of contact [[ion pair]]s, and the higher solvation numbers may be interpreted in terms of water molecules that approach [Li(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; through a face of the tetrahedron, though molecular dynamic simulations may indicate the existence of an [[octahedron|octahedral]] hexaaqua ion.

==== Lithium ====
The chemistry of lithium shows several differences from that of the rest of the group as the small Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation [[chemical polarity|polarises]] [[anion]]s and gives its compounds a more [[covalent bond|covalent]] character.&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; Lithium and [[magnesium]] have a [[diagonal relationship]] due to their similar atomic radii,&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; so that they show some similarities. For example, lithium forms a stable [[nitride]], a property common among all the [[alkaline earth metal]]s (magnesium's group) but unique among the alkali metals.&lt;ref name=&quot;alkalireact&quot; /&gt; In addition, among their respective groups, only lithium and magnesium form [[organometallic compound]]s with significant covalent character (e.g. Li[[methyl group|Me]] and MgMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Shriver&amp;Atkins&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Inorganic Chemistry |first1=Duward |last1=Shriver |first2=Peter |last2=Atkins |publisher=W.

Lithium fluoride is the only alkali metal halide that is poorly soluble in water,&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; and [[lithium hydroxide]] is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not [[deliquescent]].&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; Conversely, [[lithium perchlorate]] and other lithium salts with large anions that cannot be polarised are much more stable than the analogous compounds of the other alkali metals, probably because Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; has a high [[solvation energy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|76}} This effect also means that most simple lithium salts are commonly encountered in hydrated form, because the anhydrous forms are extremely [[hygroscopic]]: this allows salts like [[lithium chloride]] and [[lithium bromide]] to be used in [[dehumidifier]]s and [[air-conditioner]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|76}}

==== Francium ====
Francium is also predicted to show some differences due to its high [[atomic weight]], causing its electrons to travel at considerable fractions of the speed of light and thus making [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]] more prominent. In contrast to the trend of decreasing [[electronegativity|electronegativities]] and [[ionisation energy|ionisation energies]] of the alkali metals, francium's electronegativity and ionisation energy are predicted to be higher than caesium's due to the relativistic stabilisation of the 7s electrons; also, its [[atomic radius]] is expected to be abnormally low.&lt;!--Haire says this happens for Uue because of the analogous effect for 8s – seems likely for Fr too--&gt; Thus, contrary to expectation, caesium is the most reactive of the alkali metals, not francium.&lt;ref name=&quot;andreev&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= The Chemistry of the Actinide and Transactinide Elements |editor1-last= Morss|editor2-first= Norman M. |editor2-last= Edelstein |editor3-last= Fuger|editor3-first= Jean |last1= Hoffman|first1= Darleane C. |last2=Lee|first2=Diana M. |last3=Pershina|first3=Valeria |chapter= Transactinides and the future elements |publisher= Springer |year= 2006 |isbn= 1-4020-3555-1 |location= Dordrecht, The Netherlands |edition= 3rd }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1729}}&lt;ref name=Thayer /&gt; All known physical properties of francium also deviate from the clear trends going from lithium to caesium, such as the first ionisation energy, electron affinity, and anion polarisability, though due to the paucity of known data about francium many sources give extrapolated values, ignoring that relativistic effects make the trend from lithium to caesium become inapplicable at francium.&lt;ref name=Thayer /&gt; Some of the few properties of francium that have been predicted taking relativity into account are the electron affinity (47.2 kJ/mol)&lt;ref name=Landaualkalis&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Landau |first1= A. |last2= Eliav |first2= E. |last3= Ishikawa |first3= Y. |last4= Kaldor |first4= U. |year= 2001 |title= Benchmark calculations of electron affinities of the alkali atoms sodium to eka-francium (element 119) |url= https://www.academia.edu/20466410|journal= J.

All the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers; hence, their isotopes must be either [[odd–odd nuclei|odd–odd]] (both proton and [[neutron number]] are odd) or [[odd–even nuclei|odd–even]] ([[proton number]] is odd, but neutron number is even). Odd–odd nuclei have even [[mass number]]s, whereas odd–even nuclei have odd mass numbers. Odd–odd [[primordial nuclide]]s are rare because most odd–odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to [[beta decay]], because the decay products are even–even, and are therefore more strongly bound, due to [[Semi-empirical mass formula#Pairing term|nuclear pairing effects]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lide02&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Various authors|editor-last=Lide |editor-first=David R. |year=2002 |title=Handbook of Chemistry &amp; Physics |edition=88th |publisher=CRC |url=http://www.hbcpnetbase.com/ |accessdate=2008-05-23 |isbn=0-8493-0486-5 |oclc=179976746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the great rarity of odd–odd nuclei, almost all the primordial isotopes of the alkali metals are odd–even (the exceptions being the light stable isotope lithium-6 and the long-lived [[radioisotope]] potassium-40). For a given odd mass number, there can be only a single [[beta-decay stable isobars|beta-stable nuclide]], since there is not a difference in binding energy between even–odd and odd–even comparable to that between even–even and odd–odd, leaving other nuclides of the same mass number ([[isobar (nuclide)|isobars]]) free to [[beta decay]] toward the lowest-mass nuclide. An effect of the instability of an odd number of either type of nucleons is that odd-numbered elements, such as the alkali metals, tend to have fewer stable isotopes than even-numbered elements. Of the 26 [[monoisotopic element]]s that have only a single stable isotope, all but one have an odd atomic number and all but one also have an even number of neutrons. [[Beryllium]] is the single exception to both rules, due to its low atomic number.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lide02&quot; /&gt;

[[Caesium-137]], with a half-life of 30.17&amp;nbsp;years, is one of the two principal [[medium-lived fission product]]s, along with [[strontium-90]], which are responsible for most of the [[radioactivity]] of [[spent nuclear fuel]] after several years of cooling, up to several hundred years after use. It constitutes most of the radioactivity still left from the [[Chernobyl accident]]. Caesium-137 undergoes high-energy beta decay and eventually becomes stable [[barium-137]].

== Periodic trends ==
The alkali metals are more similar to each other than the elements in any other [[group (periodic table)|group]] are to each other.&lt;ref name=rsc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemsoc/visualelements/PAGES/data/intro_groupi_data.html |title=Visual Elements: Group 1 – The Alkali Metals |author=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]] |work=Visual Elements |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |accessdate=13 January 2012 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805145647/http://www.rsc.org/chemsoc/visualelements/PAGES/data/intro_groupi_data.html |archivedate=5 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, when moving down the table, all known alkali metals show increasing [[atomic radius]],&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt; decreasing [[electronegativity]],&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt; increasing [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]],&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; and decreasing melting and boiling points&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt; as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot;&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|75}} In general, their [[density|densities]] increase when moving down the table, with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium.&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt;

=== Atomic and ionic radii ===
{{Main|Atomic radius}}
[[File:Effective Nuclear Charge.svg|thumb|250px|[[Effective nuclear charge]] on an atomic electron]]
The atomic radii of the alkali metals increase going down the group.&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt; Because of the [[shielding effect]], when an atom has more than one [[electron shell]], each electron feels electric repulsion from the other electrons as well as electric attraction from the nucleus.&lt;ref name=shielding&gt;{{cite book |first=Theodore |last=L. Brown |first2=H. Eugene |last2=LeMay, Jr. |first3=Bruce E. |last3=Bursten |first4=Julia R. |last4=Burdge |year=2003 |title=Chemistry: The Central Science |edition=8th |publisher=Pearson Education |location=US |isbn=0-13-061142-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the alkali metals, the [[valence electron|outermost electron]] only feels a net charge of +1, as some of the [[nuclear charge]] (which is equal to the [[atomic number]]) is cancelled by the inner electrons; the number of inner electrons of an alkali metal is always one less than the nuclear charge. Therefore, the only factor which affects the atomic radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells. Since this number increases down the group, the atomic radius must also increase down the group.&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt;

The [[ionic radius|ionic radii]] of the alkali metals are much smaller than their atomic radii. This is because the outermost electron of the alkali metals is in a different [[electron shell]] than the inner electrons, and thus when it is removed the resulting atom has one fewer electron shell and is smaller. Additionally, the [[effective nuclear charge]] has increased, and thus the electrons are attracted more strongly towards the nucleus and the ionic radius decreases.&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt;

=== First ionisation energy ===
{{Main|Ionisation energy}}
[[File:First Ionization Energy.svg|thumb|350px|right|Periodic trend for ionisation energy: each period begins at a minimum for the alkali metals, and ends at a maximum for the [[noble gas]]es.]]
The first ionisation energy of an [[chemical element|element]] or [[molecule]] is the energy required to move the most loosely held electron from one [[mole (unit)|mole]] of gaseous atoms of the element or molecules to form one mole of gaseous ions with [[electric charge]] +1. The factors affecting the first ionisation energy are the [[nuclear charge]], the amount of [[shielding effect|shielding]] by the inner electrons and the distance from the most loosely held electron from the nucleus, which is always an outer electron in [[main group element]]s. The first two factors change the effective nuclear charge the most loosely held electron feels. Since the outermost electron of alkali metals always feels the same effective nuclear charge (+1), the only factor which affects the first ionisation energy is the distance from the outermost electron to the nucleus. Since this distance increases down the group, the outermost electron feels less attraction from the nucleus and thus the first ionisation energy decreases.&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt; (This trend is broken in francium due to the [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic]] stabilisation and contraction of the 7s orbital, bringing francium's valence electron closer to the nucleus than would be expected from non-relativistic calculations. This makes francium's outermost electron feel more attraction from the nucleus, increasing its first ionisation energy slightly beyond that of caesium.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|1729}}&lt;!--Also explain why the alkali metals have the lowest ionization energies in their period.--&gt;

The second ionisation energy of the alkali metals is much higher than the first as the second-most loosely held electron is part of a fully filled [[electron shell]] and is thus difficult to remove.&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt;

=== Reactivity ===
{{Main|Reactivity (chemistry)}}
The reactivities of the alkali metals increase going down the group. This is the result of a combination of two factors: the first ionisation energies and [[atomisation energy|atomisation energies]] of the alkali metals. Because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group, it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in [[chemical reaction]]s, thus increasing reactivity down the group. The atomisation energy measures the strength of the [[metallic bond]] of an element, which falls down the group as the atoms increase in [[atomic radius|radius]] and thus the metallic bond must increase in length, making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals. Adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to (but not equal to) the [[activation energy]] of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance. This quantity decreases going down the group, and so does the activation energy; thus, chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;alkaliwater&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group1/reacth2o.html#top |title=Reaction of the Group 1 Elements with Water |last=Clark|first=Jim |year=2005 |work=chemguide |accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electronegativity ===
{{Main|Electronegativity}}
[[File:Periodic variation of Pauling electronegativities.png|thumb|300px|right|The variation of Pauling electronegativity (y-axis) as one descends the [[main group element|main groups]] of the periodic table from the [[period 2 element|second]] to the [[period 6 element|sixth period]]]]
Electronegativity is a [[chemical property]] that describes the tendency of an [[atom]] or a [[functional group]] to attract [[electron]]s (or [[electron density]]) towards itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;{{GoldBookRef|file=E01990|title=Electronegativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the bond between [[sodium]] and [[chlorine]] in [[sodium chloride]] were [[covalent bond|covalent]], the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is +7 in chlorine but is only +1 in sodium. The electron pair is attracted so close to the chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom (an [[ionic bond]]). However, if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom, the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller, making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium. Hence, the larger alkali metal atoms (further down the group) will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them. As mentioned previously, francium is expected to be an exception.&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt;

Because of the higher electronegativity of lithium, some of its compounds have a more covalent character. For example, [[lithium iodide]] ([[lithium|Li]][[iodine|I]]) will dissolve in [[organic solvent]]s, a property of most covalent compounds.&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt; [[Lithium fluoride]] (Li[[fluorine|F]]) is the only [[alkali halide]] that is not soluble in water,&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; and [[lithium hydroxide]] (Li[[hydroxide|OH]]) is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not [[deliquescent]].&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt;

=== Melting and boiling points ===
{{Main|Melting point|Boiling point}}
The melting point of a substance is the point where it changes [[state of matter|state]] from [[solid]] to [[liquid]] while the boiling point of a substance (in liquid state) is the point where the [[vapor pressure|vapour pressure]] of the liquid equals the environmental pressure surrounding the liquid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldberg|first=David E. |title=3,000 Solved Problems in Chemistry|edition=1st|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1988|isbn=0-07-023684-4}} Section 17.43, page 321&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Theodore, Louis |editor2=Dupont, R. Ryan |editor3=Ganesan, Kumar |title=Pollution Prevention: The Waste Management Approach to the 21st Century|publisher=CRC Press|year=1999|isbn=1-56670-495-2|page=15 Section 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all the liquid changes state to [[gas]]. As a metal is heated to its melting point, the [[metallic bond]]s keeping the atoms in place weaken so that the atoms can move around, and the metallic bonds eventually break completely at the metal's boiling point.&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;metallic-bonding&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/atoms/bonding/metallic.html |title=Metallic Bonding |last=Clark|first=Jim |year=2000 |work=chemguide |accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the falling melting and boiling points of the alkali metals indicate that the strength of the metallic bonds of the alkali metals decreases down the group.&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt; This is because metal atoms are held together by the electromagnetic attraction from the positive ions to the delocalised electrons.&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;metallic-bonding&quot; /&gt; As the atoms increase in size going down the group (because their atomic radius increases), the nuclei of the ions move further away from the delocalised electrons and hence the metallic bond becomes weaker so that the metal can more easily melt and boil, thus lowering the melting and boiling points.&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt; (The increased nuclear charge is not a relevant factor due to the shielding effect.)&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt;

=== Density ===
{{Main|Density}}
The alkali metals all have the same [[crystal structure]] ([[body-centered cubic|body-centred cubic]])&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt; and thus the only relevant factors are the number of atoms that can fit into a certain volume and the mass of one of the atoms, since density is defined as mass per unit volume. The first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius, which increases going down the group; thus, the volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group. The mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group. Thus, the trend for the densities of the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii; if figures for these two factors are known, the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated. The resultant trend is that the densities of the alkali metals increase down the table, with an exception at potassium. Due to having the lowest atomic weight of all the elements in their period and having the largest atomic radius for their periods, the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table.&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt; Lithium, sodium, and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water:&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; in fact, lithium is the least dense known solid at [[room temperature]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|75}}

== Compounds ==
The alkali metals form complete series of compounds with all usually encountered anions, which well illustrate group trends. These compounds can be described as involving the alkali metals losing electrons to acceptor species and forming monopositive ions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|79}} This description is most accurate for alkali halides and becomes less and less accurate as cationic and anionic charge increase, and as the anion becomes larger and more polarisable. For instance, [[ionic bond]]ing gives way to [[metallic bond]]ing along the series NaCl, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P, Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;As, Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sb, Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi, Na.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|81}}

=== Hydroxides ===

[[File:Large Sodium Explosion.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A large orange-yellow explosion|A reaction of 3 [[pound (mass)|pounds]] (≈ 1.4 kg) of sodium with water]]
All the alkali metals react vigorously or explosively with cold water, producing an [[aqueous solution]] of a strongly [[base (chemistry)|basic]] alkali metal [[hydroxide]] and releasing hydrogen gas.&lt;ref name=&quot;alkaliwater&quot; /&gt; This reaction becomes more vigorous going down the group: lithium reacts steadily with [[effervescence]], but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers.&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; When an alkali metal is dropped into water, it produces an explosion, of which there are two separate stages. The metal reacts with the water first, breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing [[hydrogen]] gas; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals. Second, the heat generated by the first part of the reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas, causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air. This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water).&lt;ref name=&quot;alkalibangs&quot; /&gt; The alkali metal hydroxides are the most basic known hydroxides.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|87}}

Recent research has suggested that the explosive behavior of alkali metals in water is driven by a [[Coulomb explosion]] rather than solely by rapid generation of hydrogen itself.&lt;ref name=coulomb&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nchem.2161.html|title=Coulomb explosion during the early stages of the reaction of alkali metals with water|work=Nature Chemistry|doi=10.1038/nchem.2161|date=26 Jan 2015|volume=7|pages=250–254|bibcode=2015NatCh...7..250M}}&lt;/ref&gt; All alkali metals melt as a part of the reaction with water. Water molecules ionise the bare metallic surface of the liquid metal, leaving a positively charged metal surface and negatively charged water ions. The attraction between the charged metal and water ions will rapidly increase the surface area, causing an exponential increase of ionisation. When the repulsive forces within the liquid metal surface exceeds the forces of the surface tension, it vigorously explodes.&lt;ref name=coulomb /&gt;

The hydroxides themselves are the most basic hydroxides known, reacting with acids to give salts and with alcohols to give [[oligomer]]ic [[alkoxide]]s. They easily react with [[carbon dioxide]] to form [[carbonate]]s or [[bicarbonate]]s, or with [[hydrogen sulfide]] to form [[sulfide]]s or [[bisulfide]]s, and may be used to separate [[thiol]]s from petroleum. They react with amphoteric oxides: for example, the oxides of [[aluminium]], [[zinc]], [[tin]], and [[lead]] react with the alkali metal hydroxides to give aluminates, zincates, stannates, and plumbates. [[Silicon dioxide]] is acidic, and thus the alkali metal hydroxides can also attack [[silicate glass]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|87}}

=== Intermetallic compounds ===
[[File:NaK alloy.jpg|thumb|right|Liquid NaK alloy at room temperature]]
The alkali metals form many [[intermetallic compound]]s with each other and the elements from groups [[alkaline earth metal|2]] to [[boron group|13]] in the periodic table of varying stoichiometries,&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|81}} such as the [[sodium amalgam]]s with [[mercury (element)|mercury]], including Na&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Hg&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Hg.&lt;ref&gt;Buszek, Keith R.

=== Compounds with the group 13 elements ===
The intermetallic compounds of the alkali metals with the heavier group 13 elements ([[aluminium]], [[gallium]], [[indium]], and [[thallium]]), such as NaTl, are poor [[Electrical conductor|conductors]] or [[semiconductor]]s, unlike the normal alloys with the preceding elements, implying that the alkali metal involved has lost an electron to the [[Zintl phase|Zintl anions]] involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sevov&quot;&gt;Sevov, S.C. [http://www3.nd.edu/~sevovlab/articles/SlaviChapter.pdf &quot;Zintl Phases&quot;], pp. 113–132 in ''Intermetallic Compounds, Principles and Practice: Progress'', Vol. 3. Westbrook, J.H.; Freisher, R.L.: Eds.; John Wiley &amp; Sons. Ltd., Chichester, England {{DOI|10.1002/0470845856}} {{ISBN|978-0-470-84585-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, while the elements in group 14 and beyond tend to form discrete anionic clusters, group 13 elements tend to form polymeric ions with the alkali metal cations located between the giant ionic lattice. For example, NaTl consists of a polymeric anion (—Tl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;—)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; with a covalent [[diamond cubic]] structure with Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions located between the anionic lattice. The larger alkali metals cannot fit similarly into an anionic lattice and tend to force the heavier group 13 elements to form anionic clusters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kauzlarich&quot;&gt;S.M. Kauzlarich, Encyclopedia of Inorganic chemistry, 1994, John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|0-471-93620-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boron]] is a special case, being the only nonmetal in group 13. The alkali metal [[boride]]s tend to be boron-rich, involving appreciable boron–boron bonding involving [[deltahedron|deltahedral]] structures,&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|147–8}} and are thermally unstable due to the alkali metals having a very high [[vapour pressure]] at elevated temperatures. This makes direct synthesis problematic because the alkali metals do not react with boron below 700&amp;nbsp;°C, and thus this must be accomplished in sealed containers with the alkali metal in excess. Furthermore, exceptionally in this group, reactivity with boron decreases down the group: lithium reacts completely at 700&amp;nbsp;°C, but sodium at 900&amp;nbsp;°C and potassium not until 1200&amp;nbsp;°C, and the reaction is instantaneous for lithium but takes hours for potassium. Rubidium and caesium borides have not even been characterised. Various phases are known, such as LiB&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, NaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, NaB&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;, and KB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hagen |first=A.

Lithium, the lightest of the alkali metals, is the only alkali metal which reacts with [[nitrogen]] at [[standard conditions]], and its [[nitride]] is the only stable alkali metal nitride. Nitrogen is an [[reactivity (chemistry)|unreactive]] gas because breaking the strong [[triple bond]] in the [[dinitrogen]] molecule (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) requires a lot of energy. The formation of an alkali metal nitride would consume the ionisation energy of the alkali metal (forming M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions), the energy required to break the triple bond in N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the formation of N&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; ions, and all the energy released from the formation of an alkali metal nitride is from the [[lattice energy]] of the alkali metal nitride. The lattice energy is maximised with small, highly charged ions; the alkali metals do not form highly charged ions, only forming ions with a charge of +1, so only lithium, the smallest alkali metal, can release enough lattice energy to make the reaction with nitrogen [[exothermic]], forming [[lithium nitride]]. The reactions of the other alkali metals with nitrogen would not release enough lattice energy and would thus be [[endothermic]], so they do not form nitrides at standard conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;alkalireact&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group1/reacto2.html#top |title=Reaction of the Group 1 Elements with Oxygen and Chlorine |last=Clark|first=Jim |year=2005 |work=chemguide |accessdate=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sodium nitride]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N) and [[potassium nitride]] (K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N), while existing, are extremely unstable, being prone to decomposing back into their constituent elements, and cannot be produced by reacting the elements with each other at standard conditions.&lt;ref name=Jansen1&gt;{{cite journal |title=Synthesis and structure of Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N|last=Fischer|first=D. |last2=Jansen|first2=M.|journal= Angew Chem|volume=41|issue=10|pages=1755–1756|year=2002|doi=10.1002/1521-3773(20020517)41:10&lt;1755::AID-ANIE1755&gt;3.0.CO;2-C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jansen2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Synthesis and structure of K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N|last1=Fischer|first1=D. |last2=Cancarevic|first2=Z. |last3=Schön|first3=J.

All the alkali metals react vigorously with [[oxygen]] at standard conditions. They form various types of oxides, such as simple [[oxide]]s (containing the O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ion), [[peroxide]]s (containing the {{chem|O|2|2-}} ion, where there is a [[single bond]] between the two oxygen atoms), [[superoxide]]s (containing the {{chem|O|2|-}} ion), and many others. Lithium burns in air to form [[lithium oxide]], but sodium reacts with oxygen to form a mixture of [[sodium oxide]] and [[sodium peroxide]]. Potassium forms a mixture of [[potassium peroxide]] and [[potassium superoxide]], while rubidium and caesium form the superoxide exclusively. Their reactivity increases going down the group: while lithium, sodium and potassium merely burn in air, rubidium and caesium are [[pyrophoric]] (spontaneously catch fire in air).&lt;ref name=&quot;alkalireact&quot; /&gt;

The smaller alkali metals tend to polarise the larger anions (the peroxide and superoxide) due to their small size. This attracts the electrons in the more complex anions towards one of its constituent oxygen atoms, forming an oxide ion and an oxygen atom. This causes lithium to form the oxide exclusively on reaction with oxygen at room temperature. This effect becomes drastically weaker for the larger sodium and potassium, allowing them to form the less stable peroxides. Rubidium and caesium, at the bottom of the group, are so large that even the least stable superoxides can form. Because the superoxide releases the most energy when formed, the superoxide is preferentially formed for the larger alkali metals where the more complex anions are not polarised. (The oxides and peroxides for these alkali metals do exist, but do not form upon direct reaction of the metal with oxygen at standard conditions.)&lt;ref name=&quot;alkalireact&quot; /&gt; In addition, the small size of the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ions contributes to their forming a stable ionic lattice structure. Under controlled conditions, however, all the alkali metals, with the exception of francium, are known to form their oxides, peroxides, and superoxides. The alkali metal peroxides and superoxides are powerful [[oxidising agent]]s. [[Sodium peroxide]] and [[potassium superoxide]] react with [[carbon dioxide]] to form the alkali metal carbonate and oxygen gas, which allows them to be used in [[submarine]] air purifiers; the presence of [[water vapour]], naturally present in breath, makes the removal of carbon dioxide by potassium superoxide even more efficient.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lindsay |first1=D.

The alkali metals can also react analogously with the heavier chalcogens ([[sulfur]], [[selenium]], [[tellurium]], and [[polonium]]), and all the alkali metal chalcogenides are known (with the exception of francium's). Reaction with an excess of the chalcogen can similarly result in lower chalcogenides, with chalcogen ions containing chains of the chalcogen atoms in question. For example, sodium can react with sulfur to form the [[sulfide]] ([[sodium sulfide|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]]) and various [[polysulfide]]s with the formula Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; (''x'' from 2 to 6), containing the {{chem|S|''x''|2-}} ions.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry /&gt; Due to the basicity of the Se&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; and Te&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ions, the alkali metal [[selenide]]s and [[telluride (chemistry)|tellurides]] are alkaline in solution; when reacted directly with selenium and tellurium, alkali metal polyselenides and polytellurides are formed along with the selenides and tellurides with the {{chem|Se|''x''|2-}} and {{chem|Te|''x''|2-}} ions.&lt;ref name=&quot;house2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Inorganic chemistry |first= James E.|last= House |publisher= Academic Press |year= 2008 |isbn= 0-12-356786-6 |page= 524}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be obtained directly from the elements in liquid ammonia or when air is not present, and are colourless, water-soluble compounds that air oxidises quickly back to selenium or tellurium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|766}} The alkali metal [[polonide]]s are all ionic compounds containing the Po&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ion; they are very chemically stable and can be produced by direct reaction of the elements at around 300–400&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|766}}&lt;ref name=&quot;AEC-chem&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Moyer |first= Harvey V. |contribution= Chemical Properties of Polonium |pages= 33–96 |title= Polonium |url= http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/4367751-nEJIbm/ |editor-last= Moyer |editor-first= Harvey V. |id= TID-5221 |doi= 10.2172/4367751 |year= 1956 |location= Oak Ridge, Tenn. |publisher= United States Atomic Energy Commission |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bagnall&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first= K.

=== Halides, hydrides, and pseudohalides ===
{{Main|Alkali metal halide}}
The alkali metals are among the most [[electropositive]] elements on the periodic table and thus tend to [[ionic bond|bond ionically]] to the most [[electronegative]] elements on the periodic table, the [[halogen]]s ([[fluorine]], [[chlorine]], [[bromine]], [[iodine]], and [[astatine]]), forming [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] known as the alkali metal halides. The reaction is very vigorous and can sometimes result in explosions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|76}} All twenty stable alkali metal halides are known; the unstable ones are not known, with the exception of sodium astatide, because of the great instability and rarity of astatine and francium. The most well-known of the twenty is certainly [[sodium chloride]], otherwise known as common salt. All of the stable alkali metal halides have the formula MX where M is an alkali metal and X is a halogen. They are all white ionic crystalline solids that have high melting points.&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alkalireact&quot; /&gt; All the alkali metal halides are [[solubility|soluble]] in water except for [[lithium fluoride]] (LiF), which is insoluble in water due to its very high [[lattice enthalpy]]. The high lattice enthalpy of lithium fluoride is due to the small sizes of the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions, causing the [[electrostatic interaction]]s between them to be strong:&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; a similar effect occurs for [[magnesium fluoride]], consistent with the diagonal relationship between lithium and magnesium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|76}}

The alkali metals also react similarly with hydrogen to form ionic alkali metal hydrides, where the [[hydride]] anion acts as a [[pseudohalogen|pseudohalide]]: these are often used as reducing agents, producing hydrides, complex metal hydrides, or hydrogen gas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|83}}&lt;ref name=&quot;generalchemistry&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Averill |first1=Bruce A. |last2=Eldredge |first2=Patricia |title=Chemistry: Principles, Patterns, and Applications with Student Access Kit for Mastering General Chemistry |url=http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/general-chemistry-principles-patterns-and-applications-v1.0/section_25_03.html |accessdate=24 June 2013 |year=2007 |publisher=Prentice Hall |edition=1st |isbn=978-0-8053-3799-0 |chapter=21.3: The Alkali Metals}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other pseudohalides are also known, notably the [[cyanide]]s. These are isostructural to the respective halides except for [[lithium cyanide]], indicating that the cyanide ions may rotate freely.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|322}} Ternary alkali metal halide oxides, such as Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ClO, K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BrO (yellow), Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, are also known.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|83}} The polyhalides are rather unstable, although those of rubidium and caesium are greatly stabilised by the feeble polarising power of these extremely large cations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|835}}

Alkali metal cations do not usually form [[coordination complex]]es with simple [[Lewis base]]s due to their low charge of just +1 and their relatively large size; thus the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion forms most complexes and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less (though exceptions occur for weak complexes).&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|90}} Lithium in particular has a very rich coordination chemistry in which it exhibits [[coordination number]]s from 1 to 12, although octahedral hexacoordination is its preferred mode.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|90–1}} In [[aqueous solution]], the alkali metal ions exist as octahedral hexahydrate complexes ([M(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), with the exception of the lithium ion, which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes ([Li(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;); the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of attraction to the polar water molecules. Because of this, [[anhydrous]] salts containing alkali metal cations are often used as [[desiccant]]s.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry /&gt; Alkali metals also readily form complexes with [[crown ether]]s (e.g. [[12-crown-4]] for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[15-crown-5]] for Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[18-crown-6]] for K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and [[21-crown-7]] for Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[cryptand]]s due to electrostatic attraction.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry /&gt;

=== Ammonia solutions ===
The alkali metals dissolve slowly in liquid [[ammonia]], forming ammoniacal solutions of solvated M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, which react to form hydrogen gas and the [[metal amide#Alkali metal amides|alkali metal amide]] (MNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where M represents an alkali metal): this was first noted by [[Humphry Davy]] in 1809 and rediscovered by W. Weyl in 1864. The process may be speeded up by a [[catalyst]]. Similar solutions are formed by the heavy divalent [[alkaline earth metal]]s [[calcium]], [[strontium]], [[barium]], as well as the divalent [[lanthanide]]s, [[europium]] and [[ytterbium]]. The amide salt is quite insoluble and readily precipitates out of solution, leaving intensely coloured ammonia solutions of the alkali metals. In 1907, Charles Krause&lt;!--don't link; the one being referred to has no article on WP yet--&gt; identified the colour as being due to the presence of [[solvated electron]]s, which contribute to the high electrical conductivity of these solutions. At low concentrations (below 3 M), the solution is dark blue and has ten times the conductivity of aqueous [[sodium chloride]]; at higher concentrations (above 3 M), the solution is copper-coloured and has approximately the conductivity of liquid metals like [[mercury (element)|mercury]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=generalchemistry /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;c&amp;w&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Cotton |first=F. A. |first2=G.|last2=Wilkinson |title=Advanced Inorganic Chemistry |year=1972 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons Inc |isbn=0-471-17560-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the alkali metal amide salt and solvated electrons, such ammonia solutions also contain the alkali metal cation (M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), the neutral alkali metal atom (M), [[diatomic molecule|diatomic]] alkali metal molecules (M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and alkali metal anions (M&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). These are unstable and eventually become the more thermodynamically stable alkali metal amide and hydrogen gas. Solvated electrons are powerful [[reducing agent]]s and are often used in chemical synthesis.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry /&gt;

Being the smallest alkali metal, lithium forms the widest variety of and most stable [[organometallic compound]]s, which are bonded covalently. [[Organolithium reagent|Organolithium]] compounds are electrically non-conducting volatile solids or liquids that melt at low temperatures, and tend to form [[oligomer]]s with the structure (RLi)&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; where R is the organic group. As the electropositive nature of lithium puts most of the [[charge density]] of the bond on the carbon atom, effectively creating a [[carbanion]], organolithium compounds are extremely powerful [[base (chemistry)|bases]] and [[carbon nucleophile|nucleophiles]]. For use as bases, [[butyllithium]]s are often used and are commercially available. An example of an organolithium compound is [[methyllithium]] ((CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Li)&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;), which exists in tetrameric (''x'' = 4, tetrahedral) and hexameric (''x'' = 6, octahedral) forms.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown1957&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown|first1=T.

Alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may also react with ''N'',''N''-disubstituted [[amide]]s to give aldehydes and ketones, and symmetrical ketones by reacting with [[carbon monoxide]]. They thermally decompose to eliminate a β-hydrogen, producing [[alkene]]s and [[lithium hydride]]: another route is the reaction of [[ether]]s with alkyl- and aryllithiums that act as strong bases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|105}} In non-polar solvents, aryllithiums react as the carbanions they effectively are, turning carbon dioxide to aromatic [[carboxylic acid]]s (ArCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H) and aryl ketones to tertiary carbinols (Ar'&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(Ar)OH). Finally, they may be used to synthesise other organometallic compounds through metal-halogen exchange.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|106}}

==== Heavier alkali metals ====
Unlike the organolithium compounds, the organometallic compounds of the heavier alkali metals are predominantly ionic. The application of [[organosodium chemistry|organosodium]] compounds in chemistry is limited in part due to competition from [[organolithium compound]]s, which are commercially available and exhibit more convenient reactivity. The principal organosodium compound of commercial importance is [[sodium cyclopentadienide]]. [[Sodium tetraphenylborate]] can also be classified as an organosodium compound since in the solid state sodium is bound to the aryl groups. Organometallic compounds of the higher alkali metals are even more reactive than organosodium compounds and of limited utility. A notable reagent is [[Schlosser's base]], a mixture of [[n-Butyllithium|''n''-butyllithium]] and [[potassium tert-butoxide|potassium ''tert''-butoxide]]. This reagent reacts with [[propene]] to form the compound [[allylpotassium]] (KCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). [[cis-2-butene|''cis''-2-Butene]] and [[trans-2-butene|''trans''-2-butene]] equilibrate when in contact with alkali metals. Whereas [[isomerisation]] is fast with lithium and sodium, it is slow with the heavier alkali metals. The heavier alkali metals also favour the [[steric hindrance|sterically]] congested conformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Superbases for organic synthesis |last=Schlosser|first=Manfred|journal= Pure and Appl. Chem. |volume= 60 |issue= 11 |pages= 1627–1634 |year= 1988 |doi= 10.1351/pac198860111627}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several crystal structures of organopotassium compounds have been reported, establishing that they, like the sodium compounds, are polymeric.&lt;ref name=Klett&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ejic.201000983|title=Synthesis and Structures of \(Trimethylsilyl)methyl]sodium and -potassium with Bi- and Tridentate N-Donor Ligands|year=2011|last1=Clegg|first1=William|last2=Conway|first2=Ben|last3=Kennedy|first3=Alan R.|last4=Klett|first4=Jan|last5=Mulvey|first5=Robert E.|last6=Russo|first6=Luca|journal=European Journal of Inorganic Chemistry|volume=2011|issue=5|pages=721–726|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/210286264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organosodium, organopotassium, organorubidium and organocaesium compounds are all mostly ionic and are insoluble (or nearly so) in nonpolar solvents.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry /&gt;

Alkyl and aryl derivatives of sodium and potassium tend to react with air. They cause the cleavage of [[ether]]s, generating alkoxides. Unlike alkyllithium compounds, alkylsodiums and alkylpotassiums cannot be made by reacting the metals with alkyl halides because [[Wurtz coupling]] occurs:&lt;ref name=King /&gt;{{rp|265}}
:RM + R'X → R–R' + MX

As such, they have to be made by reacting [[organomercury compound|alkylmercury]] compounds with sodium or potassium metal in inert hydrocarbon solvents. While methylsodium forms tetramers like methyllithium, methylpotassium is more ionic and has the [[nickel arsenide]] structure with discrete methyl anions and potassium cations.&lt;ref name=King /&gt;{{rp|265}}

The alkali metals and their hydrides react with acidic hydrocarbons, for example [[cyclopentadiene]]s and terminal alkynes, to give salts. Liquid ammonia, ether, or hydrocarbon solvents are used, the most common of which being [[tetrahydrofuran]]. The most important of these compounds is [[sodium cyclopentadienide]], NaC&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, an important precursor to many transition metal cyclopentadienyl derivatives.&lt;ref name=King /&gt;{{rp|265}} Similarly, the alkali metals react with [[cyclooctatetraene]] in tetrahydrofuran to give alkali metal [[cyclooctatetraenide]]s; for example, [[dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide]] (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) is an important precursor to many metal cyclooctatetraenyl derivatives, such as [[uranocene]].&lt;ref name=King /&gt;{{rp|266}} The large and very weakly polarising alkali metal cations can stabilise large, aromatic, polarisable radical anions, such as the dark-green [[sodium naphthalenide]], Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;•]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, a strong reducing agent.&lt;ref name=King /&gt;{{rp|266}}

Although francium is the heaviest alkali metal that has been discovered, there has been some theoretical work predicting the physical and chemical characteristics of the hypothetical heavier alkali metals. Being the first [[period 8 element]], the undiscovered element [[ununennium]] (element 119) is predicted to be the next alkali metal after francium and behave much like their lighter [[Congener (chemistry)|congeners]]; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot; /&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} Its chemistry is predicted to be closer to that of potassium&lt;ref name=EB /&gt; or rubidium&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot; /&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} instead of caesium or francium. This is unusual as [[periodic trends]], ignoring relativistic effects would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium. This lowered [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]] is due to the relativistic stabilisation of ununennium's valence electron, increasing ununennium's first ionisation energy and decreasing the [[metallic radius|metallic]] and [[ionic radius|ionic radii]];&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot; /&gt; this effect is already seen for francium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot; /&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} This assumes that ununennium will behave chemically as an alkali metal, which, although likely, may not be true due to relativistic effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;tanm&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lch.web.psi.ch/files/lectures/TexasA&amp;M/TexasA&amp;M.pdf |title=Gas Phase Chemistry of Superheavy Elements |last=Gäggeler |first=Heinz W. |date=5–7 November 2007 |work=Lecture Course Texas A&amp;M |accessdate=26 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220090755/http://lch.web.psi.ch/files/lectures/TexasA%26M/TexasA%26M.pdf |archivedate=20 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relativistic stabilisation of the 8s orbital also increases ununennium's [[electron affinity]] far beyond that of caesium and francium; indeed, ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it.

The stabilisation of ununennium's valence electron and thus the contraction of the 8s orbital cause its atomic radius to be lowered to 240&amp;nbsp;[[picometer|pm]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot; /&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} very close to that of rubidium (247&amp;nbsp;pm),&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; so that the chemistry of ununennium in the +1 oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of rubidium than to that of francium.

Not as much work has been done predicting the properties of the alkali metals beyond ununennium.

Hence it can lose an electron to form the [[hydron (chemistry)|hydron]] H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, or gain one to form the [[hydride]] ion H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|43}} In the former case it resembles superficially the alkali metals; in the latter case, the halogens, but the differences due to the lack of a 1p subshell are important enough that neither group fits the properties of hydrogen well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|43}} Group 14 is also a good fit in terms of thermodynamic properties such as [[ionisation energy]] and [[electron affinity]], but makes chemical nonsense because hydrogen cannot be tetravalent. Thus none of the three placements are entirely satisfactory, although group 1 is the most common placement (if one is chosen) because the hydron is by far the most important of all monatomic hydrogen species, being the foundation of acid-base chemistry.&lt;ref name=hydrogen /&gt; As an example of hydrogen's unorthodox properties stemming from its unusual electron configuration and small size, the hydrogen ion is very small (radius around 150&amp;nbsp;[[femtometre|fm]] compared to the 50–220&amp;nbsp;pm size of most other atoms and ions) and so is nonexistent in condensed systems other than in association with other atoms or molecules. Indeed, transferring of protons between chemicals is the basis of [[acid-base chemistry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|43}} Also unique is hydrogen's ability to form [[hydrogen bond]]s, which are an effect of charge-transfer, [[electrostatic]], and electron correlative contributing phenomena.&lt;ref name=hydrogen /&gt; While analogous lithium bonds are also known, they are mostly electrostatic.&lt;ref name=hydrogen /&gt; Nevertheless, hydrogen can take on the same structural role as the alkali metals in some molecular crystals, and has a close relationship with the lightest alkali metals (especially lithium).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cousins |first=David M. |last2=Davidson |first2=Matthew G. |last3=García-Vivó |first3=Daniel |date=2013 |title=Unprecedented participation of a four-coordinate hydrogen atom in the cubane core of lithium and sodium phenolates |url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2013/cc/c3cc47393g |journal=Chem.

Other &quot;pseudo-alkali metals&quot; include the [[alkylammonium]] cations, in which some of the hydrogen atoms in the ammonium cation are replaced by alkyl or aryl groups. In particular, the [[quaternary ammonium cation]]s ({{chem|NR|4|+}}) are very useful since they are permanently charged, and they are often used as an alternative to the expensive Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to stabilise very large and very easily polarisable anions such as {{chem|HI|2|-}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|812–9}} Tetraalkylammonium hydroxides, like alkali metal hydroxides, are very strong bases that react with atmospheric carbon dioxide to form carbonates.&lt;ref name=King /&gt;{{rp|256}} Furthermore, the nitrogen atom may be replaced by a phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony atom (the heavier nonmetallic [[pnictogen]]s), creating a [[phosphonium]] ({{chem|PH|4|+}}) or [[arsonium]] ({{chem|AsH|4|+}}) cation that can itself be substituted similarly; while [[stibonium]] ({{chem|SbH|4|+}}) itself is not known, some of its organic derivatives are characterised.&lt;ref name=pseudo /&gt;

=== Cobaltocene and derivatives ===
[[Cobaltocene]], Co(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is a [[metallocene]], the [[cobalt]] analogue of [[ferrocene]]. It is a dark purple solid. Cobaltocene has 19 valence electrons, one more than usually found in organotransition metal complexes, such as its very stable relative, ferrocene, in accordance with the [[18-electron rule]]. This additional electron occupies an orbital that is antibonding with respect to the Co–C bonds. Consequently, many chemical reactions of Co(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are characterized by its tendency to lose this &quot;extra&quot; electron, yielding a very stable 18-electron cation known as cobaltocenium. Many cobaltocenium salts coprecipitate with caesium salts, and cobaltocenium hydroxide is a strong base that absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide to form cobaltocenium carbonate.&lt;ref name=King /&gt;{{rp|256}} Like the alkali metals, cobaltocene is a strong reducing agent, and [[decamethylcobaltocene]] is stronger still due to the combined [[inductive effect]] of the ten methyl groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/cr940053x|pmid=11848774|title=Chemical Redox Agents for Organometallic Chemistry|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=96|issue=2|pages=877–910|year=1996|last1=Connelly|first1=Neil G.|last2=Geiger|first2=William E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cobalt may be substituted by its heavier congener [[rhodium]] to give [[rhodocene]], an even stronger reducing agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= El Murr |first1= N. |last2= Sheats |first2= J.

=== Thallium ===

[[Thallium]] is the heaviest stable element in group 13 of the periodic table. At the bottom of the periodic table, the [[inert pair effect]] is quite strong, because of the [[relativistic effects|relativistic]] stabilisation of the 6s orbital and the decreasing bond energy as the atoms increase in size so that the amount of energy released in forming two more bonds is not worth the high ionisation energies of the 6s electrons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|226–7}} It displays the +1 [[oxidation state]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|28}} that all the known alkali metals display,&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|28}} and thallium compounds with thallium in its +1 [[oxidation state]] closely resemble the corresponding potassium or [[silver]] compounds stoichiometrically due to the similar ionic radii of the Tl&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (164&amp;nbsp;[[picometer|pm]]), K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (152&amp;nbsp;pm) and Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (129&amp;nbsp;pm) ions.&lt;ref name=Shannon&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1107/S0567739476001551|title=Revised effective ionic radii and systematic studies of interatomic distances in halides and chalcogenides|last=Shannon|first=R.

The [[group 11 element|group 11 metals]] (or coinage metals), [[copper]], [[silver]], and [[gold]], are typically categorised as transition metals given they can form ions with incomplete d-shells. Physically, they have the relatively low melting points and high electronegativity values associated with [[post-transition metal]]s. &quot;The filled ''d'' subshell and free ''s'' electron of Cu, Ag, and Au contribute to their high electrical and thermal conductivity. Transition metals to the left of group 11 experience interactions between ''s'' electrons and the partially filled ''d'' subshell that lower electron mobility.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Russell AM &amp; Lee KL (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=fIu58uZTE-gC ''Structure-property relations in nonferrous metals'']. Wiley-Interscience, New York. p.&amp;nbsp;302. {{ISBN|0-471-64952-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemically, the group 11 metals behave like main-group metals in their +1 valence states, and are hence somewhat related to the alkali metals: this is one reason for their previously being labelled as &quot;group IB&quot;, paralleling the alkali metals' &quot;group IA&quot;. They are occasionally classified as post-transition metals.&lt;ref&gt;Deming HG (1940) ''Fundamental Chemistry,'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, pp.&amp;nbsp;705–7&lt;/ref&gt; Their spectra are analogous to those of the alkali metals.&lt;ref name=Jensen /&gt; Their monopositive ions are [[paramagnetic]] and contribute no colour to their salts, like those of the alkali metals.&lt;ref&gt;Bailar, J. C. (1973) ''Comprehensive inorganic chemistry'', vol. 3, p. 16. {{ISBN|1-57215-291-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mendeleev's 1871 periodic table, copper, silver, and gold are listed twice, once under group VIII (with the [[iron triad]] and [[platinum group metal]]s), and once under group IB. Group IB was nonetheless parenthesised to note that it was tentative. Mendeleev's main criterion for group assignment was the maximum oxidation state of an element: on that basis, the group 11 elements could not be classified in group IB, due to the existence of copper(II) and gold(III) compounds being known at that time.&lt;ref name=Jensen /&gt; However, eliminating group IB would make group I the only main group (group VIII was labelled a transition group) to lack an A–B bifurcation.&lt;ref name=Jensen /&gt; Soon afterward, a majority of chemists chose to classify these elements in group IB and remove them from group VIII for the resulting symmetry: this was the predominant classification until the rise of the modern medium-long 18-column periodic table, which separated the alkali metals and group 11 metals.&lt;ref name=Jensen /&gt;

The coinage metals were traditionally regarded as a subdivision of the alkali metal group, due to them sharing the characteristic s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; electron configuration of the alkali metals (group 1: p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; group 11: d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;). However, the similarities are largely confined to the [[stochiometry|stoichiometries]] of the +1 compounds of both groups, and not their chemical properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|1177}} This stems from the filled d subshell providing a much weaker shielding effect on the outermost s electron than the filled p subshell, so that the coinage metals have much higher first ionisation energies and smaller ionic radii than do the corresponding alkali metals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|1177}} Furthermore, they have higher melting points, hardnesses, and densities, and lower reactivities and solubilities in liquid [[ammonia]], as well as having more covalent character in their compounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|1177}} Finally, the alkali metals are at the top of the [[electrochemical series]], whereas the coinage metals are almost at the very bottom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|1177}} The coinage metals' filled d shell is much more easily disrupted than the alkali metals' filled p shell, so that the second and third ionisation energies are lower, enabling higher oxidation states than +1 and a richer coordination chemistry, thus giving the group 11 metals clear [[transition metal]] character.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|1177}} Particularly noteworthy is gold forming ionic compounds with rubidium and caesium, in which it forms the auride ion (Au&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) which also occurs in solvated form in liquid ammonia solution: here gold behaves as a [[pseudohalogen]] because its 5d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;6s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; configuration has one electron less than the quasi-closed shell 5d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;6s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; configuration of [[mercury (element)|mercury]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|1177}}

=== In the Solar System ===
[[File:SolarSystemAbundances.png|thumb|right|800px|Estimated abundances of the chemical elements in the Solar system. Hydrogen and helium are most common, from the [[Big Bang]]. The next three elements (lithium, [[beryllium]], and [[boron]]) are rare because they are poorly synthesised in the Big Bang and also in stars. The two general trends in the remaining stellar-produced elements are: (1) an alternation of abundance in elements as they have even or odd atomic numbers, and (2) a general decrease in abundance, as elements become heavier. Iron is especially common because it represents the minimum energy nuclide that can be made by fusion of helium in supernovae.&lt;ref name=lodders&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lodders |first1= Katharina |year= 2003 |title= Solar System Abundances and Condensation Temperatures of the Elements |journal= The Astrophysical Journal |volume= 591 |issue= 2 |pages= 1220–1247 |bibcode= 2003ApJ...591.1220L |doi= 10.1086/375492|doi-access= free }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Oddo–Harkins rule]] holds that elements with even atomic numbers are more common that those with odd atomic numbers, with the exception of hydrogen. This rule argues that elements with odd atomic numbers have one unpaired proton and are more likely to capture another, thus increasing their atomic number. In elements with even atomic numbers, protons are paired, with each member of the pair offsetting the spin of the other, enhancing stability.&lt;ref name=oddo&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1002/zaac.19140870118 |title= Die Molekularstruktur der radioaktiven Atome |year= 1914 |last1= Oddo |first1= Giuseppe |journal= Zeitschrift für anorganische Chemie |volume= 87 |pages= 253–268|url= https://www.academia.edu/11043300 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harkins&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1021/ja02250a002 |year= 1917 |last1= Harkins |first1= William D. |journal= Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume= 39 |issue= 5 |pages= 856–879 |title= The Evolution of the Elements and the Stability of Complex Atoms.

The heavier alkali metals are also less abundant than the lighter ones as the alkali metals from rubidium onward can only be synthesised in [[supernova]]e and not in [[stellar nucleosynthesis]]. Lithium is also much less abundant than sodium and potassium as it is poorly synthesised in both [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] and in stars: the Big Bang could only produce trace quantities of lithium, [[beryllium]] and [[boron]] due to the absence of a stable nucleus with 5 or 8 [[nucleon]]s, and stellar nucleosynthesis could only pass this bottleneck by the [[triple-alpha process]], fusing three helium nuclei to form [[carbon]], and skipping over those three elements.&lt;ref name=lodders /&gt;

The [[Earth]] formed from the same cloud of matter that formed the Sun, but the planets acquired different compositions during the [[formation and evolution of the solar system]]. In turn, the [[history of Earth|natural history of the Earth]] caused parts of this planet to have differing concentrations of the elements. The mass of the Earth is approximately 5.98{{e|24}}&amp;nbsp;kg. It is composed mostly of [[iron]] (32.1%), [[oxygen]] (30.1%), [[silicon]] (15.1%), [[magnesium]] (13.9%), [[sulfur]] (2.9%), [[nickel]] (1.8%), [[calcium]] (1.5%), and [[aluminium]] (1.4%); with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to [[planetary differentiation]], the core region is believed to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.&lt;ref name=pnas71_12_6973&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morgan|first1=J.

The alkali metals, due to their high reactivity, do not occur naturally in pure form in nature.

The production of pure alkali metals is somewhat complicated due to their extreme reactivity with commonly used substances, such as water.&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt;&lt;ref name=generalchemistry /&gt; From their [[silicate]] ores, all the stable alkali metals may be obtained the same way: [[sulfuric acid]] is first used to dissolve the desired alkali metal ion and [[aluminium]](III) ions from the ore (leaching), whereupon basic precipitation removes aluminium ions from the mixture by precipitating it as the [[aluminium hydroxide|hydroxide]]. The remaining insoluble alkali metal [[carbonate]] is then precipitated selectively; the salt is then dissolved in [[hydrochloric acid]] to produce the chloride. The result is then left to evaporate and the alkali metal can then be isolated.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry /&gt; Lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid chlorides, with [[calcium chloride]] typically added to lower the melting point of the mixture. The heavier alkali metals, however, is more typically isolated in a different way, where a reducing agent (typically sodium for potassium and [[magnesium]] or [[calcium]] for the heaviest alkali metals) is used to reduce the alkali metal chloride. The liquid or gaseous product (the alkali metal) then undergoes [[fractional distillation]] for purification.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry /&gt;

Lithium salts have to be extracted from the water of [[mineral spring]]s, [[brine]] pools, and brine deposits. The metal is produced electrolytically from a mixture of fused [[lithium chloride]] and [[potassium chloride]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ober&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/lithium/450798.pdf |title=Lithium|accessdate= 19 August 2007|last=Ober |first=Joyce A. |format=PDF |pages= 77–78 |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070711062102/http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/lithium/450798.pdf |archivedate= 11 July 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although sodium is less reactive than potassium, this process works because at such high temperatures potassium is more volatile than sodium and can easily be distilled off, so that the equilibrium shifts towards the right to produce more potassium gas and proceeds almost to completion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot; /&gt;{{rp|74}}

== Biological role and precautions ==

=== Metals ===
Pure alkali metals are dangerously reactive with air and water and must be kept away from heat, fire, oxidising agents, acids, most organic compounds, [[halocarbon]]s, [[plastic]]s, and moisture. They also react with carbon dioxide and carbon tetrachloride, so that normal fire extinguishers are counterproductive when used on alkali metal fires.&lt;ref name=osu /&gt; Some Class D dry powder [[fire extinguisher|extinguishers]] designed for metal fires are effective, depriving the fire of oxygen and cooling the alkali metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2fHsoobsCNwC&amp;pg=PA459|page= 459 |title= Fire and Life Safety Inspection Manual |isbn= 978-0-87765-472-8|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |last= Solomon |first=Robert E. |date= 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments are usually conducted using only small quantities of a few grams in a [[fume hood]].

[[Radioisotope]]s of caesium require special precautions: the improper handling of caesium-137 [[gamma ray]] sources can lead to release of this radioisotope and radiation injuries. Perhaps the best-known case is the Goiânia accident of 1987, in which an improperly-disposed-of radiation therapy system from an abandoned clinic in the city of [[Goiânia]], [[Brazil]], was scavenged from a junkyard, and the glowing [[caesium chloride|caesium salt]] sold to curious, uneducated buyers. This led to four deaths and serious injuries from radiation exposure. Together with [[caesium-134]], [[iodine-131]], and [[strontium-90]], caesium-137 was among the isotopes distributed by the [[Chernobyl disaster]] which constitute the greatest risk to health.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAEA&quot; /&gt; Radioisotopes of francium would presumably be dangerous as well due to their high decay energy and short half-life, but none have been produced in large enough amounts to pose any serious risk.&lt;ref name=andyscouse /&gt;
