'''Apuleius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|p|j|ʊ|ˈ|l|iː|ə|s}}; also called '''Lucius Apuleius Madaurensis''' and in {{Lang-ber|Afulay}} c. 124 – c. 170 AD)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/30917/Lucius-Apuleius &quot;Lucius Apuleius&quot;]. ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Latin]]-language prose writer, platonist philosopher and rhetorian. He was a [[Numidians|Numidian]] who lived under the [[Roman Empire]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Berbers: ... The best known of them were the Roman author Apuleius, the Roman emperor Septimius Severus, and St. Augustine''&quot;, ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', Scholastic Library Publishing, 2005, v.3, p. 569&lt;/ref&gt; and was from [[Madauros]] (now [[M'Daourouch]], [[Algeria]]). He studied [[Platonism]] in [[Athens]], travelled to [[Roman Italy|Italy]], [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia Minor]], and [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]] and was an initiate in several cults or [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mysteries]]. The most famous incident in his life was when he was accused of using magic to gain the attentions (and fortune) of a wealthy widow. He declaimed and then distributed a witty ''tour de force'' in his own defense before the [[proconsul]] and a court of magistrates convened in [[Sabratha]], near ancient [[Tripoli]], Libya. This is known as the ''Apologia''.

His most famous work is his [[ribaldry|bawdy]] [[picaresque novel]], the ''Metamorphoses'', otherwise known as ''[[The Golden Ass]]''. It is the only Latin novel that has survived in its entirety. It relates the ludicrous adventures of one Lucius, who experiments with magic and is accidentally turned into a [[donkey]].

== Life ==
[[File:Opera omnia.tif|thumb|''Apuleii Opera omnia'' (1621)]]
Apuleius was born in Madauros, a [[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]] in [[Numidia]] on the [[North Africa]]n coast bordering [[Gaetuli]]a, and he described himself as &quot;half-Numidian half-Gaetulian.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Apuleius, Apology, 24&quot;&gt;Apuleius, ''Apology'', 24&lt;/ref&gt; Madaurus was the same ''colonia'' where [[Augustine of Hippo]] later received part of his early education, and, though located well away from the [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanized]] coast, is today the site of some pristine Roman ruins. As to his first name, no ''[[praenomen]]'' is given in any ancient source;&lt;ref&gt;P. G. Walsh, (1999) ''The Golden Ass'', page xi. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; late-medieval manuscripts began the tradition of calling him ''Lucius'' from the name of the hero of his novel.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Haig Gaisser, (2008), ''The fortunes of Apuleius and the Golden Ass: a study in transmission and Reception'', page 69. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Details regarding his life come mostly from his defense speech (''Apology'') and his work ''[[Florida (Apuleius)|Florida]]'', which consists of snippets taken from some of his best speeches.

His father was a provincial magistrate (''[[duumvirate|duumvir]]'')&lt;ref name=&quot;Apuleius, Apology, 24&quot; /&gt; who bequeathed at his death the sum of nearly two million [[sestertius|sesterces]] to his two sons.&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, ''Apology'', 23&lt;/ref&gt; Apuleius studied with a master at [[Carthage]] (where he later settled) and later at [[Athens]], where he studied Platonist philosophy among other subjects. He subsequently went to [[Rome]]&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, ''Florida'', 17.4&lt;/ref&gt; to study Latin [[rhetoric]] and, most likely, to speak in the law courts for a time before returning to his native North Africa. He also travelled extensively in Asia Minor and Egypt, studying philosophy and religion, burning up his inheritance while doing so.

Apuleius was an initiate in several [[Greco-Roman mysteries]], including the [[Dionysian Mysteries]].&lt;ref&gt;As he proudly claims in his ''Apologia''. (Winter, Thomas Nelson (2006) [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=classicsfacpub ''Apology as Prosecution: The Trial of Apuleius''])&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a priest of [[Asclepius]]&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, ''Florida'' 16.38 and 18.38&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to Augustine,&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''Epistle'' 138.19.&lt;/ref&gt; ''sacerdos provinciae Africae'' (i.e., priest of the province of Carthage).

Not long after his return home he set out upon a new journey to [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Apuleius, Apology, 72&quot;&gt;Apuleius, ''Apology'', 72.&lt;/ref&gt; On his way there he was taken ill at the town of [[Oea]] (modern-day [[Tripoli]]) and was hospitably received into the house of Sicinius Pontianus, with whom he had been friends when he had studied in Athens.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apuleius, Apology, 72&quot; /&gt; The mother of Pontianus, Pudentilla, was a very rich widow. With her son's consent&amp;nbsp;– indeed encouragement&amp;nbsp;– Apuleius agreed to marry her.&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, ''Apology'', 73&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Pontianus himself married the daughter of one Herennius Rufinus; he, indignant that Pudentilla's wealth should pass out of the family, instigated his son-in-law, together with a younger brother, Sicinius Pudens, a mere boy, and their paternal uncle, Sicinius Aemilianus, to join him in impeaching Apuleius upon the charge that he had gained the affections of Pudentilla by charms and magic spells.&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, ''Apology'', 53, 66, 70, etc&lt;/ref&gt; The case was heard at [[Sabratha]], near Tripoli, c.&amp;nbsp;158&amp;nbsp;AD, before [[Claudius Maximus]], [[proconsul]] of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, ''Apology'', 1, 59, 65&lt;/ref&gt; The accusation itself seems to have been ridiculous, and the spirited and triumphant defence spoken by Apuleius is still extant. This is known as the ''Apologia (A Discourse on Magic)''.

Apuleius accused an extravagant personal enemy of turning his house into a brothel and prostituting his own wife.&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, ''Apology'', 75–76; Rebecca Flemming (1999), &quot;''Quae corpore quaestum facit'': The Sexual Economy of Female Prostitution in the Roman Empire,&quot; ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 89, p.&amp;nbsp;41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of his subsequent career we know little. Judging from the many works of which he was author, he must have devoted himself diligently to literature. He occasionally gave speeches in public to great reception; he had the charge of exhibiting gladiatorial shows and wild beast events in the province, and statues were erected in his honor by the senate of Carthage and of other senates.&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, ''Apology'', 55, 73; ''Florida'', iii. n. 16; Augustine, ''Ep. '' v.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Golden Ass'' ===
{{Main article|The Golden Ass}}
''The Golden Ass'' (''Asinus Aureus'') or ''Metamorphoses'' is the only [[Latin language|Latin]] novel that has survived in its entirety. It is an imaginative, irreverent, and amusing work that relates the ludicrous adventures of one Lucius, who experiments with magic and is accidentally turned into an [[donkey|ass]]. In this guise he hears and sees many unusual things, until escaping from his predicament in a rather unexpected way. Within this [[frame story]] are found many [[story within a story|digressions]], the longest among them being the well-known tale of [[Cupid and Psyche]].

The ''Metamorphoses'' ends with the (once again human) hero, Lucius, eager to be initiated into the [[mysteries of Isis|mystery cult of Isis]]; he abstains from forbidden foods, bathes, and purifies himself. He is introduced to the ''[[Navigium Isidis]]''. Then the secrets of the cult's books are explained to him, and further secrets are revealed before he goes through the process of initiation, which involves a trial by the elements in a journey to the underworld. Lucius is then asked to seek initiation into the cult of [[Osiris]] in Rome, and eventually is initiated into the ''pastophoroi''&amp;nbsp;– a group of priests that serves Isis and Osiris.&lt;ref&gt;Iles Johnson, Sarah, ''Mysteries'', in ''Ancient Religions'' pp. 104–5, The Belknap Press of Harvard University (2007), {{ISBN|978-0-674-02548-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adventures of the ass stand at the beginning of the [[picaresque novel]] tradition which eventually produced ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Companion to English Literature, 6th Edition. Edited by Margaret Drabble, Oxford University Press, 2000 Pp 35&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other works ===
His other works are:

* ''Apologia (A Discourse on Magic)''. Apuleius' courtroom defense. The work is a stylish defence against his opponents, with little reference to magic.
* ''Florida''. A compilation of twenty-three extracts from his various speeches and lectures.
* ''De Platone et dogmate eius (On Plato and his Doctrine)''. An outline in two books of [[Plato]]'s physics and ethics, preceded by a life of Plato
* ''De Deo Socratis (On the God of Socrates)''. A work on the existence and nature of [[Daemon (classical mythology)|demons]], the intermediaries between gods and humans. This treatise was roughly attacked by Augustine of Hippo. It contains a passage comparing gods and kings which is the first recorded occurrence of the proverb &quot;familiarity breeds contempt&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=149 |title=Apuleius |author=S. J. Harrison |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-19-927138-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|''parit enim conversatio contemptum, raritas conciliat admirationem''&lt;br /&gt;(familiarity breeds contempt, rarity brings admiration)}}
* ''On the Universe''. This Latin translation of the work ''[[On the Universe|De Mundo]]'' is probably by Apuleius.

Apuleius wrote many other works which have not survived. He wrote works of [[poetry]] and [[fiction]], as well as technical treatises on [[politics]], [[dendrology]], [[agriculture]], [[medicine]], [[natural history]], [[astronomy]], [[music]], and [[arithmetic]], and he translated Plato's ''[[Phaedo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;P. G. Walsh, (1999) ''The Golden Ass'', pages xiv–xv. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spurious works ===
The extant works wrongly attributed to Apuleius are:&lt;ref&gt;Mark P. O. Morford, (2002), ''The Roman philosophers'', page 227. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Peri Hermeneias'' (''On interpretation''). A brief Latin version of a guide to [[Aristotelian logic]].
* ''Asclepius''. A Latin paraphrase of a lost Greek dialogue (''The perfect discourse'') featuring [[Asclepius]] and [[Hermes Trismegistus]].
