The '''Austrian School''' is a [[Schools of economic thought|school of economic thought]] that is based on [[methodological individualism]] – the concept that social phenomena result from the motivations and actions of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Menger, Principles of Economics, online at https://www.mises.org/etexts/menger/principles.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/methodological-individualism/ Methodological Individualism at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mises_Action&quot;&gt;Ludwig von Mises.  [[Human Action]], p. 11, &quot;Purposeful Action and Animal Reaction&quot;. Referenced 2011-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt; It originated in late-19th and early-20th century Vienna with the work of [[Carl Menger]], [[Eugen Böhm von Bawerk]], [[Friedrich von Wieser]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Schumpeter, History of economic analysis, Oxford University Press 1996, {{ISBN|978-0195105599}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was methodologically opposed to the [[Historical school of economics|Prussian Historical School]] (in a dispute known as [[Methodenstreit]]). Current-day economists working in this tradition are located in many different countries, but their work is still referred to as '''Austrian economics'''.

Among the theoretical contributions of the early years of the Austrian School are the [[subjective theory of value]], [[marginalism]] in [[microeconomics|price theory]], and the formulation of the [[economic calculation problem]], each of which has become an accepted part of [[mainstream economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Birner | first1 = Jack | first2 = Rudy | last2 = van Zijp | title = Hayek, Co-ordination and Evolution: His Legacy in Philosophy, Politics, Economics and the History of Ideas | location = London, New York | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year= 1994 | page = 94 | isbn = 978-0-415-09397-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Jean-baptiste Say.jpg|right|thumb|130px|[[Jean-Baptiste Say]]]]

=== Etymology ===
The Austrian School owes its name to members of the German [[historical school of economics]], who argued against the Austrians during the late-19th century ''[[Methodenstreit]]'' (&quot;methodology struggle&quot;), in which the Austrians defended the role of theory in economics as distinct from the study or compilation of historical circumstance. In 1883, Menger published ''Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences with Special Reference to Economics'', which attacked the methods of the Historical school. [[Gustav von Schmoller]], a leader of the Historical school, responded with an unfavorable review, coining the term &quot;Austrian School&quot; in an attempt to characterize the school as outcast and provincial.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Menger’s approach – haughtily dismissed by the leader of the German Historical School, Gustav Schmoller, as merely “Austrian,” the origin of that label – led to a renaissance of theoretical economics in Europe and, later, in the United States.&quot; [[Peter G. Klein]], 2007; in the Foreword to ''Principles of Economics'', Carl Menger; trns. James Dingwall and Bert F. Hoselitz, 1976; Ludwig von Mises Institute, Alabama; 2007; {{ISBN|978-1-933550-12-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The label endured and was adopted by the adherents themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Mises|first=Ludwig|title=The Historical Setting of the Austrian School of Economics|year=1984|origyear=1969|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute.|url=https://mises.org/etexts/histsetting.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Wave===
[[File:CarlMenger.png|right|thumb|130px|[[Carl Menger]]]]
The school originated in [[Vienna]], in the [[Austrian Empire]]. [[Carl Menger]]'s 1871 book, ''[[Principles of Economics (Menger)|Principles of Economics]]'', is generally considered the founding of the Austrian School. The book was one of the first modern treatises to advance the theory of [[marginal utility]]. The Austrian School was one of three founding currents of the marginalist revolution of the 1870s, with its major contribution being the introduction of the subjectivist approach in economics.&lt;ref name=keizer&gt;{{cite book |last=Keizer |first=Willem |title=Austrian Economics in Debate |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-415-14054-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2011}} While marginalism was generally influential, there was also a more specific school that began to coalesce around Menger's work, which came to be known as the “Psychological School,” “Vienna School,” or “Austrian School.”&lt;ref&gt;Israel M. Kirzner (1987). &quot;Austrian School of Economics,&quot; ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 1, pp. 145–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Menger's contributions to economic theory were closely followed by those of [[Eugen Böhm von Bawerk]] and [[Friedrich von Wieser]]. These three economists became what is known as the &quot;first wave&quot; of the Austrian School. Böhm-Bawerk wrote extensive critiques of [[Karl Marx]] in the 1880s and 1890s, as was part of the Austrians' participation in the late 19th-century ''[[Methodenstreit]]'', during which they attacked the [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] doctrines of the [[Historical school of economics|Historical School]].

===Early twentieth century===
[[Frank Albert Fetter]] (1863-1949) was a leader in the United States of Austrian thought; he obtained his PhD in 1894 from the [[University of Halle]] and then was made Professor of Political Economy and Finance at [[Cornell University|Cornell]] in 1901. Several important Austrian economists trained at the University of Vienna in the 1920s and later participated in private seminars held by [[Ludwig von Mises]]. These included [[Gottfried Haberler]],&lt;ref&gt;https://mises.org/page/1452/Biography-of-Gottfried-Haberler-19011995&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Fritz Machlup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of Fritz Machlup|url=https://mises.org/page/1457/Biography-of-Fritz-Machlup-19021983|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Menger]] (son of Carl Menger),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iit.edu/csl/am/about/menger/about.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Oskar Morgenstern,&lt;ref&gt;http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/morgenst/&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Rosenstein-Rodan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.lse.ac.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&amp;id=COLL+MISC+0324 |title=Rodan; Paul Rosenstein (1902-1985); political economist|publisher= Archive at London School of Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Wald]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Abraham Wald, 1902–1950|author=Oskar Morgenstern|journal=Econometrica

===Later twentieth century===
[[File:Israel Kirzner.jpg|right|thumb|130px|[[Israel Kirzner]]]]

By the mid-1930s, most economists had embraced what they considered the important contributions of the early Austrians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boettke and Leeson&quot;/&gt; Fritz Machlup quoted Hayek's statement, &quot;the greatest success of a school is that it stops existing because its fundamental teachings have become parts of the general body of commonly accepted thought.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://mises.org/daily/1700/Ludwig-von-Mises-A-Scholar-Who-Would-Not-Compromise Homage to Mises by Fritz Machlup 1981&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometime during the middle of the twentieth century, Austrian economics became disregarded or derided by mainstream economists because it rejected [[economic model|model]] building, and mathematical and statistical methods in the study of economics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Backhouse&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| last=Backhouse| first=Roger E| title=Austrian economics and the mainstream: View from the boundary| journal=The Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics |volume=3 |issue=2 | pages=31–43 | url=https://mises.org/library/austrian-economics-and-mainstream-view-boundary |date=January 2000  |accessdate=2017-01-24 |quote=&quot;Hayek did not fall out of favor because he was not Keynesian (neither are Friedman or Lucas) but because he was perceived to be doing neither rigorous theory nor empirical work&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mises' student, [[Israel Kirzner]] recalled that in 1954, when Kirzner was pursuing his PhD, there was no separate Austrian School as such. When Kirzner was deciding which graduate school to attend, Mises had advised him to accept an offer of admission at Johns Hopkins because it was a prestigious university and [[Fritz Machlup]] taught there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kirzner|first=Israel|title=Interview of Israel Kirzner|url=https://www.mises.org/journals/aen/aen17_1_1.asp|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1940s, Austrian economics can be divided into two schools of economic thought, and the school &quot;split&quot; to some degree in the late 20th century. One camp of Austrians, exemplified by Mises, regards neoclassical methodology to be irredeemably flawed; the other camp, exemplified by Friedrich Hayek, accepts a large part of neoclassical methodology and is more accepting of government intervention in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;https://mises.org/journals/qjae/pdf/qjae7_1_3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Hazlitt]] wrote economics columns and editorials for a number of publications and wrote many books on the topic of Austrian economics from the 1930s to the 1980s. Hazlitt's thinking was influenced by Mises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreemanonline.org/featured/remembering-henry-hazlitt/ |title=Remembering Henry Hazlitt |publisher=[[The Freeman]] |date= |accessdate=2013-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''[[Economics in One Lesson]]'' (1946) sold over a million copies, and he is also known for ''[[The Failure of the New Economics|The Failure of the &quot;New Economics&quot;]]'' (1959), a line-by-line critique of [[John Maynard Keynes]]'s ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money|General Theory]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/about/3233 |title=Biography of Henry Hazlitt |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |date= |accessdate=2013-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reputation of the Austrian School rose in the late-20th century due in part to the work of Israel Kirzner and [[Ludwig Lachmann]] at [[New York University]], and to renewed public awareness of the work of Hayek after he won the 1974 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meijer 1995&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor=Meijer, Gerrit |title=New Perspectives on Austrian Economics |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-415-12283-2 |oclc= 70769328  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek's work was influential in the revival of ''laissez-faire'' thought in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=raico&gt;{{cite web |url= https://mises.org/etexts/austrianliberalism.asp |title=Austrian Economics and Classical Liberalism |first=Ralph |last=Raico |work=mises.org |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |year=2011 |quote=despite the particular policy views of its founders ...

===Split among contemporary Austrians===
According to economist [[Bryan Caplan]], by the late twentieth century, a split had developed among those who self-identify with the Austrian School. One group, building on the work of Hayek, follows the broad framework of mainstream neoclassical economics, including its use of mathematical models and general equilibrium, and brings a critical perspective to mainstream methodology merely influenced by the Austrian notions such as the [[economic calculation problem]] and the independent role of logical reasoning in developing economic theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Austrian Search&quot;/&gt;

[[File:MurrayBW.jpg|right|thumb|130px|[[Murray Rothbard]]]]
A second group, following Mises and Rothbard, rejects the neoclassical theories of consumer and welfare economics, dismisses empirical methods and mathematical and statistical models as inapplicable to economic science, and asserts that economic theory went entirely astray in the twentieth century; they offer the Misesian view as a radical alternative paradigm to mainstream theory. Caplan wrote that if &quot;Mises and Rothbard are right, then [mainstream] economics is wrong; but if Hayek is right, then mainstream economics merely needs to adjust its focus.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Austrian Search&quot;/&gt;

Economist [[Leland Yeager]] discussed the late twentieth century rift and referred to a discussion written by Murray Rothbard, [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]], [[Joseph Salerno]], and others in which they attack and disparage Hayek. Yeager stated, &quot;To try to drive a wedge between Mises and Hayek on [the role of knowledge in economic calculation], especially to the disparagement of Hayek, is unfair to these two great men, unfaithful to the history of economic thought&quot; and went on to call the rift subversive to economic analysis and the historical understanding of the fall of Eastern European communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yaeger|first=Leland|title=Is the Market a Test of Truth and Beauty?: Essays in Political Economy|pages=93 ff|year=2011|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1999 book published by the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] (Mises Institute),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoppe|first=Hans-Hermann|title=15 Great Austrian Economists – Murray Rothbard|year=1999|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|location=Alabama|pages=223 ff.|url=https://mises.org/books/15great.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hans-Hermann Hoppe asserted that Murray Rothbard was the leader of the &quot;mainstream within Austrian Economics&quot; and contrasted Rothbard with Nobel Laureate Friedrich Hayek, whom he identified as a [[British empiricism|British empiricist]] and an opponent of the thought of Mises and Rothbard. Hoppe acknowledged that Hayek was the most prominent Austrian economist within academia, but stated that Hayek was an opponent of the Austrian tradition which led from Carl Menger and Böhm-Bawerk through Mises to Rothbard. Austrian economist [[Walter Block]] says that the &quot;Austrian school&quot; can be distinguished from other schools of economic thought through two categories – economic theory and political theory. According to Block, while Hayek can be considered an &quot;Austrian economist&quot;, his views on political theory clash with the libertarian political theory which Block sees as an integral part of the Austrian school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Walter Block: Austrian vs Chicago Schools|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiX7dzyHkK4|publisher=Mises Canada : Rothbard School 2014|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, both criticisms from Hoppe and Block to Hayek seem to apply to the founder of the Austrian School, Carl Menger, too. Hoppe emphasizes that Hayek, which for him is from the English empirical tradition, is an opponent of the supposed rationalist tradition of the Austrian School. However, Carl Menger made strong critiques to rationalism in his works, in similar vein as Hayek's.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://mises.org/system/tdf/Investigations%20into%20the%20Method%20of%20the%20Social%20Sciences_5.pdf?file=1&amp;type=document|title=Investigations into the Methods of the Social Sciences|last=Menger|first=Carl|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=173–175|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized the idea that there are several institutions which were not deliberately created, have a kind of 'superior wisdom' and serves important functions to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://mises.org/system/tdf/Investigations%20into%20the%20Method%20of%20the%20Social%20Sciences_5.pdf?file=1&amp;type=document|title=Investigations into the Methods of the Social Sciences|last=Menger|first=Carl|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=146–147|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://mises.org/system/tdf/Investigations%20into%20the%20Method%20of%20the%20Social%20Sciences_5.pdf?file=1&amp;type=document|title=Investigations into the Methods of the Social Sciences|last=Menger|first=Carl|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=91|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also talked about Burke and the English tradition to sustain these positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Block, when saying that the libertarian political theory is an integral part of the Austrian School, and supposing Hayek isn't a libertarian, excludes Menger from the Austrian School too, once Menger seems to defend broader state activity than Hayek. As examples, progressive taxation and extensive labour legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.hetsa.org.au/hetsa2009/conference_papers/7.%20Yukihiro%20Ikeda%20Carl%20Menger's%20Liberalism%20Revisited.pdf|title=Carl Menger's Liberalism Revisited|last=Ikeda|first=Yukihiro|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists of the Hayekian view are affiliated with the [[Cato Institute]], [[George Mason University]] (GMU), and New York University, among other institutions. They include [[Peter Boettke]], [[Roger Garrison]], [[Steven Horwitz]], [[Peter Leeson]] and [[George Reisman]]. Economists of the Mises–Rothbard view include [[Walter Block]], [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]], [[Jesús Huerta de Soto]] and [[Robert P.

==Methodology==
{{Main article|Action axiom|Catallactics|Praxeology}}

The Austrian School theorizes that the subjective choices of individuals including individual knowledge, time, expectation, and other subjective factors, cause all economic phenomena. Austrians seek to understand the economy by examining the social ramifications of individual choice, an approach called ''[[methodological individualism]]''. It differs from other schools of economic thought, which have focused on aggregate variables, equilibrium analysis, and societal groups rather than individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;White Methodology&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Lawrence H.|title=The Methodology of the Austrian School Economists|year=2003|edition=revised|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|url=https://mises.org/mofase.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ludwig von Mises.jpg|right|thumb|130px|[[Ludwig von Mises]]]]
In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, economists with a methodological lineage to the early Austrian School developed many diverse approaches and theoretical orientations. For example, in 1949, [[Ludwig von Mises]] organized his version of the subjectivist approach, which he called &quot;[[praxeology]]&quot;, in a book published in English as ''[[Human Action]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludwigvon&quot;&gt;Ludwig von Mises, Nationalökonomie (Geneva: Union, 1940); Human Action (Auburn, Ala.: Ludwig von Mises Institute, [1949] 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} In it, Mises stated that praxeology could be used to deduce ''a priori'' theoretical economic truths and that deductive economic [[thought experiment]]s could yield conclusions which follow irrefutably from the underlying assumptions. He wrote that conclusions could not be inferred from empirical observation or statistical analysis and argued against the use of probabilities in economic models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mises.org/books/ufofes/ |title=The Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science by Ludwig von Mises |publisher=Mises.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Mises' time, some Austrian thinkers have accepted his praxeological approach, while others have adopted alternative methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce J. Caldwell &quot;Praxeology and its Critics: an Appraisal&quot; History of Political Economy Fall 1984 16(3): 363–79; {{DOI|10.1215/00182702-16-3-363}}  {{cite web|url= http://public.econ.duke.edu/~bjc18/docs/Praxeology%20and%20Its%20Critics.pdf |title=Praxeology and Its Critics }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Fritz Machlup]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], and others, did not take Mises' strong ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' approach to economics.&lt;ref&gt;Richard N. Langlois, &quot;From the Knowledge of Economics to the Economics of Knowledge: Fritz Machlup on Methodology and on the &quot;Knowledge Society&quot;.  Research in the History of Economic Thought and Methodology, Volume 3, {{cite web|url= http://web.uconn.edu/ciom/Machlup%20Knowledge%20(1985).pdf |title=Machlup Knowledge }}, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|225–35}}  [[Ludwig Lachmann]], a radical subjectivist, also largely rejected Mises' formulation of Praxeology in favor of the ''verstehende Methode'' (interpretive method) articulated by [[Max Weber]].&lt;ref name=&quot;White Methodology&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ludwig&gt;{{cite book|last=Lachmann|first=Ludwig|title=Macroeconomic Thinking and the Market Economy|year=1973|publisher=Institute of Economic Affairs|url=http://library.freecapitalists.org/books/Ludwig%20M%20Lachmann/Macro-economic%20thinking%20and%20the%20Market%20Economy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, various Austrians incorporated models and mathematics into their analysis. Austrian economist [[Steven Horwitz]] argued in 2000, that Austrian methodology is consistent with [[macroeconomics]] and that Austrian macroeconomics can be expressed in terms of [[microeconomics|microeconomic]] foundations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horwitz, Steven 2000&quot;&gt;Horwitz, Steven: Microfoundations and Macroeconomics: An Austrian Perspective (2000)|''Routledge''&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian economist Roger Garrison writes that Austrian macroeconomic theory can be correctly expressed in terms of [[diagram|diagrammatic models]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.freecapitalists.org/books/Roger%20W%20Garrison/Austrian%20Macroeconomics%20A%20Diagrammatical%20Exposition.pdf |last=Garrison|first=Roger|title=Austrian Macroeconomics: A Diagrammatical Exposition|year=1978|publisher=Institute for Humane Studies|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, Austrian economist Oskar Morgenstern presented a rigorous schematization of an ordinal utility function (the [[Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem]]) in [[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;Neumann, John von and Morgenstern, Oskar Theory of Games and Economic Behavior. Princeton, NJ. Princeton University Press. 1944&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamental tenets==
In 1981, [[Fritz Machlup]] listed the typical views of Austrian economic thinking as:&lt;ref name=&quot;Machlup Mises&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Machlup |first=Fritz |authorlink=Fritz Machlup |title=Homage to Mises |url=https://www.mises.org/daily/1700 |publisher=Hillsdale College |accessdate=8 August 2013|pages=19–27|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Methodological Individualism]]: In the explanation of economic phenomena, we have to go back to the actions (or inaction) of individuals; groups or &quot;collectives&quot; cannot act except through the actions of individual members.
* Methodological Subjectivism: In the explanation of economic phenomena, we have to go back to judgments and choices made by individuals on the basis of whatever knowledge they have or believe to have and whatever expectations they entertain regarding external developments and especially the perceived consequences of their own intended actions.
* Tastes and Preferences: Subjective valuations of goods and services determine the demand for them so that their prices are influenced by (actual and potential) consumers.
* Opportunity Costs: The costs with which producers and other economic actors calculate reflect the alternative opportunities that must be foregone; as productive services are employed for one purpose, all alternative uses have to be sacrificed.
* [[Marginalism]]: In all economic designs, the values, costs, revenues, productivity, etc., are determined by the significance of the last unit added to or subtracted from the total.
* Time Structure of Production and Consumption: Decisions to save reflect &quot;time preferences&quot; regarding  consumption in the immediate, distant, or indefinite future, and investments are made in view of larger outputs expected to be obtained if more time-taking production processes are undertaken.

He included two additional tenets held by the Mises branch of Austrian economics:
* Consumer Sovereignty: The influence consumers have on the effective demand for goods and services and, through the prices which result in free competitive markets, on the production plans of producers and investors, is not merely a hard fact but also an important objective, attainable only by complete avoidance of governmental interference with the markets and of restrictions on the freedom of sellers and buyers to follow their own judgment regarding quantities, qualities, and prices of products and services.
* Political Individualism: Only when individuals are given full economic freedom will it be possible to secure political and moral freedom. Restrictions on economic freedom lead, sooner or later, to an extension of the coercive activities of the state into the political domain, undermining and eventually destroying the essential individual liberties which the capitalistic societies were able to attain in the nineteenth century.

===Opportunity cost===
{{Main article|Opportunity cost}}
[[File:1wieser.jpg|right|thumb|130px|[[Friedrich von Wieser]]]]
The opportunity cost doctrine was first explicitly formulated by the Austrian economist [[Friedrich von Wieser]] in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Subjectivism, intelligibility and economic understanding: essays in honor of Ludwig M. Lachmann on his eightieth birthday |last1=Kirzner |first1=Israel M. |last2=Lachman |first2=Ludwig M. |publisher=McMillan |year=1986 |edition=Illustrated |isbn=978-0-333-41788-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opportunity cost is the cost of any activity measured in terms of the value of the next best alternative foregone (that is not chosen). It is the sacrifice related to the second best choice available to someone, or group, who has picked among several [[mutually exclusive]] choices.&lt;ref name=&quot;investopedia&quot;&gt;{{cite web |work=Investopedia |title=Opportunity Cost |url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp |accessdate=2010-09-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100914214221/http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp| archivedate= 14 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opportunity cost is a key concept in mainstream [[economics]], and has been described as expressing &quot;the basic relationship between [[scarcity]] and [[utility|choice]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/search_results?q=opportunity+cost&amp;edition=current&amp;button_search=GO |title=Opportunity cost |encyclopedia=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics Online |author=James M.

===Capital and interest===
{{See also|Capital and Interest|Marginalism|Neutrality of money|Time preference}}
[[File:1Bawerk.png|right|thumb|130px|[[Eugen Böhm von Bawerk]]]]
The Austrian theory of capital and interest was first developed by [[Eugen Böhm von Bawerk]]. He stated that interest rates and profits are determined by two factors, namely, [[supply and demand]] in the market for final goods and time preference.&lt;ref name=&quot;BohmBawerkEugen&quot;&gt;Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen Ritter von; ''Kapital Und Kapitalizns. Zweite Abteilung: Positive Theorie des Kapitales'' (1889). Translated as ''Capital and Interest. II: Positive Theory of Capital'' with appendices rendered as ''Further Essays on Capital and Interest''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Böhm-Bawerk's theory equates [[capital intensity]] with the degree of [[roundaboutness]] of production processes. Böhm-Bawerk also argued that the law of [[marginal utility]] necessarily implies the classical law of costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;BohmBawerkEugen&quot; /&gt; Some Austrian economists therefore entirely reject the notion that interest rates are affected by [[liquidity preference]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Inflation===
{{See also|Monetary inflation}}
In Mises's definition, inflation is an increase in the supply of money:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ludwig |last=von Mises |chapter=Economic Freedom and Interventionism |editor1-first=Bettina B. |editor1-last=Greaves |title=Economics of Mobilization |publisher=The Commercial and Financial Chronicle |location=Sulphur Springs, West Virginia |pages= |year=1980 |isbn= |chapterurl=https://mises.org/efandi/ch20.asp |ref=harv |quote=&quot;Inflation, as this term was always used everywhere and especially in this country, means increasing the quantity of money and bank notes in circulation and the quantity of bank deposits subject to check. But people today use the term &quot;inflation&quot; to refer to the phenomenon that is an inevitable consequence of inflation, that is the tendency of all prices and wage rates to rise. The result of this deplorable confusion is that there is no term left to signify the cause of this rise in prices and wages. There is no longer any word available to signify the phenomenon that has been, up to now, called inflation ... As you cannot talk about something that has no name, you cannot fight it. Those who pretend to fight inflation are in fact only fighting what is the inevitable consequence of inflation, rising prices. Their ventures are doomed to failure because they do not attack the root of the evil. They try to keep prices low while firmly committed to a policy of increasing the quantity of money that must necessarily make them soar. As long as this terminological confusion is not entirely wiped out, there cannot be any question of stopping inflation.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In theoretical investigation there is only one meaning that can rationally be attached to the expression Inflation: an increase in the quantity of money (in the broader sense of the term, so as to include fiduciary media as well), that is not offset by a corresponding increase in the need for money (again in the broader sense of the term), so that a fall in the objective exchange-value of money must occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheTheory&quot;&gt;The Theory of Money and Credit, Mises (1912, [1981], p. 272)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hayek pointed out that inflationary stimulation exploits the lag between an increase in money supply and the consequent increase in the prices of goods and services:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And since any inflation, however modest at first, can help employment only so long as it accelerates, adopted as a means of reducing unemployment, it will do so for any length of time only while it accelerates. &quot;Mild&quot; steady inflation cannot help—it can lead only to outright inflation. That inflation at a constant rate soon ceases to have any stimulating effect, and in the end merely leaves us with a backlog of delayed adaptations, is the conclusive argument against the &quot;mild&quot; inflation represented as beneficial even in standard economics textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;Hayek, Friedrich August  [https://books.google.com/books?id=zZu3AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22only+while+it+accelerates%22&amp;dq=%22only+while+it+accelerates%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HBhsUYjUGMv34QSW-YDgDg&amp;redir_esc=y 1980s Unemployment and the Unions: Essays on the Impotent Price Structure of Britain and Monopoly in the Labour Market] Institute of Economic Affairs, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic calculation problem===
{{Main article|Economic calculation problem}}
{{refimprove section|date=May 2013}}
[[File:Friedrich Hayek portrait.jpg|right|thumb|130px|[[Friedrich Hayek]]]]
The economic calculation problem refers to a criticism of [[socialist economics|socialism]] which was first stated by [[Max Weber]] in 1920. Mises subsequently discussed Weber's idea with his student Friedrich Hayek, who developed it in various works including ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite book |title=Economic calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth |accessdate=2008-09-08 |last=Von Mises |first=Ludwig |authorlink=Ludwig von Mises |year=1990|format=PDF |publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] |url=https://mises.org/pdf/econcalc.pdf |isbn=0-945466-07-2 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080923191714/https://mises.org/pdf/econcalc.pdf| archivedate= 23 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. A. Hayek, (1935), &quot;The Nature and History of the Problem&quot; and &quot;The Present State of the Debate,&quot; om in F. A. Hayek, ed. ''Collectivist Economic Planning'', pp. 1–40, 201–43.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem concerns the means by which resources are allocated and distributed in an economy.

Austrian theory emphasizes the [[spontaneous order|organizing power]] of markets. Hayek stated that market prices reflect information, the totality of which is not known to any single individual, which determines the allocation of resources in an economy.  Because socialist systems lack the individual incentives and [[price discovery]] processes by which individuals act on their personal information,  Hayek argued that socialist economic planners lack all of the knowledge required to make optimal decisions.  Those who agree with this criticism view it as a refutation of socialism showing that socialism is not a viable or sustainable form of economic organization. The debate rose to prominence in the 1920s and 1930s, and that specific period of the debate has come to be known by historians of economic thought as ''The Socialist Calculation Debate.''&lt;ref name=&quot;School&quot;&gt;[http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/paretian/social.htm The socialist calculation debate] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218142504/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/paretian/social.htm |date=February 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mises argued in a 1920 essay &quot;[[Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth]]&quot; that the pricing systems in socialist economies were necessarily deficient because if government owned the [[means of production]], then no prices could be obtained for [[capital good]]s as they were merely internal transfers of goods in a socialist system and not &quot;objects of exchange,&quot; unlike final goods. Therefore, they were unpriced and hence the system would be necessarily inefficient since the central planners would not know how to allocate the available resources efficiently.&lt;ref name=&quot;School&quot; /&gt;  This led him to write &quot;that rational economic activity is impossible in a socialist commonwealth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mises&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mises.org/humanaction/chap2sec4.asp|author=Ludwig von Mises|title=The Principle of Methodological Individualism|work=Human Action|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|accessdate=2009-04-24| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090422004804/https://mises.org/humanaction/chap2sec4.asp| archivedate= 22 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business cycles===
{{Main article|Austrian business cycle theory}}
{{refimprove section|date=May 2013}}
The Austrian theory of the [[business cycle]]  (&quot;ABCT&quot;) focuses on banks' issuance of credit as the cause of economic fluctuations. Although later elaborated by Hayek and others, the theory was first set forth by Mises, who believed that banks extend credit at artificially low interest rates, causing businesses to invest in relatively [[Roundaboutness|roundabout]] production processes.  Mises stated that this led to a misallocation of resources which he called ''[[malinvestment]]''.

====Role of government disputed====
According to [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[central bank]]s enable the commercial banks to fund loans at artificially low interest rates, thereby inducing an unsustainable expansion of bank credit and impeding any subsequent contraction.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;''[[America's Great Depression]]'', [[Murray Rothbard]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Hayek]] disagreed.  Prior to the 1970s, Hayek did not favor [[laissez-faire]] in banking and said that a freely competitive banking industry tends to be endogenously destabilizing and pro-cyclical, mimicking the effects which Rothbard attributed to central bank policy.  Hayek stated that the need for [[central banking]] control was inescapable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=Lawrence H.|title=Why Didn't Hayek Favor Laissez Faire in Banking?|journal=History of Political Economy|year=1999|volume=31|issue=4|url=http://cameroneconomics.com/white-hayek-hope.pdf|accessdate=11 April 2013|doi=10.1215/00182702-31-4-753|page=753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Many theories developed by &quot;first wave&quot; Austrian economists have long been absorbed into [[mainstream economics]].&lt;ref&gt;It has also influenced related disciplines such as Law and Economics, see. K. Grechenig, M. Litschka, Law by Human Intent or Evolution? Some Remarks on the Austrian School of Economics' Role in the Development of Law and Economics, European Journal of Law and Economics (EJLE) 2010, vol. 29 (1), pp. 57–79.&lt;/ref&gt; These include Carl Menger's theories on marginal utility, Friedrich von Wieser's theories on [[opportunity cost]], and Eugen Böhm von Bawerk's theories on time preference, as well as Menger and Böhm-Bawerk's criticisms of [[Marxian economics]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Former [[U.S. Federal Reserve]] Chairman [[Alan Greenspan]] said that the founders of the Austrian School &quot;reached far into the future from when most of them practiced and have had a profound and, in my judgment, probably an irreversible effect on how most mainstream economists think in this country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Greenspan, Alan. &quot;Hearings before the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Financial Services.&quot; U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Financial Services. Washington D.C.. 25 July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Nobel Laureate [[James M. Buchanan]]  told an interviewer, &quot;I have no objections to being called an Austrian. Hayek and Mises might consider me an Austrian but, surely some of the others would not.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/journals/aen/aen9_1_1.asp An Interview with Laureate James Buchanan] Austrian Economics Newsletter: Volume 9, Number 1; Fall 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese economist [[Zhang Weiying]] supports some Austrian theories such as the Austrian theory of the business cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Weiyin, Zhang, &quot;Completely bury Keynesianism&quot;, http://finance.sina.com.cn/20090217/10345864499_3.shtml (February 17, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

===General criticisms===
Mainstream economists have argued that Austrians are excessively averse to the use of mathematics and statistics in economics.&lt;ref name=&quot;white1&quot;/&gt;

Economist [[Bryan Caplan]] argues that many Austrians have not understood valid contributions of modern mainstream economics, causing them to overstate their differences with it. For example, Murray Rothbard stated that he objected to the use of [[cardinal utility]] in microeconomic theory. Caplan says that Rothbard did not understand the position he was attacking, because microeconomic theorists go to great pains to show that their results hold for any [[monotonic]] transformation of an [[ordinal utility]] function, and do not entail cardinal utility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Austrian Search&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Caplan_ord&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/whyaust.htm|title=Why I Am Not an Austrian Economist |last=Caplan |first=Bryan |publisher=[[George Mason University]] |accessdate=2008-07-04 | quote=According to Rothbard, the mainstream approach credulously accepted the use of cardinal utility, when only the use of ordinal utility is defensible. As Rothbard insists, &quot;Value scales of each individual are purely ordinal, and there is no way whatever of measuring the distance between the rankings; indeed, any concept of such distance is a fallacious one.&quot; ... As plausible as Rothbard sounds on this issue, he simply does not understand the position he is attacking. The utility function approach is based as squarely on ordinal utility as Rothbard's is. The modern neoclassical theorists – such as Arrow and Debreau – who developed the utility function approach went out of their way to avoid the use of cardinal utility ... To sum up, Rothbard falsely accused neoclassical utility theory of assuming cardinality. It does not.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] has stated that because Austrians do not use &quot;explicit models&quot; they are unaware of holes in their own thinking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krugman 2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/martin-and-the-austrians |title=The Conscience of a Liberal: Martin And The Austrians |last=Krugman |first=Paul |date=7 April 2010 |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |accessdate=2011-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist Benjamin Klein has criticized the economic methodological work of Austrian economist [[Israel M. Kirzner]]. While praising Kirzner for highlighting shortcomings in traditional methodology, Klein argued that Kirzner did not provide a viable alternative for economic methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Benjamin. &quot;Book review: ''Competition and Entrepreneurship''&quot; (by [[Israel M. Kirzner]], University of Chicago Press, 1973) ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]''.

Can this be used as a reference instead please? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Economist Tyler Cowen has written that Kirzner's theory of entrepreneurship can ultimately be reduced to a neoclassical search model and is thus not in the radical subjectivist tradition of Austrian praxeology. Cowen states that Kirzner's entrepreneurs can be modeled in mainstream terms of search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cowen|first=Tyler|title=Entrepreneurship, Austrian Economics, and the Quarrel Between Philosophy and Poetry|journal=Review of Austrian Economics|date=May 2003|volume=16|issue=1|doi=10.1023/A:1022958406273|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]] argues that among developed countries, those with high rates of taxation and high social welfare spending perform better on most measures of economic performance compared to countries with low rates of taxation and low social outlays. He concludes that Friedrich Hayek was wrong to argue that high levels of government spending harms an economy, and &quot;a generous social-welfare state is not a road to serfdom but rather to fairness, economic equality and international competitiveness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Social Welfare State, Beyond Ideology |last=Sachs|first=Jeffrey |date = October 2006|journal=Scientific American |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-social-welfare-state |accessdate=2008-06-20|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian economist [[Sudha Shenoy]] responded by arguing that countries with large public sectors have grown more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;Sudha R. Shenoy, ''Are High Taxes the Basis of Freedom and Prosperity?'', https://fee.org/articles/are-high-taxes-the-basis-of-freedom-and-prosperity/&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist Bryan Caplan has noted that Mises has been criticized for overstating the strength of his case in describing socialism as ''impossible'' rather than as something that would need to establish non-market institutions to deal with the inefficiency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caplan_soc&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caplan |first1=Bryan |title=Is socialism really &quot;impossible&quot;? |journal=Critical Review |volume=16 |pages=33–52 |year=2004 |doi=10.1080/08913810408443598 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodology===
Critics generally argue that Austrian economics lacks scientific rigor and rejects scientific methods and the use of empirical data in modelling economic behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;lwhite&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The research program of Austrian economics |publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited |first=Lawrence H. |last=White |journal=Advances in Austrian Economics |year=2008 |page=20 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton1999&quot;&gt;&quot;Rules for the study of [[natural philosophy]]&quot;, {{harvnb |Newton |1999 |pp=794–96 }}, from Book '''3''', ''The System of the World''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some economists describe Austrian methodology as being ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' or [[empirical|non-empirical]].&lt;ref name=&quot;white1&quot;&gt;

Economist [[Mark Blaug]] has criticized over-reliance on methodological individualism, arguing it would rule out all macroeconomic propositions that cannot be reduced to microeconomic ones, and hence reject almost the whole of received macroeconomics.&lt;ref name=Blaug&gt;{{Cite book|last=Blaug|first=Mark|title=The Methodology of Economics: Or, How Economists Explain|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-43678-8|pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Thomas Mayer (American economist)|Thomas Mayer]] has stated that Austrians advocate a rejection of the [[scientific method]] which involves the development of empirically falsifiable [[Scientific theory#Pedagogical definition|theories]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton1999&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayer1998&quot; /&gt; Furthermore, many supporters of using models of market behavior to analyze and test economic theory argue that economists have developed numerous experiments that elicit useful information about individual preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_M000391 |title=Models |first=Mary S. |last=Morgan |work=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics  |year=2008 |accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_C000569 |title=Causality in economics and econometrics |first=Kevin D.  |last=Hoover |work=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics  |year=2008 |accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although economist Leland Yeager is sympathetic to Austrian economics, he rejects many favorite views of the Misesian group of Austrians, in particular, &quot;the specifics of their business-cycle theory, ultra-subjectivism in value theory and particularly in interest-rate theory, their insistence on unidirectional causality rather than general interdependence, and their fondness for methodological brooding, pointless profundities, and verbal gymnastics.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yeager|first1=Leland B|title=Austrian Economics, Neoclassicism, and the Market Test|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|date=1997|volume=11|issue=4|pages=153–65|jstor=2138469|doi=10.1257/jep.11.4.153|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Paul A.

===Business cycle theory===
Mainstream economic research regarding [[Austrian business cycle theory]] finds that it is inconsistent with empirical evidence.

Austrian economist Ludwig Lachmann noted that the Austrian theory was rejected during the 1930s:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The promise of an Austrian theory of the trade cycle, which might also serve to explain the severity of the Great Depression, a feature of the early 1930s that provided the background for Hayek’s successful appearance on the London scene, soon proved deceptive. Three giants – Keynes, Knight and Sraffa – turned against the hapless Austrians who, in the middle of that black decade, thus had to do battle on three fronts. Naturally it proved a task beyond their strength.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig M. Lachmann, in The Market as an Economic Process (Oxford, 1986), p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some economists argue that Austrian business cycle theory requires bankers and investors to exhibit a kind of irrationality, because the Austrian theory posits that investors will be fooled repeatedly (by temporarily low interest rates) into making unprofitable investment decisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tullock1988&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reasonpapers.com/pdf/05/rp_5_4.pdf Problems with Austrian Business Cycle Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan Caplan writes: &quot;Why does Rothbard think businessmen are so incompetent at forecasting government policy? He credits them with entrepreneurial foresight about all market-generated conditions, but curiously finds them unable to forecast government policy, or even to avoid falling prey to simple accounting illusions generated by inflation and deflation.

Milton Friedman objected to the policy implications of the theory, stating the following in a 1998 interview:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think the Austrian business-cycle theory has done the world a great deal of harm. If you go back to the 1930s, which is a key point, here you had the Austrians sitting in London, Hayek and Lionel Robbins, and saying you just have to let the bottom drop out of the world. You’ve just got to let it cure itself. You can’t do anything about it. You will only make it worse. You have Rothbard saying it was a great mistake not to let the whole banking system collapse. I think by encouraging that kind of do-nothing policy both in Britain and in the United States, they did harm.&lt;ref&gt;Interview in ''Barron's Magazine'', August 24, 1998 archived at Hoover Institution [http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/6459]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Empirical objections====
In 1969, Milton Friedman, after examining the history of business cycles in the U.S., concluded that &quot;The Hayek-Mises explanation of the business cycle is contradicted by the evidence. It is, I believe, false.&quot;&lt;ref name=Friedman1969/&gt; He analyzed the issue using newer data in 1993, and again reached the same conclusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman93&quot;/&gt; Referring to Friedman's discussion of the business cycle, Austrian economist Roger Garrison argued that Friedman's empirical findings are &quot;broadly consistent with both Monetarist and Austrian views&quot;, and goes on to argue that although Friedman's model &quot;describes the economy's performance at the highest level of aggregation; Austrian theory offers an insightful account of the market process that might underlie those aggregates.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Auburn User |url=http://www.auburn.edu/~garriro/fm1pluck.htm |title=Plucking Model |publisher=Auburn.edu |date=1982-10-25 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
