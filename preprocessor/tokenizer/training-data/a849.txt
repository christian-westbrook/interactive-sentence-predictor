'''Anah''' or '''Ana''' ({{lang-ar|عانة}}, ''ʾĀna''), formerly also known as '''Anna''',{{sfnp|EB|1878}} is an [[Iraq]]i town on the [[Euphrates]] river, approximately midway between the [[Gulf of Alexandretta]] and the [[Persian Gulf]]. Anah lies from west to east on the right bank along a bend of the river just before it turns south towards [[Hīt|Hit]].

{{anchor|Etymology}}

==Name==
The town is called '''Ha-na-at{{sup|K1}}''' in a [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]] letter around 2200&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}},{{sfnp|Hogg|1911}} '''A-na-at''' by the scribes of [[Tukulti-Ninurta II|Tukulti-Ninurta]] {{c.|lk=no|885}}&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}},{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} and '''An-at''' by the scribes of [[Assur-nasir-pal II]] in 879&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}.{{sfnp|Hogg|1911}} The name has been connected with the widely worshipped war goddess [[Anat]].{{sfnp|Hogg|1911}} It was known as ''Anathō'' ({{lang-grc-gre|Άναθω}}) to [[Isidore Charax]] and ''{{lang|la|Anatha}}'' to [[Ammianus Marcellinus]]; early Arabic writers described it variously as ''ʾĀna'' or (as if plural) ''ʾĀnāt''.{{sfnp|Hogg|1911}}

==History==

===Ancient===
Despite maintaining its name across 42 centuries, the exact location of the settlement seems to have moved from time to time. Sources across most of its early history, however, place Anah on an island in the Euphrates.{{refn|group=n|Viz., [[Tukulti-Ninurta II]], [[Ashur-nasir-pal II]], [[Isidore of Seville|Isidore]], [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]], [[Ibn Serapion]], [[al-Istakri]], [[Abulfeda]], and [[al-Karamani]].{{sfnp|Hogg|1911}}}}

Its early history under the Babylonians is uncertain. A 3rd-millennium&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} letter mentions six &quot;men of Hanat&quot; are mentioned in a description of disturbances in the Residency of Suhi, which would have included the district of Anah.{{sfnp|Hogg|1911}} It is probably not the place mentioned by [[Amenhotep I]] in the 16th century&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} or in the speech of [[Sennacherib]]'s messengers to [[Hezekiah]],&lt;ref&gt;2 Kings xix. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Is. xxxvii. 13&lt;/ref&gt; but probably was the site &quot;in the middle of the Euphrates&quot; opposite which Assur-nasir-pal II halted during his 879&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} campaign.{{sfnp|Hogg|1911}} It may also be mentioned in four 7th-century&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} documents edited by [[Claude Hermann Walter Johns]].&lt;ref&gt;Ass. Deeds and Doc. nos. 23, 168, 228, 385.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|The characters used are {{sc|dis tu}}, which may mean Ana-tu.{{sfnp|Hogg|1911}}}}

[[Xenophon]] records that the army of Cyrus resupplied during a campaign in 401&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} at &quot;Charmande&quot; near the end of a 90-[[parasang]] march between [[Korsote]] and [[Pylae]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''Anabasis''.&lt;/ref&gt; which likely intends Anah. It was the site where [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] first met opposition in his {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;363 expedition against [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]]. He got possession of the place and relocated its inhabitants.{{sfnp|Hogg|1911}}

===Medieval===
In 657, during the [[Muslim conquest of Iraq]], [[Ali]]'s lieutenants Ziyad and [[Shureih]] were refused passage across the Euphrates at Anah.&lt;ref&gt;Tabari I. 3261.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1058, Anah was the place of exile of the caliph [[Al-Qa'im (caliph)|Qaim]] when [[al-Basasiri]] was in power.{{sfnp|Hogg|1911}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;&gt;Longrigg, p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 14th century, Anah was the seat of the [[catholicos]] who served as [[primate (bishop)|primate]] over the Persian Christians.{{sfnp|Hogg|1911}} Throughout early Islamic rule, it was a prosperous trade town, well known for its date palms and gardens;&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt; in the 14th century, Mustafi wrote of the fame of its palm groves. Medieval [[Arabic poetry|Arab poets]] celebrated Anah's wine;&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yaqut, iii. 593f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 14th and 17th centuries, Anah served as a headquarters for a host of regional [[Arab]] tribes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt; In 1574, [[Leonhart Rauwolff]] found the town divided into two parts, the Turkish &quot;so surrounded by the river that you cannot go into it but by boats&quot; and the larger Arabian section along one of the banks. In 1610, [[Texeira]]&lt;!-- links to dab page, but this particular Texeira seems not to be described in WP --&gt; said Anah lay on both banks of the river, with which [[Pietro Della Valle]] agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Della Valle, i. 671.&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, Della Valle found the Scot George Strachan resident at Anah, working as the physician to the emir and studying Arabic;&lt;ref&gt;Della Valle, i. 671-681.&lt;/ref&gt; he also found some sun worshipers still living there. Della Valle and Texeira called Anah the principal Arab town on the Euphrates, controlling a major route west from [[Baghdad]] and territory reaching [[Palmyra]].{{sfnp|Hogg|1911}}

====Late Ottoman era====
About 1750, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s installed a rudimentary administration to run Anah and its district.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt; After roughly a century, a more organized local government was put in place, whereby Anah became the center of a [[kaza]] belonging to the [[Baghdad Vilayet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt;

At the beginning of the 19th century, [[G.A. Olivier]] found only 25 men in service of the local prince, with residents fleeing daily to escape from [[bedouin]] attacks against which he offered no protection.{{sfnp|Olivier|1807}} He described the city as a single long street of five or six miles along a narrow strip of land between the river and a ridge of rocky hills.{{sfnp|Olivier|1807|p=451}} [[W. F. Ainsworth]], chronicling the [[English Euphrates expedition]], reported that in 1835 the Arabs inhabited the northwest part of the town, the Christians the center, and the Jews the southeast.{{sfnp|Ainsworth|1888}} The same year, the steamer ''Tigris'' went down in a storm just above Anah, near where Julian's force had suffered from a similar storm.{{sfnp|Hogg|1911}}

By the mid-19th century, the houses were separated from one another by fruit gardens, which also filled the riverine islands near the town.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} The most easterly island contained a ruined castle, while the ruins of ancient Anatho extended a further 2 miles along the left bank.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} It marked the boundary between the olive (north) and date (south) growing regions in the area.{{sfnp|Hogg|1911}} With the positioning of Turkish troops in the town around 1890, the locals no longer had to pay blackmail (''huwwa'') to the bedouins.&lt;ref&gt;Von Oppenheim, 1893.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the early 20th century, coarse cotton cloth was the only manufacture.{{sfnp|EB|1878}}{{sfnp|Hogg|1911}} In 1909 Anah had an estimated population of 15,000 and 2,000 houses.&lt;ref name=&quot;MesoHandBook&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=A Handbook of Mesopotamia, Volume III: Central Mesopotamia with Southern Kurdistan and the Syrian Desert|date=January 1917|publisher=Admirality and War Office, Division of Intelligence|pages=351–352|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the inhabitants were [[Sunni Muslim]] Arabs, though a small Jewish community lived in the town's southern edge.&lt;ref name=&quot;MesoHandBook&quot;/&gt;

===Kingdom of Iraq===
In 1918, the town was captured by British forces and by 1921, became incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Iraq]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt; It remained an administrative center of a [[qadaa]], part of the larger [[Ramadi]]-based [[Sanjak|liwa]] of Dulaym. Anah's ''qadaa'' also included the subdistricts of [[Hīt]], [[al-Qa'im (town)|al-Qa'im]] and Jubba.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt; The townspeople's long feud with the inhabitants of [[Rawa, Iraq|Rawa]] was settled diplomatically by 1921.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt; Its territory to the west was dominated by the subtribes of [[Anizzah]], while to the east the Jarba branch of the [[Shammar]] held sway.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt;

Most of Anah's building were located among a dense belt of date palms and was &quot;reckoned as healthy and picturesque&quot;, according to historian S. H. Longrigg.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt; The date palms were irrigated by [[na'ura|water wheel]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt; There were also more scattered dwelling in the mid-stream islands of the Euphrates near the town center.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt; The women of the town were well known for their beauty and the weaving of cotton and wool textiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt; The men, many of whom were compelled to emigrate to lack of living space, were largely engaged as boatmen and transporters of water to Baghdad. The town had relatively high educational standards, with eight schools built there by 1946.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longrigg461&quot;/&gt;

[[F. R. Chesney]] reported about 1800 houses, 2 [[mosque]]s, and 16 waterwheels. One minaret is particularly old. [[Alastair Northedge|Northedge]] reported the locals commonly attributed it to the 11th century but opined that it was more likely from about a century after that. It rose from one of the islands and belonged to the local mosque. Dr. Muayad Said described it as an octagonal body &quot;enhanced by alcoves, some of which are blind&quot; and noted earlier conservation work undertaken in 1935, 1963 and 1964. When the valley was flooded by the [[Haditha Dam]] in 1984 and '85, the Iraqi State Board of Antiquities cut it into sections and removed it to the new Anah, where it was re-erected to a height of {{convert|28|m|sp=us}} at the end of the 1980s.

[[Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] captured the town in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alissa J. Rubin]] (22 June 2014). [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/23/world/middleeast/iraq.html Sunni Militants Capture Iraq’s Last Major Border Post With Syria] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
In September, 2017, the town was recaptured by the Iraqi army.
