'''Alexander of Aphrodisias''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ Ἀφροδισιεύς}}; fl. 200 AD) was a [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] philosopher and the most celebrated of the [[Ancient Greek]] [[Commentaries on Aristotle|commentators]] on the writings of [[Aristotle]]. He was a native of [[Aphrodisias]] in [[Caria]], and lived and taught in [[Athens]] at the beginning of the 3rd century, where he held a position as head of the [[Peripatetic school]]. He wrote many commentaries on the works of [[Aristotle]], extant are those on the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', ''[[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]]'', ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]'', ''[[Sense and Sensibilia (Aristotle)|Sense and Sensibilia]]'', and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]''. Several original treatises also survive, and include a work ''On Fate'', in which he argues against the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] doctrine of necessity; and one ''On the Soul''. His commentaries on Aristotle were considered so useful that he was styled, by way of pre-eminence, &quot;the commentator&quot; ({{lang|grc|ὁ ἐξηγητής}}).

==Life and career==
Alexander was a native of [[Aphrodisias]] in [[Caria]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaniotis&quot;&gt;A. Chaniotis, 'Epigraphic evidence for the philosopher Alexander of Aphrodisias', in ''Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies'', {{ISSN|0076-0730}}, v.47 (2004) pp. 79-81&lt;/ref&gt; and came to [[Athens]] towards the end of the 2nd century.  He was a student of the two [[Stoicism|Stoic]],&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Lynch, ''Aristotle's School'', Berkeley, 1972, p. 215.  See [[Sosigenes the Peripatetic]].&lt;/ref&gt; or possibly [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]], philosophers [[Sosigenes the Peripatetic|Sosigenes]]&lt;ref&gt;See Alexander's Comm. in Arist. ''Meteor.'', p. 143.13 Hayduck ({{lang|grc|ὁ διδάσκαλος ἡμῶν Σωσιγένης}}), [[Themistius]], Paraphr. in Arist. ''de Anima'', p. 61.23 Heinze, Ps.-Ammonius, Comm. in Arist. ''Anal. Pr.'' p. 39.24 Wallies, and [[Philoponus]], Comm. in Arist. ''Anal. Pr.'', p. 126.20-23 Wallies.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Herminus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], Comm. in Arist. ''de Caelo'', p. 430.32 Heiberg, quoting Alexander: {{lang|grc|Ἑρμίνου δέ...ἤκουσα, καθὰ ἦν καὶ ἐν τοῖς Ἀσπασίου φερόμενον}}, &quot;I heard from Herminus, as was said among Aspasius' students...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps of [[Aristotle of Mytilene]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Thillet, in his 1984 [[Collection Budé|Budé]] edition of ''On Fate'', has argued against Moraux's identification (''Der Aristotelismus im I. und II. Jahrhundert n. Chr.'', vol. 2, 1984) of Aristotle of Mytilene as Alexander's teacher, pointing out that the text that has been taken to mean this (''On Fate'', ''mantissa'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=bKYNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA110 p. 110.4 Bruns], {{lang|grc|Ἤκουσα...παρὰ Ἀριστοτέλους}}) could refer instead to Alexander's learning from the texts of Aristotle the Stagirite.  See R.W. Sharples, ''Classical Review'', n.s., 36 (1986), [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3064220 p. 33]. [[Cyril of Alexandria]], ''Against Julian'' 2.38, may name [[Aristocles of Messene]], but the text edited by Burguière and Évieux (''[[Sources Chrétiennes]]'' 322, 1985) reads {{lang|grc|Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ Ἀριστοτέλους μαθητὴς}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At Athens he became head of the [[Peripatetic school]] and lectured on Peripatetic philosophy.  Alexander's dedication of ''On Fate'' to [[Septimius Severus]] and [[Caracalla]], in gratitude for his position at Athens, indicates a date between 198 and 209.  A recently published inscription from Aphrodisias confirms that he was head of one of the Schools at Athens and gives his full name as Titus Aurelius Alexander.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaniotis&quot;/&gt; His full nomenclature shows that his grandfather or other ancestor was probably given Roman citizenship by the emperor [[Antoninus Pius]], while proconsul of Asia.  The inscription honours his father, also called Alexander and also a philosopher.  This fact makes it plausible that some of the suspect works that form part of Alexander's corpus should be ascribed to his father.&lt;ref&gt;R. Sharples, 'Implications of the new Alexander of Aphrodisias inscription', in ''Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies '' 48 (2005) pp. 47-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentaries===
[[File:Alexander - Commentaria in Analytica priora Aristotelis, 1549 - 4725692.tif |thumb|''Commentaria in Analytica priora Aristotelis'', 1549]]
[[File:Andrea briosco, aristotele e alessandro di afrodisia.JPG|thumb|[[Andrea Briosco]], ''Aristotle and Alexander of Aphrodisias'', 16th century [[plaquette]], [[Bode Museum|Bode-Museum]]]]
Alexander composed several [[Commentaries on Aristotle|commentaries on the works of Aristotle]], in which he sought to escape a [[Syncretism|syncretistic]] tendency and to recover the pure doctrines of Aristotle.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Alexander of Aphrodisias|inline=1|volume=1|page=566}}&lt;/ref&gt; His extant commentaries are on ''[[Prior Analytics]]'' (Book 1), ''[[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]]'', ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]'', ''[[Sense and Sensibilia (Aristotle)|Sense and Sensibilia]]'', and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' (Books 1-5).&lt;ref name=&quot;zeyl&quot;&gt;Donald J. Zeyl, Daniel Devereux, Phillip Mitsis, (1997), ''Encyclopedia of Classical Philosophy'', page 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The commentary on the ''[[Sophistical Refutations]]'' is deemed spurious, as is the commentary on the final nine books of the ''Metaphysics''.&lt;ref name=&quot;fortenbaugh22&quot;&gt;William W. Fortenbaugh, R. W. Sharples, (2005), ''Theophrastus of Eresus, sources for his life, writings, thought and Influence'', page 22. BRILL&lt;/ref&gt; The lost commentaries include works on the ''[[De Interpretatione]]'', ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'', ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', ''[[On the Heavens]]'', ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'', ''[[On the Soul]]'', and ''[[On Memory]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;fortenbaugh22&quot;/&gt; [[Simplicius of Cilicia]] mentions that Alexander provided commentary on the [[quadrature of the lune]]s, and the corresponding problem of [[squaring the circle]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunham, William. ''Journey through Genius'', Penguin, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2007, it was reported that imaging analysis had discovered an early commentary on Aristotle's ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'' in the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]], and [[Robert Sharples (classicist)|Robert Sharples]] suggested Alexander as the most likely author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6591221.stm | work=BBC News | title=Text reveals more ancient secrets | date=2007-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original treatises===
There are also several extant original writings by Alexander. These include: ''On the Soul'', ''Problems and Solutions'', ''Ethical Problems'', ''On Fate'', and ''On Mixture and Growth''.&lt;ref name=&quot;zeyl&quot;/&gt; Three works attributed to him are considered spurious: ''Medical Questions'', ''Physical Problems'', and ''On Fevers''.&lt;ref name=&quot;zeyl&quot;/&gt; Additional works by Alexander are preserved in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translation, these include: ''On the Principles of the Universe'',&lt;ref&gt;Charles Genequand, (2001), ''Alexander of Aphrodisias: On the Cosmos''. BRILL&lt;/ref&gt; ''On Providence'', and ''Against [[Galen]] on Motion''.&lt;ref&gt;N. Rescher, M. E. Marmura, (1965), ''The Refutation by Alexander of Aphrodisias of Galen's Treatise on the Theory of Motion''. Islamic Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

''On the Soul'' (''De anima'') is a treatise on the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] written along the lines suggested by Aristotle in his own ''[[On the Soul|De anima]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Van Riel, 2010, ''Ancient Perspectives on Aristotle's de Anima'', page 174. Leuven University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander contends that the undeveloped reason in man is material (''nous hylikos'') and inseparable from the body.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot;/&gt; He argued strongly against the doctrine of the soul's immortality.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot;/&gt; He identified the active intellect (''nous poietikos''), through whose agency the potential intellect in man becomes actual, with [[God]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot;/&gt; A second book is known as the ''Supplement to On the Soul'' (''Mantissa''). The ''Mantissa'' is a series of twenty-five separate pieces of which the opening five deal directly with [[psychology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;todd18&quot;&gt;Robert B. Todd, (1976), ''Alexander of Aphrodisias on Stoic physics: a study of the De Mixtione with Preliminary Essays, Text, Translation and Commentary'', page 18. BRILL&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining twenty pieces cover problems in [[physics]] and [[ethics]], of which the largest group deals with questions of [[visual perception|vision]] and [[light]], and the final four with [[destiny|fate]] and [[Divine Providence|providence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;todd18&quot;/&gt; The ''Mantissa'' was probably not written by Alexander in its current form, but much of the actual material may be his.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The two books of the ''De Anima'' differ markedly in form and content, and they were not originally a single work. Book I is generally recognized as authentic. Book II is almost certainly not by Alexander of Aphrodisias in its present form, though much of the material may be his or from his school.&quot; {{cite journal|last1=Cranz|first1=F. Edward|title=Alexander Aphrodisiensis|journal=[[Catalogus Translationum et Commentariorum]]|date=1960|volume=1|page=84|url=http://catalogustranslationum.org/PDFs/volume01/v01_alexander.pdf|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Problems and Solutions'' (''Quaestiones'') consists of three books which, although termed &quot;problems and solutions of physical questions,&quot; treat of subjects which are not all physical, and are not all problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;todd19&quot;&gt;Robert B. Todd, (1976), ''Alexander of Aphrodisias on Stoic physics: a study of the De Mixtione with Preliminary Essays, Text, Translation and Commentary'', page 19. BRILL&lt;/ref&gt; Among the sixty-nine items in these three books, twenty-four deal with physics, seventeen with psychology, eleven with [[logic]] and [[metaphysics]], and six with questions of fate and providence.&lt;ref name=&quot;todd19&quot;/&gt; It is unlikely that Alexander wrote all of the ''Quaestiones'', some may be Alexander's own explanations, while others may be exercises by his students.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Sharples, 1992, ''Alexander of Aphrodisias: Quaestiones 1.1-2.15'', pages 3-4. Duckworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ethical Problems'' was traditionally counted as the fourth book of the ''Quaestiones''.&lt;ref name=&quot;todd19&quot;/&gt; The work is a discussion of ethical issues based on Aristotle, and contains responses to questions and problems deriving from Alexander's school.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuominen&quot;&gt;Miira Tuominen, (2009), ''The ancient commentators on Plato and Aristotle'', page 237. University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that the work was not written by Alexander himself, but rather by his pupils on the basis of debates involving Alexander.&lt;ref name=&quot;tuominen&quot;/&gt;

''On Fate'' is a treatise in which Alexander argues against the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] doctrine of necessity.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot;/&gt; In ''On Fate'' Alexander denied three things - necessity ({{lang-el|ἀνάγκη}}), the foreknowledge of fated events that was part of the Stoic identification of God and Nature, and [[determinism]] in the sense of a sequence of causes that was laid down beforehand ({{lang-el|προκαταβεβλημένα αἴτια}}) or predetermined by antecedents ({{lang-el|προηγούμενα αἴτια}}). He defended a view of moral responsibility we would call [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarianism]] today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/philosophers/alexander/ Alexander of Aphrodisias]&lt;/ref&gt;

''On Mixture and Growth'' discusses the topic of [[mixture]] of physical bodies.&lt;ref name=&quot;toddix&quot;&gt;Robert B. Todd, (1976), ''Alexander of Aphrodisias on Stoic physics: a study of the De Mixtione with Preliminary Essays, Text, Translation and Commentary'', page ix. BRILL&lt;/ref&gt; It is both an extended discussion (and polemic) on [[Stoic physics]], and an exposition of Aristotelian thought on this theme.&lt;ref name=&quot;toddix&quot;/&gt;

''On the Principles of the Universe'' is preserved in Arabic translation. This treatise is not mentioned in surviving Greek sources, but it enjoyed great popularity in the Muslim world, and a large number of copies have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Genequand, (2001), ''Alexander of Aphrodisias: On the Cosmos'', page 1. BRILL&lt;/ref&gt; The main purpose of this work is to give a general account of Aristotelian cosmology and metaphysics, but it also has a polemical tone, and it may be directed at rival views within the Peripatetic school.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Genequand, (2001), ''Alexander of Aphrodisias: On the Cosmos'', page 4. BRILL&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander was concerned with filling the gaps of the Aristotelian system and smoothing out its inconsistencies, while also presenting a unified picture of the world, both physical and ethical.&lt;ref name=&quot;genequand6&quot;&gt;Charles Genequand, (2001), ''Alexander of Aphrodisias: On the Cosmos'', page 6. BRILL&lt;/ref&gt; The topics dealt with are the nature of the heavenly motions and the relationship between the unchangeable celestial realm and the [[Sublunary sphere|sublunar world]] of generation and decay.&lt;ref name=&quot;genequand6&quot;/&gt; His principal sources are the ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' (book 7), ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' (book 12), and the [[Pseudo-Aristotle|Pseudo-Aristotelian]] ''[[On the Universe]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;genequand6&quot;/&gt;

''On Providence'' survives in two Arabic versions.&lt;ref name=&quot;sharples&quot;&gt;Robert W. Sharples, &quot;The Peripatetic school&quot;, in David Furley (editor), (2003), ''From Aristotle to Augustine'', pages 159-160. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; In this treatise, Alexander opposes the Stoic view that [[divine Providence]] extends to all aspects of the world; he regards this idea as unworthy of the gods.&lt;ref name=&quot;sharples&quot;/&gt; Instead, providence is a power that emanates from the heavens to the sublunar region, and is responsible for the generation and destruction of earthly things, without any direct involvement in the lives of individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;sharples&quot;/&gt;

==Influence==
By the 6th century Alexander's commentaries on Aristotle were considered so useful that he was referred to as &quot;the commentator&quot; ({{lang-el|ὁ ἐξηγητής}}).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], ''in Phys.'' 707, 33; 1170, 13; 1176, 32; [[John Philoponus|Philoponus]], ''in An. Pr.'' 126, 21; [[Olympiodorus the Younger|Olympiodorus]], ''in Meteor.'' 263, 21. But see [[Jonathan Barnes]] et al., (1991), ''Alexander of Aphrodisias, On Aristotle Prior Analytics 1.1-7'', page 4, who argue: &quot;In all these texts Alexander is indeed referred to by phrases such as 'the commentator' or 'Aristotle's commentator'; but these phrases are not honorific titles - they are ordinary referring expressions. If, at the end of a book review, you read 'The author deserves our thanks', you will rightly take this for praise - but you will not think that the author has been honoured as The Author par excellence.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; His commentaries were greatly esteemed among the [[Arab]]s, who translated many of them,&lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot;/&gt; and he is heavily quoted by [[Maimonides]].

In 1210, the Church Council of Paris issued [[Condemnations (University of Paris)#Condemnation of 1210|a condemnation]], which probably targeted the writings of Alexander among others.&lt;ref&gt;G. Théry, ''Autour du décret de 1210: II, Alexandre d'Aphrodise. Aperçu sur l'influence de sa noétique'', Kain, Belgium, 1926, pp. 7 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early [[Renaissance]] his doctrine of the soul's mortality was adopted by [[Pietro Pomponazzi]] (against the [[Thomists]] and the [[Averroists]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot;/&gt; and by his successor [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]].  This school is known as [[Alexandrists]].

[[Alexander's band]], an [[optical phenomenon]], is named after him.

==Modern editions==
Several of Alexander's works were published in the [[Aldine Press|Aldine]] edition of Aristotle, Venice, 1495–1498; his ''De Fato'' and ''De Anima'' were printed along with the works of [[Themistius]] at Venice (1534); the former work, which has been translated into [[Latin]] by [[Grotius]] and also by [[Schulthess]], was edited by [[Johann Caspar von Orelli|J. C. Orelli]], [[Zürich]], 1824; and his commentaries on the Metaphysica by [[H. Bonitz]], [[Berlin]], 1847.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot;/&gt; In 1989 the first part of his ''On Aristotle Metaphysics'' was published as part of the [[Ancient commentators project]]. Since then, other works of his have been translated into English.
