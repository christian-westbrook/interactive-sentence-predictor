'''Abydos''' ({{lang-grc|Ἄβῡδος}}) or '''Abydus''', was an ancient city and bishopric in [[Mysia]] in [[Asia Minor]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; It was located on the coast of the [[Dardanelles|Hellespont]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Foss&quot;&gt;Foss (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greek mythology, Abydos is presented in the myth of [[Hero and Leander]] as the home of Leander.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkinson (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The city is also mentioned in ''Rodanthe and Dosikles'', a novel written by [[Theodore Prodromos]], a 12th century writer, in which Dosikles kidnaps Rodanthe at Abydos.&lt;ref&gt;Kazhdan &amp; Wharton (1985), p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Classical period===
Abydos is mentioned in the [[Iliad]] as a [[Troy|Trojan]] ally,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell&quot;&gt;Mitchell (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to [[Strabo]], was occupied by [[Thrace|Thracians]] after the [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bean&quot;&gt;Bean (1976), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Abydos was settled by [[Miletus|Milesian]] colonists contemporaneously with the foundation of the cities of [[Karabiga|Priapos]] and [[Marmara Island|Prokonnesos]] in c. 670 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen &amp; Nielsen (2004), p. 993&lt;/ref&gt;  Strabo related that [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]], King of [[Lydia]] granted his consent to the Milesians to settle Abydos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bean&quot;/&gt; Abydos was ruled by Daphnis, a pro-Persian tyrant, in the 520s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hansen1003&quot;&gt;Hansen &amp; Nielsen (2004), p. 1003&lt;/ref&gt; but was occupied by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] in 514.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell&quot;/&gt; [[Darius I]] destroyed the city following his [[European Scythian campaign of Darius I|Scythian campaign]] in 512.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hansen1003&quot;/&gt; In 480, at the onset of the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece]], [[Xerxes I]] and the Persian army passed through Abydos on its march to Greece.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell&quot;/&gt;

After the failed Persian invasion, Abydos became a member of the [[Delian League]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell&quot;/&gt; and was part of the [[Members of the Delian League#Hellespontine phoros|Hellespontine district]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hansen1003&quot;/&gt; Ostensibly an ally, Abydos was hostile to Athens throughout this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bean&quot;/&gt; During the [[Second Peloponnesian War]], a Spartan expedition led by [[Dercylidas]] arrived at Abydos in early May 411 and successfully convinced the city to defect from the Delian League and fight against Athens,&lt;ref&gt;Kagan (2013), p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; at which time he was made ''[[harmost]]'' (commander/governor) of Abydos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodkinson &quot;&gt;Hodkinson (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Abydos was attacked by the Athenians in the winter of 409/408 BC, but was repelled by a Persian force led by [[Pharnabazus II|Pharnabazus]], ''[[satrap]]'' (governor) of [[Hellespontine Phrygia]].&lt;ref&gt;Kagan (2013), p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; Dercylidas held the office of ''harmost'' of Abydos until at least c. 407.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodkinson &quot; /&gt;

According to [[Aristotle]], Abydos held an oligarchic constitution at this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hansen1003&quot;/&gt; At the beginning of the [[Corinthian War]] in 394 BC, [[Agesilaus II|Agesilaus]], King of [[Sparta]], passed through Abydos into Thrace.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phang&quot;/&gt; Abydos remained an ally of Sparta throughout the war and Dercylidas served as ''harmost'' of the city from 394 until he was replaced by [[Anaxibius]] in c. 390, who was killed in an ambush near Abydos by the Athenian general [[Iphicrates]] in c. 389/388.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phang&quot;&gt;Phang et al. (2016), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of the Corinthian War, under the terms of the [[Peace of Antalcidas]] in 387 BC, Abydos was annexed to the Persian Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bean&quot;/&gt;

In c. 360, the city came under the control of the tyrant Iphiades.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hansen1003&quot;/&gt; Abydos remained under Persian control until it was seized by a Macedonian army led by [[Parmenion]], a general of [[Alexander the Great]], in the spring of 336 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashley&quot;&gt;Ashley (2004), p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; In 335, whilst Parmenion besieged the city of [[Pitane (Aeolis)|Pitane]], Abydos was besieged by a Persian army led by [[Memnon of Rhodes]], forcing Parmenion to abandon his siege of Pitane and march north to relieve Abydos.&lt;ref&gt;Freely (2010), pp. 55-56&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander ferried across from Sestos to Abydos in 334 and travelled south to the city of Troy, after which he returned to Abydos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashley&quot; /&gt; The following day, Alexander left Abydos and led his army north to [[Percote]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashley&quot; /&gt; Alexander later established a royal mint at Abydos, as well as at other cities in Asia Minor.&lt;ref&gt;Dmitriev (2011), p. 429&lt;/ref&gt;

In 302, during the [[Wars of the Diadochi#Fourth War of the Diadochi|Fourth War of the Diadochi]], [[Lysimachus]], King of Thrace, crossed over into Anatolia and invaded the Kingdom of [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus I]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Magie89&quot;&gt;Magie (2015), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the neighbouring cities of [[Parium]] and [[Lampsacus]] which surrendered, Abydos resisted Lysimachus and was besieged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Magie89&quot; /&gt; Lysimachus was forced to abandon the siege, however, after the arrival of a relief force sent by [[Demetrius I of Macedon|Demetrius]], son of King Antigonus I.&lt;ref name=&quot;Magie89&quot; /&gt;

During the [[Second Macedonian War]], Abydos was besieged by [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]], King of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], in 200 BC,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques&quot;&gt;Jaques (2007), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; during which many of its citizens chose to commit suicide rather than surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Magie (2015), pp. 15-16&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the city was forced to surrender to Philip V due to a lack of reinforcements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques&quot;/&gt; The Macedonian occupation ended after the Peace of Flamininus at the end of the war in 196 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques&quot;/&gt; At this time, Abydos was substantially depopulated and partially ruined as a result of the Macedonian occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Grainger (2002), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 196 BC, Abydos was seized by [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus III]], ''[[Basileus|Megas Basileus]]'' of the [[Seleucid Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;Magie (2015), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; who refortified the city in 192/191 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phang&quot;/&gt;

Under the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]], the city was administered by an ''komes ton Stenon'' (count of the straits) or an ''[[archon#Byzantine Empire|archon]]'', and was the centre for customs collection at the southern entrance of the [[Sea of Marmara]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Foss&quot;/&gt; In the 6th century AD, Emperor [[Justinian I]] introduced the office of ''komes'' with responsibility for collecting customs duty in Abydos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foss&quot;/&gt;

===Medieval period===
As a result of the administrative reforms of the 7th century, Abydos came to be administered as part of the [[Theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] of [[Opsikion]].&lt;ref&gt;Lampakis (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The office of ''[[kommerkiarios]]'' of Abydos is first attested in the mid-7th century, and was later sometimes combined with the office of ''[[paraphylax]]'', the military governor of the fort, introduced in the 8th century, at which time the office of ''komes ton stenon'' is last mentioned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nesbitt &quot;&gt;Nesbitt &amp; Oikonomides (1996), pp. 73-74&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 7th century AD, Abydos became a major seaport.&lt;ref&gt;Kazhdan (1991a)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik]], during his campaign against Constantinople, crossed over into Thrace at Abydos in July 717.&lt;ref&gt;Venning &amp; Harris (2006), p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; In 801, Empress [[Irene of Athens|Irene]] reduced commercial tariffs collected at Abydos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foss&quot;/&gt; Emperor [[Nikephoros I]], Irene's successor, introduced a tax on slaves purchased beyond the city.&lt;ref&gt;Hollingsworth (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; The city later also became part of the theme of the [[Aegean Sea (theme)|Aegean Sea]] and was the seat of a ''[[Turma|tourmarches]]'' (commander of a tourma).&lt;ref name=&quot;Nesbitt &quot;/&gt; In the early 11th century, Abydos became the seat of a separate command and the office of ''[[strategos]]'' (governor) of Abydos is first mentioned in 1004 with authority over the northern shore of the Hellespont and the islands of the Sea of Marmara.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nesbitt &quot;/&gt;

Abydos was sacked by an [[Abbasid Caliphate|Arab]] fleet led by [[Leo of Tripoli]] in 904 AD whilst en route to Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;Kazhdan (1991b)&lt;/ref&gt; The revolt of [[Bardas Phokas the Younger|Bardas Phokas]] was defeated by Emperor [[Basil II]] at the Battle of Abydos in 989 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Evans &amp; Wixom (1997), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; In 992, Venetians were granted reduced commercial tariffs at Abydos as a special privilege.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foss&quot;/&gt; In 1024, a [[Rus' people|Rus']] raid led by a certain [[Battle of Lemnos (1024)|Chrysocheir]] defeated the local commander at Abydos and proceeded to travel south through the Hellespont.&lt;ref&gt;Wortley (2010), p. 347&lt;/ref&gt; Following the defeat at the [[Battle of Manzikert]], Abydos was seized by the Turks but was recovered in 1086 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Haldon &amp; Davis (2002), p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; In 1092/1093, the city was attacked by [[Tzachas]], a Turkish pirate.&lt;ref&gt;Brand (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]] repaired Abydos' fortifications in the late 12th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nesbitt &quot;/&gt;

By the 13th century AD, the crossing from Lampsacus to [[Gelibolu|Kallipolis]] had become more common and largely replaced the crossing from Abydos to Sestos.&lt;ref&gt;Kazhdan (1991c)&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Fourth Crusade]], in 1204, Venetians seized Abydos,&lt;ref name=&quot;Foss&quot;/&gt; and, following the [[Sack of Constantinople (1204)|Fall of Constantinople]] and the formation of the [[Latin Empire]] later that year, [[Baldwin I, Latin Emperor|Emperor Baldwin]] granted the land between Abydos to [[Adramyttium]] to his brother [[Henry of Flanders]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Tricht (2011), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Henry of Flanders passed through Abydos on 11 November 1204 and continued his march to Adramyttium.&lt;ref&gt;Korobeinikov (2014), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Abydos was seized by the [[Empire of Nicaea]], a successor state of the Eastern Roman Empire, during its offensive in 1206-1207, but was reconquered by the Latin Empire in 1212-1213.&lt;ref&gt;Van Tricht (2011), pp. 109-110&lt;/ref&gt; The city was later recovered by Emperor [[John III Vatatzes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Foss&quot;/&gt; Abydos later fell to the Turks in the 14th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nesbitt &quot;/&gt;

==Ecclesiastical history==
The [[bishopric]] of Abydus in the [[Roman province]] of [[Hellespontus (province)|Hellespontus]] appears in all the ''[[Notitiae Episcopatuum]]'' of the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]] from the mid-7th century until the time of [[Andronicus III]] (1341), first as a [[suffragan]] of [[Cyzicus]] and then from 1084 as a [[metropolitan see]] without suffragans. The earliest bishop mentioned in extant documents is Marcianus, who signed the joint letter of the bishops of Hellespontus to Emperor [[Leo I the Thracian]] in 458, protesting about the murder of [[Proterius of Alexandria]]. A letter of [[Peter the Fuller]] (471–488) mentions a bishop of Abydus called Pamphilus. Ammonius signed the decretal letter of the Council of Constantinople in 518 against [[Severus of Antioch]] and others. Isidorus was at the [[Third Council of Constantinople]] (680–681), Ioannes at the [[Trullan Council]] (692), Theodorus at the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] (787). An unnamed bishop of Abydus was a counsellor of Emperor [[Nicephorus II]] in 969.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Lequien.

Paris. 1909. coll. 209-210.&lt;/ref&gt; Abydos remained a metropolitan see until the city fell to the Turks in the 14th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nesbitt &quot;/&gt;

In c. 1220, during the Latin occupation, the dioceses of Abydos and [[Madytos (Thrace)|Madytos]] were united and placed under direct Papal authority.&lt;ref&gt;Van Tricht (2011), p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; No longer a residential [[bishopric]], Abydus is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana. 2013. {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 821.&lt;/ref&gt;
