'''Ara''' (Latin: &quot;The Altar&quot;) is a southern [[constellation]] situated between [[Scorpius]] and [[Triangulum Australe]]. Ara (Greek: Βωμός) was one of the 48 Greek constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations defined by the [[International Astronomical Union]].

The orange supergiant [[Beta Arae]] is the brightest star in the constellation, with an [[apparent magnitude]] of 2.85—marginally brighter than the blue-white [[Alpha Arae]]. Seven star systems host planets. The sunlike star [[Mu Arae]] hosts four planets, while [[Gliese 676]] is a binary red dwarf system with four planets. The Milky Way crosses the northwestern part of Ara.

== History ==
In ancient [[Greek mythology]], Ara was identified as the altar where the gods first made offerings and formed an alliance before defeating the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=82–83}} The nearby [[Milky Way]] represents the smoke rising from the offerings on the altar,{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=229}}

Ara is one of the southernmost constellations depicted by [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref name=barentine&gt;{{cite book | title=The Lost Constellations | author=Barentine, John C. | chapter= Officina Typographica | page=13 | isbn=978-3-319-22794-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been recorded by [[Aratus]] in 270 BCE as lying close to the horizon, and the [[Almagest]] portrays stars as far south as [[Gamma Arae]]. Professor of astronomy [[Bradley Schaefer]] has proposed that ancient observers must have been able to see as far south as [[Zeta Arae]] to define a pattern that looked like an altar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The latitude and epoch for the formation of the southern Greek constellations | author=Schaefer, Bradley E. |journal= Journal for the History of Astronomy| issn= 0021-8286|volume= 33| series= 4|issue=113| pages= 313–50 |year=2002| bibcode=2002JHA....33..313S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ara Bode.jpg|thumb|left|[[Johann Elert Bode]]'s illustration of Ara, from his ''Uranographia'' (1801)]]
In illustrations, Ara is usually depicted as an [[altar]] with its smoke 'rising' southward.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Ara}} However, depictions of Ara often vary in their details. In the early days of printing, a 1482 [[woodcut]] of [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]]'s classic ''Poeticon Astronomicon'' depicts the altar as surrounded by demons.&lt;ref name=Kanas&gt;{{cite book|last=Kanas|first=Nick|title=History, Artistry, and Cartography|edition=Second|date=2012|publisher=Praxis Publishing|location=Chichester, U.K.|isbn=978-1-4614-0916-8|page=136|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4614-0917-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Johann Bayer]] in 1603 depicted Ara as an altar with burning incense; the flames rise southward as in most atlases. [[Hyginus]] also depicted Ara as an altar with burning incense, though his Ara featured devils on either side of the flames. However, [[Willem Blaeu]], a Dutch uranographer active in the 16th and 17th centuries, drew Ara as an altar designed for sacrifice, with a burning animal offering. Unlike most depictions, the smoke from Blaeu's Ara rises northward, represented by [[Alpha Arae]].

=== Equivalents ===
In [[Ara (Chinese astronomy)|Chinese astronomy]], the stars of the constellation Ara lie within ''[[Azure Dragon|The Azure Dragon of the East]]'' (東方青龍, ''Dōng Fāng Qīng Lóng'').{{sfn|AEEA|2006}} Five stars of Ara formed Guī (龜), a [[tortoise]], while another three formed Chǔ (杵), a [[pestle]].

==Characteristics==
Covering 237.1 square degrees and hence 0.575% of the sky, Ara ranks 63rd of the [[88 modern constellations]] by area.&lt;ref name=tirionconst&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/constellations1.htm | title=Constellations: Andromeda–Indus | work= Star Tales |author=Ridpath, Ian |author-link=Ian Ridpath|publisher=self-published | accessdate= 18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its position in the [[Southern Celestial Hemisphere]] means that the whole [[constellation]] is visible to observers south of [[22nd parallel north|22°N]].&lt;ref name=tirionconst/&gt;{{efn|1=Although parts of the constellation technically rise above the horizon to observers between the 22°N and [[44th parallel north|44°N]], stars within a few degrees of the horizon are to all intents and purposes unobservable.&lt;ref name=tirionconst/&gt;}} [[Scorpius]] runs along the length of its northern border, while [[Norma (constellation)|Norma]] and [[Triangulum Australe]] border it to the west, [[Apus]] to the south, and [[Pavo (constellation)|Pavo]] and [[Telescopium]] to the east respectively. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union, is Ara.&lt;ref name=&quot;pa30_469&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Russell | first=Henry Norris |author-link=Henry Norris Russell | title=The New International Symbols for the Constellations | journal=[[Popular Astronomy (US magazine)|Popular Astronomy]] | volume=30 | page=469 | bibcode=1922PA.....30..469R | date=1922 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930,{{efn|1=Delporte had proposed standardising the constellation boundaries to the International Astronomical Union, who had agreed and gave him the lead role&lt;ref name=tirionconstbnd&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/boundaries.htm | title=Constellation boundaries: How the modern constellation outlines came to be| work= Star Tales |author=Ridpath, Ian |author-link=Ian Ridpath|publisher=self-published | accessdate= 18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} are defined by a polygon of twelve segments.

=== Stars ===

{{see also|List of stars in Ara}}
Bayer gave eight stars [[Bayer designation]]s, labelling them Alpha through to Theta, though he had never seen the constellation directly as it never rises above the horizon in Germany. After charting the southern constellations, Lacaille recharted the stars of Ara from Alpha though to Sigma, including three pairs of stars next to each other as Epsilon, Kappa and Nu.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=42–43}}

Ara contains part of the Milky Way to the south of [[Scorpius]] and thus has rich star fields.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=82–83}} Within the constellation's borders, there are 71 stars brighter than or equal to [[apparent magnitude]]&amp;nbsp;6.5.{{efn|1=Objects of magnitude 6.5 are among the faintest visible to the unaided eye in suburban-rural transition night skies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/resources/darksky/3304011.html?page=1&amp;c=y|title=The Bortle Dark-Sky Scale|last=Bortle|first=John E.|date=February 2001|work=[[Sky &amp; Telescope]]|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=tirionconst/&gt;

[[Exoplanet]]s have been discovered in seven star systems in the constellation. [[Mu Arae]] is a sunlike star that hosts four planets. [[HD 152079]] is a sunlike star with a planet. [[HD 154672]] is an ageing sunlike star with a [[Hot Jupiter]]. [[HD 154857]] is a sunlike star with one confirmed and one suspected planet. [[HD 156411]] is a star hotter and larger than the sun with a gas giant planet in orbit. [[Gliese 674]] is a nearby red dwarf star with a planet. [[Gliese 676]] is a binary star system composed of two red dwarves with four planets.

=== Deep-sky objects ===

The northwest corner of Ara is crossed by the [[galactic plane]] of the [[Milky Way]] and contains several [[open cluster]]s (notably [[NGC 6200]]) and [[diffuse nebula]]e (including the bright cluster/nebula pair [[NGC 6188]] and [[NGC 6193]]). The brightest of the [[globular cluster]]s, sixth magnitude [[NGC 6397]], lies at a distance of just {{convert|6500|ly|km}}, making it one of the closest globular clusters to the [[Solar System]].{{sfn|Dunlop|2005}}

Ara also contains [[Westerlund 1]], a [[super star cluster]] that contains the red supergiant [[Westerlund 1-26]], one of the largest stars known.

Although Ara lies close to the heart of the Milky Way, two [[spiral galaxies]] (NGC 6215 and [[NGC 6221]]) are visible near star [[Eta Arae]].{{sfn|Dunlop|2005}}

==== Open clusters ====

* [[NGC 6193]] is an [[open cluster]] containing approximately 30 stars with an overall magnitude of 5.0 and a size of 0.25 square degrees, about half the size of the [[full Moon]]. It is approximately 4200 light-years from Earth. It has one bright member, a double star with a blue-white hued primary of magnitude 5.6 and a secondary of magnitude 6.9. NGC 6193 is surrounded by [[NGC 6188]], a faint [[nebula]] only normally visible in [[astrophotography|long-exposure photographs]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=82–83}}
* [[NGC 6200]]
* [[NGC 6204]]
* [[NGC 6208]]
* [[NGC 6250]]
* [[NGC 6253]]
* [[IC 4651]]

==== Globular clusters ====

* [[NGC 6352]]
* [[NGC 6362]]
* [[NGC 6397]] is a [[globular cluster]] with an overall magnitude of 6.0; it is visible to the naked eye under exceptionally dark skies and is normally visible in binoculars. It is a fairly close globular cluster, at a distance of 10,500 light-years.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=82–83}}

=== Planetary Nebulae ===

* The [[Stingray Nebula]] (Hen 3-1357), the youngest known planetary nebula as of 2010, formed in Ara; the light from its formation was first observable around 1987.
* [[NGC 6326]].  A planetary nebula that might have a binary system at its center.

== Namesakes ==

[[USS Ara (AK-136)]] was a [[United States Navy]] [[Crater class cargo ship]] named after the constellation.
