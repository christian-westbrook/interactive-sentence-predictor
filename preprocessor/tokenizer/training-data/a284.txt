{{Infobox actinium}}
'''Actinium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&amp;nbsp;'''Ac''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;89.  Actinium gave the name to the [[actinide]] series, a group of 15 similar elements between actinium and [[lawrencium]] in the [[periodic table]]. It is also sometimes considered the first of the 7th-period [[transition metal]]s, although lawrencium is less commonly given that position. Discovered in 1899, it was the first [[Primordial element|non-primordial radioactive element]] to be isolated. [[Polonium]], [[radium]] and [[radon]] were observed before actinium, but they were not isolated until 1902.

A soft, silvery-white [[radioactive]] metal, actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation. As with most [[lanthanide]]s and many [[actinide]]s, actinium assumes [[oxidation state]] +3 in nearly all its chemical compounds. Actinium is found only in traces in [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] ores as the [[isotope]] &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac, which decays with a [[half-life]] of 21.772 years, predominantly emitting [[beta particle|beta]] and sometimes [[alpha particle]]s, and &lt;sup&gt;228&lt;/sup&gt;Ac, which is beta active with a half-life of 6.15 hours. One [[tonne]] of natural [[uranium]] in ore contains about 0.2 milligrams of actinium-227, and one tonne of natural thorium contains about 5 nanograms of actinium-228. The close similarity of physical and chemical properties of actinium and [[lanthanum]] makes separation of actinium from the ore impractical. Instead, the element is prepared, in milligram amounts, by the neutron irradiation of &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;{{radium}} in a [[nuclear reactor]]. Owing to its scarcity, high price and radioactivity, actinium has no significant industrial use. Its current applications include a neutron source and an agent for [[radiation therapy]] targeting cancer cells in the body.

==History==
[[André-Louis Debierne]], a French chemist, announced the discovery of a new element in 1899. He separated it from [[uraninite|pitchblende]] residues left by [[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] after they had extracted [[radium]]. In 1899, Debierne described the substance as similar to [[titanium]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Sur un nouvelle matière radio-active |first = André-Louis |last = Debierne |journal = Comptes rendus |volume = 129 |pages = 593–595 |date = 1899 |url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3085b/f593.table |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (in 1900) as similar to [[thorium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Sur un nouvelle matière radio-actif – l'actinium |first = André-Louis |last = Debierne |journal = Comptes rendus |volume = 130 |pages = 906–908 |date = 1900–1901 |url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3086n/f906.table |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Oskar Giesel]] independently discovered actinium in 1902&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Ueber Radium und radioactive Stoffe |first = Friedrich Oskar |last = Giesel |journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemische Geselschaft |volume = 35 |issue = 3 |pages = 3608–3611 |date = 1902 |doi = 10.1002/cber.190203503187 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a substance being similar to [[lanthanum]] and called it &quot;emanium&quot; in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Ueber den Emanationskörper (Emanium) |first = Friedrich Oskar |last = Giesel |journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemische Geselschaft |volume = 37 |issue = 2 |pages = 1696–1699 |date = 1904 |doi = 10.1002/cber.19040370280 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a comparison of the substances half-lives determined by Debierne,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Sur l'actinium |first = André-Louis |last = Debierne |journal = Comptes rendus |volume = 139 |pages = 538–540 |date = 1904 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harriet Brooks]] in 1904, and [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Otto Sackur]] in 1905, Debierne's chosen name for the new element was retained because it had seniority, despite the contradicting chemical properties he claimed for the element at different times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Ueber Emanium |first = Friedrich Oskar |last = Giesel |journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemische Geselschaft |volume = 37 |issue = 2 |pages = 1696–1699 |date = 1904 |doi = 10.1002/cber.19040370280 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Ueber Emanium |first = Friedrich Oskar |last = Giesel |journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemische Geselschaft |volume = 38 |issue = 1 |pages = 775–778 |date = 1905 |doi = 10.1002/cber.190503801130 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the now-known chemistry of actinium precludes its presence as anything other than a minor constituent of Debierne's 1899 and 1900 results; in fact, the chemical properties he reported make it likely that he had, instead, accidentally identified [[protactinium]], which would not be discovered for another fourteen years, only to have it disappear due to its hydrolysis and adsorption onto his laboratory equipment. This has led some authors to advocate that Giesel alone should be credited with the discovery.&lt;ref name=Kirby/&gt; A less confrontational vision of scientific discovery is proposed by Adloff.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adloff&quot; /&gt; He suggests that hindsight criticism of the early publications should be mitigated by the then nascent state of radiochemistry: highlighting the prudence of Debierne's claims in the original papers, he notes that nobody can contend that Debierne's substance did not contain actinium.&lt;ref name=Adloff/&gt; Debierne, who is now considered by the vast majority of historians as the discoverer, lost interest in the element and left the topic. Giesel, on the other hand, can rightfully be credited with the first preparation of radiochemically pure actinium and with the identification of its atomic number 89.&lt;ref name=discovery/&gt;

The name actinium originates from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''aktis, aktinos'' (ακτίς, ακτίνος), meaning beam or ray.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; Its symbol Ac is also used in abbreviations of other compounds that have nothing to do with actinium, such as [[acetyl]], [[acetate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Gilley, Cynthia Brooke |author2=University of California, San Diego.

==Properties==
Actinium is a soft, silvery-white,&lt;ref name=&quot;blueglow&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=brit&gt;''Actinium'', in Encyclopædia Britannica, 15th edition, 1995, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; [[radioactive]], metallic element. Its estimated [[shear modulus]] is similar to that of lead.&lt;ref&gt;Seitz, Frederick and Turnbull, David  (1964) [https://books.google.com/books?id=F9V3a-0V3r8C&amp;pg=PA289 ''Solid state physics: advances in research and applications'']. Academic Press. {{ISBN|0-12-607716-9}} pp. 289–291&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to its strong radioactivity, actinium glows in the dark with a pale blue light, which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard A. Muller |title=Physics and Technology for Future Presidents: An Introduction to the Essential Physics Every World Leader Needs to Know |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jMWCDsJesbcC&amp;pg=PA136 |date= 2010 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-13504-5 |pages=136–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actinium has similar chemical properties to [[lanthanum]] and other lanthanides, and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores. Solvent extraction and [[ion chromatography]] are commonly used for the separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Chemistry of the Actinide Elements Annual Review of Nuclear Science |volume = 1 |pages = 245–262 |date = 1952 |first = J.

The first element of the [[actinide]]s, actinium gave the group its name, much as [[lanthanum]] had done for the [[lanthanide]]s. The group of elements is more diverse than the lanthanides and therefore it was not until 1928 that [[Charles Janet]] proposed the most significant change to [[Dmitri Mendeleev]]'s [[periodic table]] since the recognition of the lanthanides, by introducing the actinides, a move suggested again in 1945 by [[Glenn T. Seaborg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = The Transuranium Elements |first = Glenn T. |last = Seaborg |journal = Science |volume = 104 |issue = 2704 |date = 1946 |pages = 379–386 |jstor=1675046 |doi = 10.1126/science.104.2704.379 |pmid = 17842184 |bibcode = 1946Sci...104..379S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air forming a white coating of [[actinium oxide]] that impedes further oxidation.&lt;ref name=&quot;blueglow&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title = Preparation of Actinium Metal |first = Joseph G. |last = Stites |journal = J.

==Chemical compounds==
Only a limited number of actinium compounds are known including AcF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, AcCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, AcBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, AcOF, AcOCl, AcOBr, Ac&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, [[Actinium oxide|Ac&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] and AcPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Except for AcPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, they are all similar to the corresponding lanthanum compounds. They all contain actinium in the oxidation state +3.&lt;ref name=bse/&gt;&lt;ref name=j2/&gt; In particular, the lattice constants of the analogous lanthanum and actinium compounds differ by only a few percent.&lt;ref name=j2/&gt;

Here ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are lattice constants, No is space group number and ''Z'' is the number of [[formula unit]]s per [[unit cell]]. Density was not measured directly but calculated from the lattice parameters.

===Oxides===
{{main article|Actinium(III) oxide}}
[[Actinium oxide]] (Ac&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) can be obtained by heating the hydroxide at 500&amp;nbsp;°C or the [[oxalate]] at 1100&amp;nbsp;°C, in vacuum. Its crystal lattice is [[Isomorphism (crystallography)|isotypic]] with the oxides of most trivalent rare-earth metals.&lt;ref name=j2/&gt;

===Halides===
Actinium trifluoride can be produced either in solution or in solid reaction. The former reaction is carried out at room temperature, by adding [[hydrofluoric acid]] to a solution containing actinium ions. In the latter method, actinium metal is treated with hydrogen fluoride vapors at 700&amp;nbsp;°C in an all-platinum setup. Treating actinium trifluoride with [[ammonium hydroxide]] at 900–1000&amp;nbsp;°C yields [[oxyfluoride]] AcOF. Whereas lanthanum oxyfluoride can be easily obtained by burning lanthanum trifluoride in air at 800&amp;nbsp;°C for an hour, similar treatment of actinium trifluoride yields no AcOF and only results in melting of the initial product.&lt;ref name=j2/&gt;&lt;ref name=m87&gt;Meyer, pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt;

:AcF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → AcOF + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F

Actinium trichloride is obtained by reacting actinium hydroxide or [[oxalate]] with [[carbon tetrachloride]] vapors at temperatures above 960&amp;nbsp;°C. Similar to oxyfluoride, actinium [[oxychloride]] can be prepared by hydrolyzing actinium trichloride with [[ammonium hydroxide]] at 1000&amp;nbsp;°C. However, in contrast to the oxyfluoride, the oxychloride could well be synthesized by igniting a solution of actinium trichloride in [[hydrochloric acid]] with [[ammonia]].&lt;ref name=j2/&gt;

Reaction of [[aluminium bromide]] and actinium oxide yields actinium tribromide:
:Ac&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 AlBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 AcBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

and treating it with ammonium hydroxide at 500&amp;nbsp;°C results in the oxybromide AcOBr.&lt;ref name=j2/&gt;

===Other compounds===
Actinium hydride was obtained by reduction of actinium trichloride with potassium at 300&amp;nbsp;°C, and its structure was deduced by analogy with the corresponding LaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydride. The source of hydrogen in the reaction was uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixing [[monosodium phosphate]] (NaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) with a solution of actinium in hydrochloric acid yields white-colored actinium phosphate hemihydrate (AcPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·0.5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), and heating actinium oxalate with [[hydrogen sulfide]] vapors at 1400&amp;nbsp;°C for a few minutes results in a black actinium sulfide Ac&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It may possibly be produced by acting with a mixture of [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[carbon disulfide]] on [[actinium oxide]] at 1000&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=j2/&gt;

==Isotopes==
{{main article|Isotopes of actinium}}
Naturally occurring actinium is composed of two radioactive [[isotope]]s; {{chem|227|Ac}} (from the radioactive family of {{chem|235|U}}) and {{chem|228|Ac}} (a granddaughter of {{chem|232|Th}}). {{chem|227|Ac}} decays mainly as a [[beta decay|beta emitter]] with a very small energy, but in 1.38% of cases it emits an [[alpha particle]], so it can readily be identified through [[alpha spectrometry]].&lt;ref name=Kirby/&gt; Thirty-six [[radioisotope]]s have been identified, the most stable being {{chem|227|Ac}} with a [[half-life]] of 21.772 years, {{chem|225|Ac}} with a half-life of 10.0 days and {{chem|226|Ac}} with a half-life of 29.37 hours. All remaining [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives that are less than 10 hours and the majority of them have half-lives shorter than one minute. The shortest-lived known isotope of actinium is {{chem|217|Ac}} (half-life of 69 nanoseconds) which decays through [[alpha decay]] and [[electron capture]]. Actinium also has two known [[meta state]]s.&lt;ref name =&quot;nubas&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last = Audi |first = Georges |title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties |journal = Nuclear Physics A |volume = 729 |pages = 3–128 |publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center |date = 2003 |doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001 |bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A |last2 = Bersillon |first2 = O. |last3 = Blachot |first3 = J. |last4 = Wapstra |first4 = A.

Purified {{chem|227|Ac}} comes into equilibrium with its decay products after about a half of year. It decays according to its 21.772-year half-life emitting mostly beta (98.62%) and some alpha particles (1.38%);&lt;ref name=nubas/&gt; the successive decay products are part of the [[actinium series]]. Owing to the low available amounts, low energy of its beta particles (maximum 44.8&amp;nbsp;keV) and low intensity of alpha radiation, {{chem|227|Ac}} is difficult to detect directly by its emission and it is therefore traced via its decay products.&lt;ref name=bse&gt;[http://bse.sci-lib.com/article008169.html Actinium], [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; The isotopes of actinium range in [[atomic weight]] from 206&amp;nbsp;[[atomic mass unit|u]] ({{chem|206|Ac}}) to 236&amp;nbsp;u ({{chem|236|Ac}}).&lt;ref name =&quot;nubas&quot;/&gt;

==Occurrence and synthesis==
[[File:Uraninite-39029.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Uraninite]] ores have elevated concentrations of actinium.]]
Actinium is found only in traces in [[uranium]] ores – one tonne of uranium in ore contains about 0.2 milligrams of &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac&lt;ref name=j1&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/ja01158a033 |last1=Hagemann |date=1950 |first1=French |pages=768–771 |volume=72 |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |title=The Isolation of Actinium |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=g946&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd|page=946}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and in [[thorium]] ores, which contain about 5 nanograms of &lt;sup&gt;228&lt;/sup&gt;Ac per one tonne of thorium. The actinium [[isotope]] &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac is a transient member of the [[Decay chain#Actinium series|uranium-actinium series]] [[decay chain]], which begins with the parent isotope [[Uranium-235|&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U]] (or [[Plutonium-239|&lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu]]) and ends with the stable lead isotope [[Isotopes of lead|&lt;sup&gt;207&lt;/sup&gt;Pb]]. The isotope &lt;sup&gt;228&lt;/sup&gt;Ac is a transient member of the [[Decay chain#Thorium series|thorium series]] decay chain, which begins with the parent isotope [[Thorium-232|&lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th]] and ends with the stable lead isotope [[Isotopes of lead|&lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;Pb]]. Another actinium isotope (&lt;sup&gt;225&lt;/sup&gt;Ac) was transiently present in the [[Decay chain#Neptunium series|neptunium series]] [[decay chain]], beginning with [[Neptunium|&lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np]] (or [[Uranium-233|&lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U]]) and ending with [[thallium]] (&lt;sup&gt;205&lt;/sup&gt;Tl) and near-stable [[bismuth]] (&lt;sup&gt;209&lt;/sup&gt;Bi), but this chain existed only in the early [[Solar System]], due to the short half-life of neptunium-237.

The low natural concentration, and the close similarity of physical and chemical properties to those of lanthanum and other lanthanides, which are always abundant in actinium-bearing ores, render separation of actinium from the ore impractical, and complete separation was never achieved.&lt;ref name=j2&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/ja01158a034 |last1=Fried |date=1950 |first1=Sherman |pages=771–775 |volume=72 |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |last2=Hagemann |first2=French |last3=Zachariasen |first3=W. H. |title=The Preparation and Identification of Some Pure Actinium Compounds |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, actinium is prepared, in milligram amounts, by the neutron irradiation of &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;{{radium}} in a [[nuclear reactor]].&lt;ref name=g946/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Emeleus, H.

{}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The reaction yield is about 2% of the radium weight. &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac can further capture neutrons resulting in small amounts of &lt;sup&gt;228&lt;/sup&gt;Ac. After the synthesis, actinium is separated from radium and from the products of decay and nuclear fusion, such as thorium, polonium, lead and bismuth. The extraction can be performed with thenoyltrifluoroacetone-[[benzene]] solution from an aqueous solution of the radiation products, and the selectivity to a certain element is achieved by adjusting the [[pH]] (to about 6.0 for actinium).&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; An alternative procedure is anion exchange with an appropriate [[resin]] in [[nitric acid]], which can result in a separation factor of 1,000,000 for radium and actinium vs. thorium in a two-stage process. Actinium can then be separated from radium, with a ratio of about 100, using a low cross-linking cation exchange resin and nitric acid as [[eluant]].&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;225&lt;/sup&gt;Ac was first produced artificially at the [[Institute for Transuranium Elements]] (ITU) in Germany using a [[cyclotron]] and at [[St George Hospital, Sydney|St George Hospital]] in Sydney using a [[Linear particle accelerator|linac]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.apradiso.2008.11.012 |date = 2009 |author = Melville, G |author2 = Allen, Bj |title = Cyclotron and linac production of Ac-225 |volume = 67 |issue = 4 |pages = 549–55 |pmid = 19135381 |journal = Applied Radiation and Isotopes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rare isotope has potential applications in radiation therapy and is most efficiently produced by bombarding a radium-226 target with 20–30&amp;nbsp;MeV [[deuterium]] ions. This reaction also yields &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;Ac which however decays with a half-life of 29 hours and thus does not contaminate &lt;sup&gt;225&lt;/sup&gt;Ac.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Pamela J.; Jackson, Paul and Kingsley, Elizabeth Anne (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=K1y6k5bdlWkC&amp;pg=PA336 ''Prostate cancer methods and protocols'']. Humana Press. {{ISBN|0-89603-978-1}}, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt;

Actinium metal has been prepared by the reduction of actinium fluoride with [[lithium]] vapor in vacuum at a temperature between 1100 and 1300&amp;nbsp;°C. Higher temperatures resulted in evaporation of the product and lower ones lead to an incomplete transformation. Lithium was chosen among other [[alkali metal]]s because its fluoride is most volatile.&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;Hammond, C. R. ''The Elements'' in {{RubberBible86th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;blueglow&quot;/&gt;

==Applications==
Owing to its scarcity, high price and radioactivity, actinium currently has no significant industrial use.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;&lt;!--http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=4066566--&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac is highly radioactive and was therefore studied for use as an active element of [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s, for example in spacecraft. The oxide of &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac pressed with [[beryllium]] is also an efficient [[neutron source]] with the activity exceeding that of the standard americium-beryllium and radium-beryllium pairs.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;Russell, Alan M. and Lee, Kok Loong (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=fIu58uZTE-gC&amp;pg=PA470 ''Structure-property relations in nonferrous metals'']. Wiley. {{ISBN|0-471-64952-X}}, pp. 470–471&lt;/ref&gt; In all those applications, &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac (a beta source) is merely a progenitor which generates alpha-emitting isotopes upon its decay. Beryllium captures alpha particles and emits neutrons owing to its large cross-section for the (α,n) nuclear reaction:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{9}_{4}Be\ +\ ^{4}_{2}He\ \longrightarrow \ ^{12}_{\ 6}C\ +\ ^{1}_{0}n\ +\ \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;AcBe neutron sources can be applied in a [[neutron probe]] – a standard device for measuring the quantity of water present in soil, as well as moisture/density for quality control in highway construction.&lt;ref&gt;Majumdar, D.

This isotope has a half-life of 10 days that makes it much more suitable for radiation therapy than &lt;sup&gt;213&lt;/sup&gt;Bi (half-life 46 minutes). Not only &lt;sup&gt;225&lt;/sup&gt;Ac itself, but also its daughters, emit alpha particles which kill cancer cells in the body. The major difficulty with application of &lt;sup&gt;225&lt;/sup&gt;Ac was that intravenous injection of simple actinium complexes resulted in their accumulation in the bones and liver for a period of tens of years. As a result, after the cancer cells were quickly killed by alpha particles from &lt;sup&gt;225&lt;/sup&gt;Ac, the radiation from the actinium and its daughters might induce new mutations. To solve this problem, &lt;sup&gt;225&lt;/sup&gt;Ac was bound to a [[Chelation|chelating]] agent, such as [[citrate]], [[ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid]] (EDTA) or [[pentetic acid|diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid]] (DTPA). This reduced actinium accumulation in the bones, but the excretion from the body remained slow. Much better results were obtained with such chelating agents as HEHA(1,4,7,10,13,16-hexaazacyclohexadecane-N,N',N'`,N'``,N'``',N'``'`-hexaacetic acid)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Improved in Vivo Stability of Actinium-225 Macrocyclic Complexes|pmid=10425108|journal=J Med Chem |date=1999 |volume=42|issue=15|pages=2988–9|author=Deal K.A.|author2=Davis I.A.|author3=Mirzadeh S.|author4=Kennel S.J.|author5=Brechbiel M.W.|last-author-amp=yes |doi=10.1021/jm990141f}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[DOTA (chelator)|DOTA]] (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) coupled to [[trastuzumab]], a [[monoclonal antibody]] that interferes with the [[HER2/neu]] [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]].

The medium half-life of &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac (21.77 years) makes it very convenient radioactive isotope in modeling the slow vertical mixing of oceanic waters. The associated processes cannot be studied with the required accuracy by direct measurements of current velocities (of the order 50 meters per year). However, evaluation of the concentration depth-profiles for different isotopes allows estimating the mixing rates. The physics behind this method is as follows: oceanic waters contain homogeneously dispersed &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U. Its decay product, &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa, gradually precipitates to the bottom, so that its concentration first increases with depth and then stays nearly constant. &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa decays to &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac; however, the concentration of the latter isotope does not follow the &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa depth profile, but instead increases toward the sea bottom. This occurs because of the mixing processes which raise some additional &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac from the sea bottom. Thus analysis of both &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa and &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac depth profiles allows to model the mixing behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nozaki |first1=Yoshiyuki |title=Excess &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac in deep ocean water |journal=Nature |volume=310 |pages=486–488 |date=1984 |doi=10.1038/310486a0 | issue=5977 | bibcode = 1984Natur.310..486N}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Geibert |first1=W. |last2=Rutgers Van Der Loeff |first2=M.

==Precautions==
&lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac is highly radioactive and experiments with it are carried out in a specially designed laboratory equipped with a tight [[glove box]]. When actinium trichloride is administered intravenously to rats, about 33% of actinium is deposited into the bones and 50% into the liver. Its toxicity is comparable to, but slightly lower than that of americium and plutonium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.2172/4406766 |title = Toxicology of Actinium Equilibrium Mixture |first2 = J. |last = Langham |last2 = Storer |first = W. |date = 1952 | journal = Los Alamos Scientific Lab.: Technical Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; For trace quantities, fume hoods with good aeration suffice; for gram amounts, hot cells with shielding from the intense gamma radiation emitted by &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac are necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ullmann | first1=Cornelius |last1=Keller |first2=Walter |last2=Wolf |first3=Jashovam |last3=Shani | title = Radionuclides, 2.
