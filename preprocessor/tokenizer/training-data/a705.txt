{{Cuisine of China}}

'''American Chinese cuisine''' is a style of [[Chinese cuisine]] developed by [[Americans of Chinese descent]]. The dishes served in many North American [[Chinese restaurant]]s are adapted to American tastes and often differ significantly from those found in China. Of the various [[Chinese cuisine#Regional cuisines|regional cuisines in China]], [[Cantonese cuisine]] has been the most influential in the development of American Chinese food, especially that of [[Toisan]], the origin of most early immigrants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapius&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Complete Asian Cookbook|first=Charmaine|last=Solomon|page= 281 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Mdfacqx2UaQC&amp;pg=PA368 |isbn=9780804837576 |date=April 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RParkinson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parkinson|first1=Rhonda|title=Regional Chinese Cuisine|url=http://chinesefood.about.com/od/regionalchinesecuisine/ss/cookingstyles.htm|accessdate=July 8, 2014|publisher=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Chinese immigrants arrived in the United States to work as miners and railroad workers. As the large groups of Chinese immigrants arrived, laws were put in place preventing them from owning land. They mostly lived together in ghettos, individually referred to as &quot;[[Chinatowns in the United States|Chinatown]]&quot;. Here the immigrants started their own small businesses, including restaurants and laundry services.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; By the 19th century, the Chinese community in [[San Francisco]] operated sophisticated and sometimes luxurious restaurants patronised mainly by Chinese. The restaurants in smaller towns (mostly owned by Chinese immigrants) served food based on what their customers requested, anything ranging from pork chop sandwiches and apple pie, to beans and eggs. Many of these small-town restaurant owners were self-taught family cooks who improvised on different cooking methods and ingredients.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title = The Globalization of Chinese Food|last1 = Wu|first1 = David Y. H.|last2 = Cheung|first2 = Sidney C. H.|publisher = Curzon Press|year = 2002|isbn = 978-0-8248-2582-9|location = Great Britain|page = 57}}&lt;/ref&gt; These smaller restaurants were responsible for developing American Chinese cuisine, where the food was modified to suit a more American palate. First catering to miners and railroad workers, they established new eateries in towns where Chinese food was completely unknown, adapting local ingredients and catering to their customers' tastes.&lt;ref&gt;Ch Six, &quot;The Globalization of Chinese Food: The Early Stages,&quot; in J. A. G. Roberts. ''China to Chinatown: Chinese Food in the West'' (London: Reaktion, 2002) {{ISBN|1-86189-133-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the new flavors and dishes meant they were not strictly Chinese cuisine, these Chinese restaurants have been cultural ambassadors to Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Perceptions of Chinese restaurants in the U.S.: What affects customer satisfaction and behavioral intentions? |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027843190800087X |journal=International Journal of Hospitality Management |date=2009-09-01 |pages=338–348 |volume=28 |issue=3 |doi=10.1016/j.ijhm.2008.10.008 |first=Yinghua |last=Liu |first2=SooCheong (Shawn) |last2=Jang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the way, cooks adapted southern Chinese dishes such as [[chop suey]] and developed a style of Chinese food not found in China. Restaurants (along with Chinese laundries) provided an ethnic niche for small businesses at a time when the Chinese people were excluded from most jobs in the wage economy by ethnic discrimination or lack of language fluency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coe Chop Suey&quot;&gt;Andrew Coe ''Chop Suey: A Cultural History of Chinese Food in the United States'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1920s, this cuisine, particularly chop suey, became popular among middle-class Americans. However, after World War II it began to be dismissed for not being &quot;authentic.&quot; Late 20th century tastes have been more accommodating. {{sfnb|Hayford|2011| p = 11-12}} Take away food became popular amongst Americans, Chinese food becoming a favourite &quot;take out&quot; option. By this time it became evident that Chinese restaurants no longer catered mainly for Chinese customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = China to Chinatown|url = http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/C/bo3536662.html|website = University of Chicago Press|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the continuing success of American Chinese cuisine, including its portrayal to mainland Chinese audiences through the medium of American television [[sitcom]]s, American Chinese restaurants have opened in China itself. Products and ingredients needed to recreate these adapted dishes are imported into China. They include &quot;Philadelphia [[cream cheese]], Skippy [[peanut butter]], [[Corn flakes|cornflakes]] and English [[Mustard seed|mustard powder]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why Shanghai's first American Chinese restaurant is taking off|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34877507|website = BBC News|accessdate = 2016-01-08|first = Celia Hatton BBC|last = News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[Smithsonian National Museum of American History]] displayed some of the historical background and cultural artefacts of American Chinese cuisine in its exhibit entitled, ''Sweet &amp; Sour: A Look at the History of Chinese Food in the United States''.&lt;ref name=&quot;SNMAH&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Sweet &amp; Sour: A Look at the History of Chinese Food in the United States |url=http://apanews.si.edu/2011/03/04/sweet-and-sour-showcase/ |work=Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center |publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of American History |accessdate=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from other regional cuisines in China==

American Chinese food builds from styles and food habits brought from the southern province of [[Guangdong]], typically the Toisan district of Toisan, the origin of most Chinese immigration before the [[Immigration Act of 1924|closure of  immigration from China]] in 1924. These Chinese families developed new styles and used readily available ingredients, especially in California. The types of Chinese American cooking served in restaurants was different from the foods eaten in Chinese American homes. {{sfnb|Hom|1997|}}{{sfnb|Hayford|2011| p = 11-12}}

Among the common differences is to treat [[vegetable]]s as a side dish or [[garnish (food)|garnish]], while traditional cuisines of China emphasize vegetables. This can be seen in the use of [[carrot]]s and [[tomato]]es.  Cuisine in China makes frequent use of Asian [[leaf vegetable]]s like [[bok choy]] and [[kai-lan]] and puts a greater emphasis on fresh [[meat]] and [[seafood]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Oxford&quot;&gt;{{cite book   | title = The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink | author= Andrew F.

[[Image:Chinese buffet2.jpg|left|thumb|250px|A [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] [[buffet]] restaurant in the United States]]
[[Stir frying]], [[pan frying]], and [[deep frying]] tend to be the most common [[Chinese cooking techniques]] used in American Chinese cuisine, which are all easily done using a [[wok]] (a Chinese frying pan with bowl-like features). The food also has a reputation for high levels of [[Monosodium glutamate|MSG]] to enhance the flavor. Market forces and customer demand have encouraged many restaurants to offer &quot;MSG Free&quot; or &quot;No MSG&quot; menus, or to omit this ingredient on request.&lt;ref name = &quot;Oxford&quot;/&gt;

[[File:FriedWonton.jpg|thumb|Carryout Chinese food is commonly served in a paper carton with a wire bail, known as the [[oyster pail]].]]
American Chinese cuisine takes advantage of ingredients not native to and very rarely used in China. One such example is the common use of western [[broccoli]] ({{zh|t=西蘭|p=xīlán}}) instead of Chinese broccoli ([[Gai-lan]], {{zh|t=芥蘭|p=jièlán|labels=no}}) in American Chinese cuisine. Occasionally, western broccoli is also referred to as ''{{lang|yue|{{tonesup|sai1 laan4 fa1}}}}'' in Cantonese ({{zh|t=西蘭花|labels=no}}) in order not to confuse the two styles of broccoli. Among Chinese speakers, however, it is typically understood that one is referring to the leafy vegetable unless otherwise specified.

This is also the case with the words for [[carrot]] (''luo buo'' or ''lo bac,'' or ''hong luo buo'', ''hong'' meaning &quot;red&quot;) and [[onion]] (''cong''). ''Lo bac'', in [[Cantonese]], refers to a large, pungent white [[radish]]. The orange western carrot is known in some areas of China as &quot;foreign [[radish]]&quot; (or more properly ''hung lo bac'' in Cantonese, ''hung'' meaning &quot;red&quot;). When the word for onion, ''cong'', is used, it is understood that one is referring to &quot;green onions&quot; (otherwise known to English-speakers as &quot;[[scallion]]s&quot; or &quot;spring onions&quot;). The larger many-layered onion bulb common in the United States is called ''yang cong''. This translates as &quot;western onion&quot;. These names make it evident that the American broccoli, carrot, and onion are not indigenous to China, and therefore are less common in the traditional cuisines of China.

[[Yeung Chow Fried Rice|Egg fried rice]] in American Chinese cuisine is also prepared differently, with more soy sauce added for more flavor whereas the traditional egg fried rice uses less soy sauce. Some food styles such as [[Dim sum]] were also modified to fit American palates, such as added batter for fried dishes and extra soy sauce.&lt;ref name = &quot;Oxford&quot;/&gt;

[[Salad]]s containing raw or uncooked ingredients are rare in traditional Chinese cuisine, as are Japanese style [[sushi]] or [[sashimi]].  However, an increasing number of American Chinese restaurants, including some upscale establishments, have started to offer these items in response to customer demand.

[[Ming Tsai]], the owner of the Blue Ginger restaurant in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]] and host of [[PBS]] culinary show ''[[Simply Ming]]'', said that American Chinese restaurants typically try to have food representing 3-5 regions of China at one time, have [[chop suey]], or have &quot;fried vegetables and some protein in a thick sauce&quot;, &quot;eight different sweet and sour dishes&quot;, or &quot;a whole page of 20 different chow meins or fried rice dishes&quot;. Tsai said &quot;Chinese-American cuisine is 'dumbed-down' Chinese food. It’s adapted... to be blander, thicker and sweeter for the American public&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://cnneatocracy.wordpress.com/2011/01/19/chef-ming-tsai-wants-you-to-have-a-chinese-friend/ Chef Ming Tsai wants you to have a Chinese friend].&quot; [[CNN]]. January 19, 2011. Retrieved on January 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most American Chinese establishments cater to non-Chinese customers with menus written in English or containing pictures. If separate Chinese-language menus are available, they typically feature items such as [[liver (food)|liver]], [[chicken feet]], or other meat dishes that might deter American customers.  In [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown, New York]],&lt;!-- intentional link to DAB page, discuss before changing --&gt; the restaurants were known for having a &quot;phantom&quot; menu with food preferred by ethnic Chinese, but believed to be disliked by non-Chinese Americans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newyork.grubstreet.com/2009/02/anthony_bourdain_plays_it_safe.html Anthony Bourdain Plays It Safe at Hop Kee, Shuns ‘Phantom Menu’ - Grub Street New York&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Wonton strips]] – commonly served complimentary along with [[duck sauce]] and hot mustard, or with soup when ordering take-out

===Regional American Chinese dishes===
* [[Chow mein sandwich]] – sandwich of chow mein and gravy (Southeastern [[Massachusetts]], [[Rhode Island]]).
* [[Chop suey sandwich]] – sandwich of chicken chop suey on a hamburger bun (North Shore of [[Massachusetts]]).
* [[St. Paul sandwich]] – [[egg foo young]] patty in plain white [[sandwich bread]] ([[St. Louis, Missouri]]).
* [[Springfield-style cashew chicken]] – a style of [[cashew chicken]] that combines breaded deep fried chicken, cashews, and oyster sauce. ([[Springfield, Missouri]]).
* [[Yaka mein]] - Chinese-Creole food found in [[New Orleans]] that evolved from [[beef noodle soup]]

===North American versions found in China===
[[File:Egg foo young.JPG|thumb|Egg foo young]]
* [[Cashew chicken]] – Stir fried tender chicken pieces with cashews.
* [[Chow mein]] – literally means &quot;stir-fried [[noodle]]s&quot;. Chow mein consists of fried crispy noodles with bits of meat and vegetables. It can come with chicken, pork, shrimp or beef.
* [[Egg foo young]] – a Chinese-style omelet with vegetables and meat, usually served with a brown gravy. While some restaurants in North America deep-fry the omelet, versions found in Asia are more likely to fry in the wok.
* [[Egg roll]] – while [[spring roll]]s have a thin, light beige crispy skin that flakes apart, and is filled with mushrooms, bamboo, and other vegetables inside, the American style eggroll has a thicker, chewier, dark brown bubbly skin stuffed with cabbage and usually bits of meat or seafood (such as pork or shrimp), but no egg.
* [[Fried rice]] – fried rice dishes are popular offerings in American Chinese food due to the speed and ease of preparation and their appeal to American tastes. Fried rice is generally prepared with rice cooled overnight, allowing restaurants to put  leftover rice to good use (freshly cooked rice is actually less suitable for fried rice). The Chinese American version of this dish typically uses more soy sauce than the versions found in China. Fried rice is offered with different combinations of meat and vegetables.
* [[Ginger beef]] – ({{zh|t=生薑牛肉|p=shēngjiāng niúròu|labels=no}}) Tender beef cut in chunks, mixed with ginger and Chinese mixed vegetables.
* [[Ginger fried beef]] – ({{zh|t=乾炒牛肉絲|p=gānchǎo niúròu-sī|labels=no}} Tender beef cut in strings, battered, deep dried, then re-fried in a wok mixed with a sweet sauce, a variation of a popular Northern Chinese dish.
* [[Hulatang]] – a Chinese traditional soup with hot spices, often called &quot;spicy soup&quot; on menus
* [[Kung Pao chicken]] – The  [[Sichuan]] dish is spicy hot, but the versions served in North America tend to be less so if at all, and sometimes leave out the [[Sichuan pepper]] that is a fundamental part of the original dish.
* [[Lo mein]] (&quot;stirred noodles&quot;). These noodles are frequently made with eggs and flour, making them chewier than simply using water. Thick, spaghetti shaped noodles are pan fried with vegetables (mainly bok choy and Chinese cabbage ([[nappa cabbage|nappa]])) and meat. Sometimes this dish is referred to as &quot;chow mein&quot; (which literally means &quot;fried noodles&quot; in Cantonese).
* [[Mei Fun]] (see [[Rice vermicelli]] dishes)
* [[Moo shu pork]] – The original version uses more typically Chinese ingredients (including [[Cloud ear fungus|wood ear]] fungi and [[daylily]] buds) and thin flour pancakes while the American version uses vegetables more familiar to Americans, and thicker pancakes. This dish is quite popular in Chinese restaurants in the United States, but not so popular in China.
* [[Orange chicken]] – chopped, battered, fried chicken with a sweet orange flavored chili sauce that is thickened and glazed. The traditional version consists of stir-fried chicken in a light, slightly sweet soy sauce that is flavored with dried orange peels.
* [[Wonton soup]] – In most American Chinese restaurants, only wonton dumplings in broth are served, while versions found in China may come with noodles. In Canton, Wonton Soup can be a full meal in itself, consisting of thin egg noodles and several pork and prawn wontons in a pork or chicken soup broth or noodle broth. Especially in takeout restaurants, wonton are often made with thicker dough skins.
*[[Beijing beef]] – In China, this dish uses ''[[gai-lan]]'' (Chinese broccoli) rather than American [[broccoli]].

==Regional variations==

===San Francisco===
Since the early 1990s, many American Chinese restaurants influenced by [[California cuisine]] have opened in San Francisco and the Bay Area. The trademark dishes of American Chinese cuisine remain on the menu, but there is more emphasis on fresh vegetables, and the selection is vegetarian-friendly.

This new cuisine has exotic ingredients like [[mango]]s and [[portobello mushroom]]s. [[Brown rice]] is often offered as an optional alternative to [[white rice]]. Some restaurants substitute grilled wheat flour [[tortilla]]s for the rice pancakes in [[mu shu]] dishes. This occurs even in some restaurants that would not otherwise be identified as California Chinese, both the more Westernized places and the more authentic places. There is a Mexican bakery that sells some restaurants thinner tortillas made for use with mu shu. Mu shu purists do not always react positively to this trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Mu Shu Tortilla Flats: Chinese restaurant needs better mu shu wraps |date= February 27, 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007080309/http://news.asianweek.com/news/view_article.html?article_id=5b6c82e1ca42c0c4a952c682acd5b192 |archivedate=October 7, 2007 |work=AsianWeek |quote=Everything was well and good with one huge exception: The mu shu wrappers were flour tortillas!|url=http://news.asianweek.com/news/view_article.html?article_id=5b6c82e1ca42c0c4a952c682acd5b192 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, many restaurants serving more native-style Chinese cuisines exist, due to the high numbers and proportion of ethnic Chinese in San Francisco and the Bay Area. Restaurants specializing in Cantonese, Sichuanese, Hunanese, Northern Chinese, Shanghainese, Taiwanese, and Hong Kong traditions are widely available, as are more specialized restaurants such as seafood restaurants, [[Hong Kong-style Western cuisine|Hong Kong-style diners and cafes]], also known as ''[[Cha chaan teng]]'' ({{zh|t=茶餐廳|p=chácāntīng|labels=no}}), [[dim sum]] teahouses, and [[hot pot]] restaurants. Many Chinatown areas also feature [[Chinese bakery products|Chinese bakeries]], [[boba milk tea]] shops, [[siu mei|roasted meat]], [[Chinese Buddhist cuisine|vegetarian cuisine]], and specialized dessert shops. [[Chop suey]] is not widely available in [[San Francisco]], and the city's chow mein is different from Midwestern chow mein.

Authentic restaurants with Chinese-language menus may offer &quot;[[yellow-hair chicken]]&quot; ({{zh|t=黃毛雞|cy=wòhng mouh gāai|p=huángmáo jī|l=yellow-feather chicken|links=no}}), essentially a [[free range|free-range]] chicken, as opposed to typical American mass-farmed chicken. Yellow-hair chicken is valued for its flavor, but needs to be cooked properly to be tender due to its lower fat and higher muscle content. This dish usually does not appear on the English-language menu.

[[Dau Miu]] ({{zh|c=豆苗|p=dòumiáo|labels=no}}) is a Chinese vegetable that has become popular since the early 1990s, and now not only appears on English-language menus, usually as &quot;pea shoots&quot;, but is often served by upscale non-Asian restaurants as well. Originally it was only available during a few months of the year, but it is now grown in greenhouses and is available year-round.

===Hawaii===
Hawaiian-Chinese food developed a bit differently from the continental United States. Owing to the diversity of ethnicities in Hawaii and the history of the [[Chinese immigration to Hawaii|Chinese influence in Hawaii]], resident Chinese cuisine forms a component of the [[cuisine of Hawaii]], which is a [[fusion cuisine|fusion]] of different culinary traditions. Some Chinese dishes are typically served as part of [[plate lunch]]es in Hawaii. The names of foods are different as well, such as ''[[Manapua]]'', from Hawaiian meaning &quot;chewed up pork&quot; for dim sum ''bao'', though the meat is not necessarily pork.

== Chinese restaurants and American Jews ==
{{Main article|American Chinese Cuisine in American Jewish Culture}}
The perception that [[American Jews]] eat at Chinese restaurants on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] is documented in media as a common stereotype with a basis in fact.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/12/why-american-jews-eat-chinese-food-on-christmas/384011/ Why Do American Jews Eat Chinese Food on Christmas? — The Atlantic&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-features/1.633512 'Tis the season: Why do Jews eat Chinese food on Christmas? - Jewish World Features - Israel News | Haaretz&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/isaac-zablocki/the-jewish-christmas-trad_b_6272972.html Movies and Chinese Food: The Jewish Christmas Tradition | Isaac Zablocki&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition may have arisen from the lack of other open restaurants on Christmas Day, as well as the close proximity of Jewish and Chinese immigrants to each other in [[New York City]]. It has been portrayed in film and television.

Kosher Chinese Food is also available in large cities in Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods, and are usually under strict Rabbinical Supervision.
