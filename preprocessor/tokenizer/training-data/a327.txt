'''Apiaceae''' or '''Umbelliferae''', is a family of mostly aromatic [[flowering plants]] named after the type genus ''[[Apium]]'' and commonly known as the '''celery''', '''carrot''' or '''parsley family'''. It is the 16th-largest family of flowering plants, with more than 3,700 [[species]] in 434 [[genus|genera]]&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;Stevens, P.F. (2001 onwards). [http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/ Angiosperm Phylogeny Website]. Version 9, June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; including such well-known and economically important plants such as [[angelica]], [[anise]], [[asafoetida]], [[caraway]], [[carrot]], [[celery]], [[chervil]],  [[coriander]], [[cumin]], [[dill]], [[fennel]], [[conium|hemlock]], [[lovage]], [[cow parsley]], [[parsley]], [[parsnip]], [[Eryngium maritimum|sea holly]], [[Heracleum mantegazzianum| giant hogweed]] and [[silphium]] (a plant whose identity is unclear and which may be extinct).

== Description ==

Most Apiaceae are [[annual plant|annual]], [[biennial plant|biennial]] or [[perennial plant|perennial]] [[herbaceous plant|herbs]] (frequently with the leaves aggregated toward the base), though a minority are woody [[shrub]]s  or small trees such as ''[[Bupleurum fruticosum]]''.&lt;ref name=Heywood&gt;{{cite book |first1=V.H. |last1=Heywood |first2=R.K. |last2=Brummitt |first3=A. |last3=Culham |first4=O. |last4=Seberg |title=Flowering plant families of the world |date=2007 |publisher=Firefly books |location=New York, U.S |isbn=9781554072064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|35}} Their leaves are of variable size and [[phyllotaxis|alternately arranged]], or with the upper leaves becoming nearly opposite. The leaves may be [[petiole (botany)|petiolate]] or sessile. There are no stipules but the petioles are frequently sheathing and the leaves may be perfoliate. The leaf blade is usually dissected, ternate or [[pinnation|pinnatifid]], but simple and entire in some genera, e.g. ''[[Bupleurum]]''.&lt;ref name=Stace/&gt; Commonly, their leaves emit a marked smell when crushed, aromatic to foetid, but absent in some species.

The defining characteristic of this family is the [[inflorescence]], the flowers nearly always aggregated in terminal [[umbel]]s, that may be simple or more commonly compound, often umbelliform cymes. The flowers are usually perfect ([[hermaphroditic]]) and [[Floral symmetry#Actinomorphic|actinomorphic]] but there may be [[Floral symmetry#Zygomorphic|zygomorphic]] petals at the edges of the umbel, as in carrot (''[[Daucus carota]]''). Some are [[plant sexual morphology|andromonoecious, polygamomonoecious, or even dioecious]] (as in ''[[Acronema]]''), with a distinct [[calyx (botany)|calyx]] and [[corolla (flower)|corolla]], but the calyx is often highly reduced, to the point of being undetectable in many species, while the corolla can be white, yellow, pink or purple. The flowers are nearly perfectly pentamerous, with five [[petal]]s, [[sepal]]s, and [[stamen]]s.
The [[androecium]] consists of five stamens, but there is often variation in the functionality of the stamens even within a single inflorescence. Some flowers are functionally staminate (where a pistil may be present but has no ovules capable of being fertilized) while others are functionally pistillate (where stamens are present but their anthers do not produce viable pollen). Pollination of one flower by the pollen of a different flower of the same plant ([[geitonogamy]]) is common. The [[gynoecium]] consists of two carpels fused into a single, bicarpellate pistil with an inferior ovary. Stylopodia support two styles and secrete nectar, attracting pollinators like flies, mosquitoes, gnats, beetles, moths, and bees. The fruit is a [[schizocarp]] consisting of two fused carpels that separate at maturity into two mericarps, each containing a single seed. The fruits of many species are dispersed by wind but others such as those of ''[[Daucus]]'' spp., are covered in bristles, which may be hooked in sanicle ''[[Sanicula europaea]]''&lt;ref name=Heywood/&gt; and thus catch in the fur of animals. The seeds have an oily [[endosperm]]&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;Watson, L., Dallwitz, M.J.

== Systematics ==

Apiaceae was first described by [[John Lindley]] in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;Lindley, J. (1836) An Introduction to the Natural System of Botany, 2nd Edition. Longman, London.&lt;/ref&gt; The name is derived from the type genus ''[[Apium]]'', which was originally used by [[Pliny the Elder]] circa 50 AD for a [[celery]]-like plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael G. Simpson|title=Plant Systematics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dj8KRImgyf4C|accessdate=14 April 2012|date=20 July 2010|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-374380-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative name for the family, Umbelliferae, derives from the [[inflorescence]] being generally in the form of a compound [[umbel]]. The family was one of the first to be recognized as a distinct group in Jacques Daleschamps' 1586 ''Historia generalis plantarum''. With [[Robert Morison|Robert Morison’s]] 1672 ''Plantarum umbelilliferarum distribution nova'' it became the first group of plants for which a systematic study was published.

The family is solidly placed within the [[Apiales]] order in the [[APG III system|APG III classification system]]. It is closely related to [[Araliaceae]] and the boundaries between these families remain unclear. Traditionally groups within the family have been delimited largely based on fruit [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], and the results from this have not been congruent with the more recent molecular [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] analyses. The subfamilial and tribal classification for the family is currently in a state of flux, with many of the groups being found to be grossly [[paraphyletic]] or [[polyphyletic]].&lt;ref name=Stevens/&gt;

=== Genera ===
{{Main|List of Apiaceae genera}}

According to the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Website]] {{As of|2014|July|lc=yes}} 434 genera are in the family Apiaceae.&lt;ref name=Stevens/&gt;

== Ecology ==
The black swallowtail butterfly, ''[[Papilio polyxenes]]'', uses the Apiaceae family for food and host plants for [[oviposition]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Donald W. 2011 &quot;Featured Creatures - Eastern Black Swallowtail.&quot; Entomology and Nematology Department, University of Florida. http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/bfly/bfly2/eastern_black_swallowtail.htm#life&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

Many members of this family are cultivated for various purposes. [[Parsnip]]s (''Pastinaca sativa''), carrots (''Daucus carota'') and [[Hamburg parsley#Root parsley|Hamburg parsley]] (''Petroselinum crispum''), produce [[tap root]]s that are large enough to be useful as food. Many species produce [[essential oil]]s in their leaves or fruits and as a result are flavourful aromatic herbs. Examples are [[parsley]] (''Petroselinum crispum''), [[coriander]] (''Coriandrum sativum''), [[culantro]], and [[dill]] (''Anethum graveolens''). The seeds may be used in cuisine, as with coriander (''Coriandrum sativum''), [[fennel]] (''Foeniculum vulgare''), [[cumin]] (''Cuminum cyminum''), and [[caraway]] (''Carum carvi'').

Other notable cultivated Apiaceae include [[chervil]] (''Anthriscus cerefolium''), [[angelica]] (''Angelica'' spp.), [[celery]] (''Apium graveolens''), [[arracacha]] (''Arracacia xanthorrhiza''), [[Eryngium maritimum|sea holly]] (''Eryngium'' spp.), [[asafoetida]] (''Ferula asafoetida''), [[galbanum]] (''Ferula gummosa''), [[cicely]] (''Myrrhis odorata''), [[anise]] (''Pimpinella anisum''), [[lovage]] (''Levisticum officinale''), and [[Hacquetia epipactis|hacquetia]] (''Hacquetia epipactis'').&lt;ref name=Watson/&gt;

=== Cultivation ===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
Generally, all members of this family are best cultivated in the cool-season garden; indeed, they may not grow at all if the soils are too warm.  Almost every widely cultivated plant of this group is a considered useful as a [[companion plant]]. One reason is because the tiny flowers clustered into umbels, are well suited for [[ladybug]]s, [[parasitic wasp]]s, and predatory [[flies]], which actually drink nectar when not reproducing. They then prey upon insect pests on nearby plants.  Some of the members of this family considered &quot;herbs&quot; produce scents that are believed to ...mask the odours of nearby plants, thus making them harder for insect pests to find.

=== Other uses ===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
The poisonous members of the Apiaceae have been used for a variety of purposes globally. The poisonous ''[[Water dropwort|Oenanthe crocata]]'' has been used to stupefy fish, ''[[Cicuta douglasii]]'' has been used as an aid in suicides, and [[arrow poison]]s have been made from various other family species.

''[[Daucus carota]]'' has been used as coloring for butter{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}.

''[[Dorema ammoniacum]]'', ''[[Ferula galbaniflua]]'', and ''[[Ferula sumbul]]'' are sources of [[incense]].

The woody [[Yareta|''Azorella compacta'' Phil.]] has been used in South America for fuel.

== Chemistry ==
Apiaceae vegetables including carrot, [[celery]], [[fennel]], [[parsley]] and [[parsnip]], contain [[polyyne]]s, an unusual class of organic compounds that show cytotoxic activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Polyacetylenes from the Apiaceae vegetables carrot, celery, fennel, parsley, and parsnip and their cytotoxic activities. |authors=C. Zidorn, K. Jöhrer, M. Ganzera, B. Schubert, E.M. Sigmund, J. Mader, R. Greil, E.P. Ellmerer and H. Stuppner |journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry |date=2005 |volume=53 |issue=7 |pages=2518–2523 |doi=10.1021/jf048041s }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minto, Robert E.; Blacklock, Brenda J “Biosynthesis and function of polyacetylenes and allied natural products” From Progress in Lipid Research 2008, vol. 47, 233-306. {{doi|10.1016/j.plipres.2008.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many species contain [[coumarin]]s or coumarin derivatives, such as [[furanocoumarin]]s.
