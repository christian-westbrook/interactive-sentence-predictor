'''Ānanda''' was a first cousin of [[Gautama Buddha]] and one of his [[the ten principal disciples|ten principal disciples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ananda — The Man Whom Everybody Liked|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-īlearning/buddhism/disciples09.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the Buddha's many disciples, Ānanda stood out for having the most retentive memory. Most of the [[sutra]]s of the ''[[Sutta Pitaka]]'' are attributed to his recollection of the Buddha's teachings during the [[First Buddhist council]]. For that reason, he was known as the ''Guardian of the Dharma''.

== Role in the Pali Canon ==
According to Buddhist tradition, every Buddha in the past and to come will have two chief disciples and one attendant during his ministry. In the case of [[Gautama Buddha]], the pair of disciples were [[Sariputta]] and [[Maudgalyayana]] and the attendant was Ānanda.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The word 'Ānanda' means [[wikt:bliss|'bliss']] in [[Pali]], [[Sanskrit]] as well as other Indian languages. It is a popular name in [[India]] and south-east Asia, especially [[Indonesia]].

In the Kannakatthala Sutta ([[Majjhima Nikaya|MN 90]]), Ananda is identified with the meaning of his name:
:Then King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One, &quot;Lord, what is the name of this monk?&quot;
:&quot;His name is Ananda, great king.&quot;
:&quot;What a joy he is! What a true joy!...&quot;

Ānanda was the first [[cousin]] of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] by their fathers, and was devoted to him. In the twentieth year of the Buddha's ministry, he became the Buddha's personal attendant, accompanying him on most of his wanderings and taking the part of [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]] in many of the recorded [[dialogues]]. He is the subject of a special [[panegyric]] delivered by the Buddha just before the Buddha's [[parinibbana]] (the [[Mahaparinibbana Sutta]] ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 16)); it is a panegyric for a man who is kindly, unselfish, popular, and thoughtful toward others.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Ānanda|volume=1|page=913|first=Thomas William|last=Rhys Davids|authorlink=Thomas Rhys Davids}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the long list of the disciples given in the [[Anguttara Nikaya]] (i. xiv.), where each of them is declared to be Prime in some quality, Ānanda is mentioned five times (more often than any other). He was named Prime in conduct, in service to others, and in power of [[memory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; The Buddha sometimes asked  Ānanda to substitute for him as teacher and then later stated that he himself would not have presented the teachings in any other way.

The Buddhist canon attributes the inclusion of women in the early Sangha (monastic order) to Ānanda. The Buddha conceded and permitted his step-mother [[Mahapajapati]] to be ordained as a [[bhikkhuni]] only after Ananda prevailed upon the Buddha to publicly recognize women as being equal to men in possessing the potential for awakening. Following the death of the Buddha, Ananda was criticized by the members of the Sangha for having enabled women to join the monastic order.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Social Dimensions of Early Buddhism&quot;&gt;[[Uma Chakravarti|Chakravarti, Uma]]. The Social Dimensions of Early Buddhism.  Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2015}}

==The First Council==
Because he attended the Buddha personally and often traveled with him, Ānanda overheard and memorized many of the discourses the Buddha delivered to various audiences. Therefore, he is often referred to as the disciple of the Buddha who &quot;heard much&quot;. At the [[Buddhist councils|First Buddhist Council]], convened shortly after the Buddha died, Ananda was called upon to recite many of the discourses that later became the [[Sutta Pitaka]] of the [[Pāli Canon]].

Despite his long association with and close proximity to the Buddha, Ananda was only a [[Sotapanna|stream-winner]] prior to the Buddha’s death. However, Buddha said that the purity of his heart was so great that, &quot;Should Ananda die without being fully liberated, he would be king of the Gods seven times because of the purity of his heart, or be king of the Indian subcontinent seven times. But....Ananda will experience final liberation in this very life.&quot; ([[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 3.80)

Prior to the First Buddhist Council, it was proposed that Ananda not be permitted to attend on the grounds that he was not yet an [[arahant]]. According to legend, this prompted Ananda to focus his efforts on the attainment of [[nibbana]] and he was able to reach the specified level of attainment before the convening of the conclave.

In contrast to most of the figures depicted in the [[Pāli Canon]], Ananda is presented as an imperfect, if sympathetic, figure. He mourns the deaths of both [[Sariputta]], with whom he enjoyed a close friendship, and the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. A verse of the [[Theragatha]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Olendzki|first=Andrew|title=Ananda Thera: Ananda Alone|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/thag/thag.17.03.olen.html|publisher=http://www.accesstoinsight.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; reveals his loneliness and isolation following the [[parinirvana]] (salvation/demise) of the Buddha.

In the [[Zen]] tradition, Ananda is considered to be the second Indian patriarch. He is often depicted with the Buddha alongside [[Mahakashyapa]], the first Indian patriarch.

Ananda attains [[parinirvana]] (salvation) in midair over the river [[Ganga]]. His body gets auto-cremated and his relics divide into four portions for the people of Rajargrha, the people of Vaisali, the [[Nāga|Nagas]] and the Gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Relics of the Buddha|author=John S. Strong|year=2007|pages=45–46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_KLAxmR8PZAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
