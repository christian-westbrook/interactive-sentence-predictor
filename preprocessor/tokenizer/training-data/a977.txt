&lt;!-- Definition &amp; symptoms--&gt;
'''Antimicrobial resistance''' ('''AMR''') is the ability of a microbe to resist the effects of medication previously used to treat them.&lt;ref name=ARM&gt;{{cite web|title=Review on Antimicrobial Resistance|url=http://amr-review.org/|website=amr-review.org|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO2014&gt;{{cite web |title=Antimicrobial resistance Fact sheet N°194|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs194/en/|website=who.int|accessdate=7 March 2015|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/about.html &quot;About Antimicrobial Resistance, CDC]&lt;/ref&gt;  This broader term also covers '''antibiotic resistance''', which applies to [[bacteria]] and [[antibiotic]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO2014&quot;/&gt; Resistance arises through one of three ways: natural resistance in certain types of bacteria, genetic [[mutation]], or by one species acquiring resistance from another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = General Background: About Antibiotic Resistance|url = http://www.tufts.edu/med/apua/about_issue/about_antibioticres.shtml|website = www.tufts.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resistance can appear spontaneously because of random mutations; or more commonly following gradual buildup over time, and because of [[antibiotic misuse|misuse of antibiotics or antimicrobials]].&lt;ref name=&quot;About Antimicrobial Resistance&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = About Antimicrobial Resistance|url = https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/about.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resistant microbes are increasingly difficult to treat, requiring alternative medications or higher doses, both of which may be more expensive or [[adverse effect|more toxic]].

&lt;!-- Epidemiology --&gt;
Rising drug resistance is caused mainly by improper use of antimicrobials in humans as well as in animals, and spread of resistant strains between the two.&lt;ref name=&quot;About Antimicrobial Resistance&quot;/&gt; Antibiotics increase [[selective pressure]] in bacterial populations, causing vulnerable bacteria to die; this increases the percentage of resistant bacteria which continue growing. With resistance to antibiotics becoming more common there is greater need for alternative treatments. Calls for new antibiotic therapies have been issued, but new drug development is becoming rarer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cassir|first1=N|last2=Rolain|first2=JM|last3=Brouqui|first3=P|title=A new strategy to fight antimicrobial resistance: the revival of old antibiotics.|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|date=2014|volume=5|pages=551|pmid=25368610|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2014.00551|pmc=4202707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- History &amp; economic costs --&gt;
A [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) report released April 2014 stated, &quot;this serious threat is no longer a prediction for the future, it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone, of any age, in any country. Antibiotic resistance—when bacteria change so antibiotics no longer work in people who need them to treat infections—is now a major threat to public health.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;who.int&quot;&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/amr-report/en/ &quot;WHO's first global report on antibiotic resistance reveals serious, worldwide threat to public health&quot;] Retrieved 2014-05-02&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing public calls for global collective action to address the threat include proposals for [[international treaty|international treaties]] on antimicrobial resistance.&lt;ref name=Hoffman /&gt; Worldwide antibiotic resistance is not fully mapped, but poorer countries with weak healthcare systems are more affected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swedish&quot;/&gt; According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]: &quot;Each year in the United States, at least 2 million people become infected with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics and at least 23,000 people die each year as a direct result of these infections.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple national and international monitoring programs for drug-resistant threats, including [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA), [[Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|vancomycin-resistant ''S. aureus'']] (VRSA), [[Beta-lactamase|extended spectrum beta-lactamase]] (ESBL), [[Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus|vancomycin-resistant ''Enterococcus'']] (VRE), [[Acinetobacter baumannii|multidrug-resistant ''A. baumannii'']] (MRAB).&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC2013&quot; /&gt;

The WHO defines antimicrobial resistance as a microorganism's resistance to an antimicrobial drug that was once able to treat an infection by that microorganism.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;
A person cannot become resistant to antibiotics. Resistance is a property of the microbe, not a person or other organism infected by a microbe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/antibiotic-use/antibiotic-resistance-faqs.html#antibiotic-resistance-concerns|title=CDC: Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work |publisher=Cdc.gov |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reasons for the widespread use of antibiotics include:

Improper use of antibiotics can often be attributed to the presence of [[structural violence]] in particular regions. Socioeconomic factors such as race and poverty affect accessibility of and adherence to drug therapy. The efficacy of treatment programs for drug-resistant strains depends on whether or not programmatic improvements take into account the effects of structural violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Farmer PE, Nizeye B, Stulac S, Keshavjee S |title=Structural violence and clinical medicine |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=3 |issue=10 |pages=e449 |year=2006 |pmid=17076568 |pmc=1621099 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030449 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Eighty percent of antibiotics sold in the United States are used on livestock. The majority of these antibiotics are given to animals that are otherwise healthy. Rather, it is normal practice to mix antibiotics with livestock food to promote healthier living conditions and to encourage animal growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Antibiotic Resistance {{!}} NRDC|url = http://www.nrdc.org/food/saving-antibiotics.asp|website = www.nrdc.org|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of antibiotics in animals is to a large degree involved in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Institute of Medicine (US) Forum on Emerging Infections |chapter=5 Factors Contributing to the Emergence of Resistance |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK97126/ |id=NBK97126 |editor=Knobler SL, Lemon SM, Najafi M, ''et al.'' |title=The Resistance Phenomenon in Microbes and Infectious Disease Vectors: Implications for Human Health and Strategies for Containment: Workshop Summary |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington DC |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-309-16830-4 |pages= |doi=10.17226/10651}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibiotics are used in food with the intention of not only preventing, controlling, and treating diseases, but also to promote growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;About Antimicrobial Resistance&quot;/&gt; Antibiotic use in animals can be classified into therapeutic, prophylactic, metaphylactic, and growth promotion uses of antibiotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/micro/en/amr.pdf |title=Joint FAO/OIE/WHO Expert Workshop on Non-Human Antimicrobial Usage and Antimicrobial Resistance: Scientific assessment |accessdate=2013-11-30 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040926123121/http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/micro/en/amr.pdf |archivedate=2004-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  All four patterns select for bacterial resistance, since antibiotic resistance is a natural evolutionary process, but the non-therapeutic uses expose larger number of animals, and therefore of bacteria, for more extended periods, and at lower doses. They therefore greatly increase the cross-section for the evolution of resistance.

This mirrors the primary concerns in human medicine, where, in general, researchers and doctors were more concerned about effective but non-toxic doses of drugs rather than antibiotic resistance.

In 2001, the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] estimated that greater than 70% of the antibiotics used in the U.S. are given to food animals (for example, chickens, pigs, and cattle), in the absence of disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheRealNews-2014-05-18&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ucsusa.org/food_and_environment/antibiotics_and_food/hogging-it-estimates-of-antimicrobial-abuse-in-livestock.html|title= Executive summary from the UCS report &quot;Hogging It: Estimates of Antimicrobial Abuse in Livestock&quot;|publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists|date=January 2001|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amounts given are termed &quot;sub-therapeutic&quot;, i.e., insufficient to combat disease. Despite no diagnosis of disease, the administration of these drugs (most of which are not significant to human medicine) results in decreased mortality and morbidity and increased growth in the animals so treated. It is theorized that sub-therapeutic dosages kills some, but not all, of the bacterial organisms in the animal — likely leaving those that are naturally antibiotic-resistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Henrik C. |last=Wegener |chapter=A15 Antibiotic Resistance—Linking Human and Animal Health |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK114485/ |id=NBK114485 |editor=Choffnes, E.R.; Relman, D.A.; Olsen, L.; Hutton, R.; Mack, A. |title=Antibiotic Resistance — Linking Human And Animal Health: Improving Food Safety Through a One Health Approach Workshop Summary |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington DC |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-309-25937-8 |pages= |doi=10.17226/13423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown, however, that, in essence, the overall population levels of bacteria are unchanged; only the mix of bacteria is affected.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The actual mechanism by which sub-therapeutic antibiotic feed additives serve as growth promoters is thus unclear. Some people have speculated that animals and fowl may have sub-clinical infections, which would be cured by low levels of antibiotics in feed, thereby allowing the creatures to thrive. No convincing evidence has been advanced for this theory, and the bacterial load in an animal is essentially unchanged by use of antibiotic feed additives. The mechanism of growth promotion is therefore probably something other than &quot;killing off the bad bugs&quot;.

In research studies, occasional animal-to-human spread of antibiotic-resistant organisms has been demonstrated.

Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with antibiotic waste, resistant bacteria follow, thus introducing antibiotic-resistant bacteria into the environment.

As bacteria replicate quickly, the resistant bacteria that enter the environment replicate their resistance genes as they continue to divide. In addition, bacteria carrying resistance genes have the ability to spread those genes to other species via horizontal gene transfer. Therefore, even if the specific antibiotic is no longer introduced into the environment, antibiotic-resistance genes will persist through the bacteria that have since replicated without continuous exposure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martinez, J.

===Duration of antibiotics===
Antibiotic treatment duration should be based on the infection and other health problems a person may have.&lt;ref name=NPS2013/&gt;&lt;!-- &quot;When optimising therapy for an infection consider the person’s immune status, the infecting agent and the focus of infection.&quot; --&gt; For many infections once a person has improved there is little evidence that stopping treatment causes more resistance.&lt;ref name=NPS2013/&gt;&lt;!--  &quot;There does not appear to be strong evidence to support the notion that stopping antibiotics before the end of the recommended treatment contributes to increasing resistance&quot; --&gt; Some therefore feel that stopping early may be reasonable in some cases.&lt;ref name=NPS2013/&gt;&lt;!--  &quot;Therefore, in selected cases, it may be appropriate to stop antibiotic therapy early.&quot; --&gt; Other infections, however, do require long courses regardless of whether a person feels better.&lt;ref name=NPS2013/&gt;&lt;!-- &quot;For some infections, such as Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia, enterococcal endocarditis or tuberculosis, clear evidence favours prolonged treatment to prevent relapse&quot; --&gt;

===Antibiotic usage===
The [[Netherlands]] has the lowest rate of antibiotic prescribing in the [[OECD]], at a rate of 11.4 defined daily doses (DDD) per 1,000 people per day in 2011. [[Germany]] and [[Sweden]] also have lower prescribing rates, with Sweden's rate having been declining since 2007. By contrast, [[Greece]], [[France]] and [[Belgium]] have high prescribing rates of more than 28 DDD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Indicator: Antibiotic prescribing|url=http://www.qualitywatch.org.uk/indicator/antibiotic-prescribing#vis-ref_585|website=QualityWatch|publisher=Nuffield Trust &amp; Health Foundation|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear if rapid viral testing affects antibiotic use in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Doan|first1=Q|last2=Enarson|first2=P|last3=Kissoon|first3=N|last4=Klassen|first4=TP|last5=Johnson|first5=DW|title=Rapid viral diagnosis for acute febrile respiratory illness in children in the Emergency Department.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=Sep 15, 2014|volume=9|pages=CD006452|pmid=25222468|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006452.pub4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About a third of antibiotic prescriptions written in [[Patient#Outpatients and inpatients|outpatient settings]] in the United States were not appropriate in 2010 and 2011. Doctors in the U.S. wrote 506 annual antibiotic scripts for every 1,000 people, with 353 being medically necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fleming-Dutra KE, Hersh AL, Shapiro DJ, Bartoces M, Enns EA, File TM, Finkelstein JA, Gerber JS, Hyun DY, Linder JA, Lynfield R, Margolis DJ, May LS, Merenstein D, Metlay JP, Newland JG, Piccirillo JF, Roberts RM, Sanchez GV, Suda KJ, Thomas A, Woo TM, Zetts RM, Hicks LA |title=Prevalence of Inappropriate Antibiotic Prescriptions Among US Ambulatory Care Visits, 2010-2011 |journal=JAMA |volume=315 |issue=17 |pages=1864–73 |year=2016 |pmid=27139059 |doi=10.1001/jama.2016.4151 |url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2016.4151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monitoring===
ResistanceOpen, an online global map of antimicrobial resistance developed by [[HealthMap]], displays aggregated data on antimicrobial resistance from publicly available and user submitted data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HealthMap ResistanceOpen|url=http://www.healthmap.org/resistanceopen/about/|publisher=HealthMap.org Boston Children’s Hospital|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scales|first1=David|title=Mapping Antibiotic Resistance: Know The Germs In Your Neighborhood|url=http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2015/12/antibiotic-resistance-data|website=WBUR|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website can display data for a 25-mile radius from a location. Users may submit data from [[antibiogram]]s for individual hospitals or laboratories. European data is from the EARS-Net (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network), part of the [[European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control|ECDC]].

=== Strategies ===
Excessive antibiotic use has become one of the top contributors to the development of antibiotic resistance. Since the beginning of the antibiotic era, antibiotics have been used to treat a wide range of disease.&lt;ref name=Andersson2011&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Andersson DI, Hughes D |title=Persistence of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations |journal=FEMS Microbiol. Rev. |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=901–11 |year=2011 |pmid=21707669 |doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2011.00289.x |url=https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article-lookup/doi/10.1111/j.1574-6976.2011.00289.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overuse of antibiotics has become the primary cause of rising levels of antibiotic resistance. The main problem is that doctors are willing to prescribe antibiotics to ill-informed individuals who believe that antibiotics can cure nearly all illnesses, including viral infections like the common cold. In an analysis of drug prescriptions, 36% of individuals with a cold or an upper respiratory infection (both viral in origin) were given prescriptions for antibiotics.&lt;ref name=Gilberg2003&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gilberg K, Laouri M, Wade S, Isonaka S |title=Analysis of medication use patterns:apparent overuse of antibiotics and underuse of prescription drugs for asthma, depression, and CHF |journal=J Manag Care Pharm |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=232–7 |year=2003 |pmid=14613466 |doi=10.18553/jmcp.2003.9.3.232 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.18553/jmcp.2003.9.3.232}}&lt;/ref&gt; These prescriptions accomplished nothing other than increasing the risk of further evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria.

In a recent years, [[antimicrobial stewardship]] teams in hospitals have encouraged optimal use of antimicrobials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Doron|first1=S|last2=Davidson|first2=LE|title=Antimicrobial stewardship.|journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings|date=November 2011|volume=86|issue=11|pages=1113–23|pmid=22033257|PMC=3203003|doi=10.4065/mcp.2011.0358|pmc=3203003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of antimicrobial stewardship are to help practitioners pick the right drug at the right dose and duration of therapy while preventing misuse and minimizing the development of resistance. Stewardship may reduce the length of stay by an average of slightly over 1 day while  not increasing the risk of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davey P, Marwick CA, Scott CL, Charani E, McNeil K, Gould IM, Ramsey CR, Michie S|title=Interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing practices for hospital inpatients|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|date=9 February 2017|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd003543.pub4|pmid=28178770|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003543.pub4/epdf/abstract|language=en|volume=2|page=CD003543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the volume of care provided in primary care (General Practice), recent strategies have focused on reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescribing in this setting. Simple interventions, such as written information explaining the futility of antibiotics for common infections such as upper respiratory tract infections, have been shown to reduce antibiotic prescribing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Sullivan|first1=JW|last2=Harvey|first2=RT|last3=Glasziou|first3=PP|last4=McCullough|first4=A|title=Written information for patients (or parents of child patients) to reduce the use of antibiotics for acute upper respiratory tract infections in primary care.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=25 November 2016|volume=11|pages=CD011360|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011360.pub2|pmid=27886368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been increasing public calls for global collective action to address the threat, including a proposal for international treaty on antimicrobial resistance. Further detail and attention is still needed in order to recognize and measure trends in resistance on the international level; the idea of a global tracking system has been suggested but implementation has yet to occur. A system of this nature would provide insight to areas of high resistance as well as information necessary for evaluation of programs and other changes made to fight or reverse antibiotic resistance.

On March 27, 2015, the White House released a comprehensive plan to address the increasing need for agencies to combat the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The Task Force for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria developed ''The National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria'' with the intent of providing a roadmap to guide the US in the antibiotic resistance challenge and with hopes of saving many lives. This plan outlines steps taken by the Federal government over the next five years needed in order to prevent and contain outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant infections; maintain the efficacy of antibiotics already on the market; and to help to develop future diagnostics, antibiotics, and vaccines.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehouse.gov&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = FACT SHEET: Obama Administration Releases National Action Plan to Combat Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria|url = https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/27/fact-sheet-obama-administration-releases-national-action-plan-combat-ant|website = whitehouse.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Action Plan was developed around five goals with focuses on strengthening health care, public health veterinary medicine, agriculture, food safety and research, and manufacturing. These goals, as listed by the White House, are as follows:
* Slow the Emergence of Resistant Bacteria and Prevent the Spread of Resistant Infections
* Strengthen National One-Health Surveillance Efforts to Combat Resistance
* Advance Development and use of Rapid and Innovative Diagnostic Tests for Identification and Characterization of Resistant Bacteria
* Accelerate Basic and Applied Research and Development for New Antibiotics, Other Therapeutics, and Vaccines
* Improve International Collaboration and Capacities for Antibiotic Resistance Prevention, Surveillance, Control and Antibiotic Research and Development
The following are goals set to meet by 2020:&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehouse.gov&quot;/&gt;
* Establishment of antimicrobial programs within acute care hospital settings
* Reduction of inappropriate antibiotic prescription and use by at least 50% in outpatient settings and 20% inpatient settings
* Establishment of State Antibiotic Resistance (AR) Prevention Programs in all 50 states
* Elimination of the use of medically important antibiotics for growth promotion in food-producing animals.

The World Health Organization has promoted the first World Antibiotic Awareness Week running from 16–22 November 2015. The aim of the week is to increase global awareness of antibiotic resistance. It also wants to promote the correct usage of antibiotics across all fields in order to prevent further instances of antibiotic resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Antibiotic Awareness Week|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/2015/world-antibiotic-awareness-week/event/en/|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the report, issued in January 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=J. H.|last2=Park|first2=K. S.|last3=Karim|first3=A. M.|last4=Lee|first4=C.-R.|last5=Lee|first5=S.

* Antibiotic stewardship to maintain the value of existing and future antibiotics
* The timing of prescription to use the effective antibiotics sooner rather than later
* To develop and approve ten new antibiotics by 2020
* Development of a molecular method for detecting antibiotic resistance genes
* To avoid the delay in distribution of US$2 billion global antibiotic resistance innovation fund.

====Vaccines====
Microorganisms do not develop resistance to [[vaccine]]s because a vaccine enhances the body's immune system, whereas an antibiotic operates separately from the body's normal defenses. Furthermore, if the use of vaccines increase, there is evidence that antibiotic resistant strains of pathogens will decrease; the need for antibiotics will naturally decrease as vaccines prevent infection before it occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Vaccines and antibiotic resistance|journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology|date = 2012-10-01|issn = 1879-0364|pmid = 22981392|pages = 596–602|volume = 15|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2012.08.002|first = Ravi P. N.|last = Mishra|first2 = Ernesto|last2 = Oviedo-Orta|first3 = Prachi|last3 = Prachi|first4 = Rino|last4 = Rappuoli|first5 = Fabio|last5 = Bagnoli}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, new strains that escape immunity induced by vaccines may [[Evolution|evolve]]; for example, an updated [[influenza vaccine]] is needed each year.

While theoretically promising, antistaphylococcal vaccines have shown limited efficacy, because of immunological variation between ''Staphylococcus'' species, and the limited duration of effectiveness of the antibodies produced. Development and testing of more effective vaccines is underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.homesteadschools.com/nursing/courses/Immunity/Chapter05.html |title=Immunity, Infectious Diseases, and Pandemics—What You Can Do |publisher=HomesteadSchools.com |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternating therapy====
Alternating therapy is a proposed method in which two or three antibiotics are taken in a rotation versus taking just one antibiotic such that bacteria resistant to one antibiotic are killed when the next antibiotic is taken. Studies have found that this method reduces the rate at which antibiotic resistant bacteria emerge in vitro relative to a single drug for the entire duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kim S, Lieberman TD, Kishony R | title = Alternating antibiotic treatments constrain evolutionary paths to multidrug resistance | journal = PNAS | volume = 111 | issue = 40 | pages = 14494–14499 | year=2014 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1409800111|bibcode = 2014PNAS..11114494K | pmid=25246554 | pmc=4210010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Development of new drugs====
Since the discovery of antibiotics, [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) efforts have provided new drugs in time to treat bacteria that became resistant to older antibiotics, but in the 2000s there has been concern that development has slowed enough that seriously ill people may run out of treatment options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wp.dh.gov.uk/publications/files/2013/03/CMO-Annual-Report-Volume-2-20111.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030190650/http://media.dh.gov.uk/network/357/files/2013/03/CMO-Annual-Report-Volume-2-20111.pdf |archivedate=30 October 2013 |title=Annual Report of the Chief Medical Officer - Infections and the rise of antimicrobial resistance |publisher=UK NHS |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern is that doctors may become reluctant to perform routine surgeries because of the increased risk of harmful infection.&lt;ref name=&quot;obama&quot; /&gt; Backup treatments can have serious side-effects; for example, treatment of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis can cause deafness or psychological disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/2013/06/04/188566805/moldova-grapples-with-whether-to-isolate-tb-patients |title=Moldova Grapples With Whether To Isolate TB Patients |publisher=NPR |date=4 June 2013 |accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The potential crisis at hand is the result of a marked decrease in industry R&amp;D.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Walsh |first=Fergus |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21737844 |title=BBC News&amp;nbsp;— Antibiotics resistance 'as big a risk as terrorism' – medical chief |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poor financial investment in antibiotic research has exacerbated the situation.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheRealNews-2014-05-18&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt; The pharmaceutical industry has little incentive to invest in antibiotics because of the high risk and because the potential financial returns are less likely to cover the cost of [[drug development|development]] than for other pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Nordrum, Amy | title = Antibiotic Resistance: Why Aren't Drug Companies Developing New Medicines to Stop Superbugs? | publisher = International Business Times | year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[Pfizer]], one of the last major pharmaceutical companies developing new antibiotics, shut down its primary research effort, citing poor shareholder returns relative to drugs for chronic illnesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;medpage&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last= Gever |first=John |url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/InfectiousDisease/GeneralInfectiousDisease/24708 |title=Pfizer Moves May Dim Prospect for New Antibiotics |publisher=MedPage Today |date=2011-02-04 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, small and medium-sized pharmaceutical companies are still active in antibiotic drug research.

In the United States, drug companies and the administration of President [[Barack Obama]] have been proposing changing the standards by which the FDA approves antibiotics targeted at resistant organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;obama&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/06/04/188380562/obama-administration-seeks-to-loosen-antibiotic-approvals |title=Obama Administration Seeks To Ease Approvals For Antibiotics |publisher=NPR |date=4 June 2013 |accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ledford H | title = FDA under pressure to relax drug rules | journal = Nature | volume = 492 | issue = 7427 | pages = 19 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23222585 | doi = 10.1038/492019a |bibcode = 2012Natur.492...19L }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 12 December 2013, the Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment (ADAPT) Act of 2013 was introduced in the [[U.S. Congress]]. The ADAPT Act aims to fast-track the drug development in order to combat the growing public health threat of 'superbugs'. Under this Act, the FDA can approve antibiotics and antifungals needed for life-threatening infections based on data from smaller clinical trials. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) will reinforce the monitoring of the use of antibiotics that treat serious and life-threatening infections and the emerging resistance, and make the data publicly available. The FDA antibiotics labeling process, 'Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Microbial Organisms' or 'breakpoints' is also streamlined to allow the most up-to-date and cutting-edge data available to healthcare professionals under the new Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://green.house.gov/press-release/green-gingrey-introduce-adapt-act-safeguard-public-health|title=Green, Gingrey Introduce ADAPT Act to Safeguard Public Health|author=Press Release|publisher=U.S. Congress|date=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/lifesciences/HR3742.pdf|title=Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment Act of 2013|publisher=U.S. Congress|date=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 September 2014 Obama signed an executive order&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/09/18/executive-order-combating-antibiotic-resistant-bacteria|title=Executive Order – Combating Antibiotics-Resistant Bacteria|author=Office of the Press Secretary|publisher=The White House|date=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to implement the recommendations proposed in a report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/PCAST/pcast_carb_report_sept2014.pdf|title=Report to the President on Combating Antibiotic Resistance|authors=President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology|publisher=PCAST|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology]] (PCAST) which outlines strategies to stream-line clinical trials and speed up the R&amp;D of new antibiotics.  Among the proposals:
* Create a 'robust, standing national clinical trials network for antibiotic testing' which will promptly enroll patients once identified to be suffering from dangerous bacterial infections.  The network will allow testing multiple new agents from different companies simultaneously for their safety and efficacy.
* Establish a 'Special Medical Use (SMU)' pathway for FDA to approve new antimicrobial agents for use in limited patient populations, shorten the approval timeline for new drug so patients with severe infections could benefit as quickly as possible.
* Provide economic incentives, especially for development of new classes of antibiotics, to offset the steep R&amp;D costs which drive away the industry to develop antibiotics.
The executive order also included a $20 million prize to encourage the development of diagnostic tests to identify highly resistant bacterial infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/antibiotics-rd-get-critical-lift-executive-order-obama-advisory-group/2014-09-19 |title=Antibiotics R &amp; D to get critical lift by executive order, Obama advisory group|author=Mullin, Emily|publisher=fiercebiotech.com|date=19 September 2014|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] plans to fund a new research network on the issue up to $62&amp;nbsp;million from 2013 to 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jun2013/niaid-03.htm NIH to fund clinical research network on antibacterial resistance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Using authority created by the [[Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act]] of 2006, the [[Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority]] in the U.S. [[Department of Health and Human Services]] announced that it will spend between $40&amp;nbsp;million and $200&amp;nbsp;million in funding for R&amp;D on new antibiotic drugs under development by [[GlaxoSmithKline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/news/Pages/strategic-alliance-130522.aspx|title=HHS forms strategic alliance to develop new antibiotics Approach provides a pipeline of new drugs rather than a single medical countermeasure|author=Press Release|publisher=Public Health Emergency, U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|date=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One major cause of antibiotic resistance is the increased pumping activity of microbial [[ABC transporters]], which diminishes the effective drug concentration inside the microbial cell. ABC transporter inhibitors that can be used in combination with current antimicrobials are being tested in clinical trials and are available for therapeutic regimens.&lt;ref name= Ponte-SucreA&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Ponte-Sucre |editor1-first=A | year=2009 |title=ABC Transporters in Microorganisms | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn= 978-1-904455-49-3}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{undue weight inline|date=March 2015}}

===Animal use===

====Europe====
In 1997, European Union health ministers voted to ban [[avoparcin]] and four additional antibiotics used to promote animal growth in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Casewell M, Friis C, Marco E, McMullin P, Phillips I |title=The European ban on growth-promoting antibiotics and emerging consequences for human and animal health |journal=J.

====United States====
The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) collect data on antibiotic use in humans and in a more limited fashion in animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;gao&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/330/323097.html|title=GAO-11-801, Antibiotic Resistance: Agencies Have Made Limited Progress Addressing Antibiotic Use in Animals|publisher=gao.gov|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The FDA first determined in 1977 that there is evidence of emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains in livestock. The long-established practice of permitting OTC sales of antibiotics (including penicillin and other drugs) to lay animal owners for administration to their own animals nonetheless continued in all states.
In 2000, the FDA announced their intention to revoke approval of [[fluoroquinolone]] use in poultry production because of substantial evidence linking it to the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant ''[[Campylobacter]]'' infections in humans. Legal challenges from the food animal and pharmaceutical industries delayed the final decision to do so until 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson-2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nelson JM, Chiller TM, Powers JH, Angulo FJ | title = Fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter species and the withdrawal of fluoroquinolones from use in poultry: a public health success story | journal = Clin Infect Dis | volume = 44 | issue = 7 | pages = 977–80 | date = Apr 2007 | pmid = 17342653 | doi = 10.1086/512369 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluroquinolones have been banned from extra-label use in food animals in the USA since 2007. However, they remain widely used in companion and exotic animals.

During 2007, two federal bills (S. 549&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s110-549|title=US Senate Bill S. 549: Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act of 2007|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and H.R. 962&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-962 |title=Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act of 2007|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;) aimed at phasing out &quot;nontherapeutic&quot; antibiotics in U.S. food animal production.

Growing U.S. consumer concern about using antibiotics in animal feed has led to greater availability of &quot;antibiotic-free&quot; animal products.  For example, chicken producer Perdue removed all human antibiotics from its feed and launched products labeled “antibiotic free” under the Harvestland brand in 2007. Consumer response was positive, and in 2014 Perdue also phased out ionophores from its hatchery and began using the “antibiotic free” labels on its Harvestland, Simply Smart, and Perfect Portions products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Perdue Sharply Cuts Antibiotic Use in Chickens and Jabs at Its Rivals|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/01/business/perdue-and-the-race-to-end-antibiotic-use-in-chickens.html|accessdate=August 12, 2015|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 31, 2015|author=Stephanie Strom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms==

[[File:mecA Resistance.svg|thumb|thumbtime=1:40|Diagram depicting antibiotic resistance through alteration of the antibiotic's target site, modeled after MRSA's resistance to penicillin. Beta-lactam antibiotics permanently inactivate [[Penicillin-binding protein|PBP enzymes]], which are essential for bacterial life, by permanently binding to their active sites. [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]], however, expresses a PBP that does not allow the antibiotic into its active site.]]

The four main mechanisms by which microorganisms exhibit resistance to antimicrobials are:
# Drug inactivation or modification: for example, enzymatic deactivation of [[Penicillin|''penicillin'' G]] in some penicillin-resistant bacteria through the production of [[Beta-lactamases|β-lactamases]]. The emergence of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens poses a serious threat to public health worldwide. ''Klebsiella pneumoniae'' carbapenemases (KPCs) and carbapenemases of the oxacillinase-48 (OXA-48) type have been reported worldwide. New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM) carbapenemases were originally identified in Sweden in 2008 and have spread worldwide rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=C.-R.|last2=Lee|first2=J.

N.p., 2004. Web. 28 Oct. 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Alteration of target- or binding site: for example, alteration of [[Penicillin binding protein|PBP]]—the binding target site of penicillins—in [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] and other penicillin-resistant bacteria. Another protective mechanism found among bacterial species is ribosomal protection proteins. These proteins protect the bacterial cell from antibiotics that target the cell’s ribosomes to inhibit protein synthesis. The mechanism involves the binding of the ribosomal protection proteins to the ribosomes of the bacterial cell, which in turn changes its conformational shape. This allows the ribosomes to continue synthesizing proteins essential to the cell while preventing antibiotics from binding to the ribosome to inhibit protein synthesis.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
# Alteration of metabolic pathway: for example, some [[sulfa drugs|sulfonamide]]-resistant bacteria do not require [[para-aminobenzoic acid]] (PABA), an important precursor for the synthesis of [[folic acid]] and [[nucleic acid]]s in bacteria inhibited by sulfonamides, instead, like mammalian cells, they turn to using preformed folic acid.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

[[File:Antibiotic resistance mechanisms.jpg|thumb|300x300px|A number of mechanisms used by common antibiotics to deal with bacteria and ways by which bacteria become resistant to them.]]

Antibiotic resistance can be a result of [[horizontal gene transfer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ochiai|first= K.|last2= Yamanaka|first2= T |last3=Kimura |first3=K |last4=Sawada|first4= O |year=1959|title= Inheritance of drug resistance (and its transfer) between Shigella strains and Between Shigella and E.coli strains|journal= Hihon Iji Shimpor |page= 1861|volume= 34|language= Japanese|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also of unlinked point mutations in the [[pathogen]] [[genome]] at a rate of about 1 in 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; per chromosomal replication. Mutations are rare but the fact that bacteria reproduce at such a high rate allows for the effect to be significant. A mutation may produce a change in the binding site of the antibiotic, which may allow the site to continue proper functioning in the presence of the antibiotic or prevent the binding of the antibiotic to the site altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cirz RT, Chin JK, Andes DR, de Crécy-Lagard V, Craig WA, Romesberg FE | title = Inhibition of Mutation and Combating the Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance | journal = PLoS Biol. | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = e176 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15869329 | pmc = 1088971 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030176 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antibiotic action against a pathogen can be seen as an environmental pressure. Those bacteria with a mutation that allows them to survive will reproduce, pass the trait to their offspring, which leads to the [[microevolution]] of a fully resistant colony. Chromosomal mutations providing antibiotic resistance benefit the bacteria but also confer a cost of fitness. For example, a ribosomal mutation may protect a bacterial cell by changing the binding site of an antibiotic but will also slow protein synthesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Criswell, Daniel 2004&quot;/&gt; manifesting, in slower growth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Levin BR, Perrot V, Walker N |title=Compensatory mutations, antibiotic resistance and the population genetics of adaptive evolution in bacteria |journal=Genetics |volume=154 |issue=3 |pages=985–97 |year=2000 |pmid=10757748 |pmc=1460977 |url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10757748}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Gram-negative bacteria, plasmid-mediated resistance genes produce proteins that can bind to [[DNA gyrase]], protecting it from the action of quinolones. Finally, mutations at key sites in DNA gyrase or [[topoisomerase IV]] can decrease their binding affinity to quinolones, decreasing the drug's effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Robicsek A, Jacoby GA, Hooper DC | title = The worldwide emergence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance | journal = Lancet Infect Dis | volume = 6 | issue = 10 | pages = 629–40 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17008172 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(06)70599-0 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antibiotic resistance can be introduced artificially into a microorganism through laboratory protocols, sometimes used as a [[selectable marker]] to examine the mechanisms of gene transfer or to identify individuals that absorbed a piece of DNA that included the resistance gene and another gene of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chan CX, Beiko RG, Ragan MA | title = Lateral Transfer of Genes and Gene Fragments in Staphylococcus Extends beyond Mobile Elements | journal = J Bacteriol | volume = 193 | issue = 15 | pages = 3964–3977 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21622749 | pmc = 3147504 | doi = 10.1128/JB.01524-10 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent findings show no necessity of large populations of bacteria for the appearance of antibiotic resistance. Small populations of E.coli in an antibiotic gradient can become resistant. Any heterogeneous environment with respect to nutrient and antibiotic gradients may facilitate antibiotic resistance in small bacterial populations. Researchers hypothesize that the mechanism of resistance development is based on four SNP mutations in the genome of E.coli produced by the gradient of antibiotic. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

=== NDM-1 ===
[[New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1|NDM-1]] is an [[enzyme]] that makes [[bacteria]] resistant to a broad range of [[beta-lactam antibiotic]]s.

NDM-1 was first detected in a ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'' isolate from a [[Sweden|Swedish]] patient of [[India]]n origin in 2008. It was later detected in bacteria in [[India]], [[Pakistan]], the [[United Kingdom]], the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/health/blog/2010/09/new_drug-resist.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.healthzone.ca/health/newsfeatures/article/850906 Canada] and [http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2010/09/08/japan_confirms_first_case_of_superbug_gene/ Japan].

According to A ''Lancet'' study, NDM-1 (New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase-1) originated in India. The study came to the conclusion that Indian hospitals are unsafe for treatment as [[Hospital-acquired infection|Nosocomial-infections]] are common and with the new super-bugs on rise in India, it can be dangerous.

==Organisms==

===Bacteria===

====''Staphylococcus aureus''====
{{Main article|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus}}

''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' (colloquially known as &quot;Staph aureus&quot; or a &quot;Staph infection&quot;) is one of the major resistant pathogens. Found on the [[mucous membrane]]s and the [[human skin]] of around a third of the population, it is extremely adaptable to antibiotic pressure. It was one of the earlier bacteria in which [[penicillin]] resistance was found—in 1947, just four years after the drug started being mass-produced. [[Methicillin]] was then the antibiotic of choice, but has since been replaced by [[oxacillin]] because of significant kidney toxicity. [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) was first detected in Britain in 1961, and is now &quot;quite common&quot; in hospitals{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}. MRSA was responsible for 37% of fatal cases of [[sepsis]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1999, up from 4% in 1991. Half of all ''S. aureus'' infections in the [[United States|US]] are resistant to penicillin, methicillin, [[tetracycline]] and [[erythromycin]].

This left [[vancomycin]] as the only effective agent available at the time. However, strains with intermediate (4–8&amp;nbsp;μg/ml) levels of resistance, termed glycopeptide-intermediate ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (GISA) or vancomycin-intermediate ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (VISA), began appearing in the late 1990s. The first identified case was in Japan in 1996, and strains have since been found in hospitals in England, France and the US. The first documented strain with complete (&gt;16&amp;nbsp;μg/ml) resistance to vancomycin, termed [[Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|vancomycin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (VRSA) appeared in the United States in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bozdogan B, Esel D, Whitener C, Browne FA, Appelbaum PC | title = Antibacterial susceptibility of a vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain isolated at the Hershey Medical Center | journal = Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy | volume = 52 | issue = 5 | pages = 864–868 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14563898 | doi = 10.1093/jac/dkg457 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2011, a variant of vancomycin has been tested that binds to the lactate variation and also binds well to the original target, thus reinstating potent antimicrobial activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Xie J, Pierce JG, James RC, Okano A, Boger DL | title = A Redesigned Vancomycin Engineered for Dual d-Ala-d-Ala and d-Ala-d-Lac Binding Exhibits Potent Antimicrobial Activity Against Vancomycin-Resistant Bacteria | journal = J.

A new class of antibiotics, [[Linezolid|oxazolidinones]], became available in the 1990s, and the first commercially available oxazolidinone, [[linezolid]], is comparable to vancomycin in effectiveness against MRSA. Linezolid resistance in ''S. aureus'' was reported in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tsiodras S, Gold HS, Sakoulas G, Eliopoulos GM, Wennersten C, Venkataraman L, Moellering RC, Ferraro MJ | title = Linezolid resistance in a clinical isolate of Staphylococcus aureus | journal = The Lancet | volume = 358 | issue = 9277 | pages = 207–208 | pmid = 11476839 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(01)05410-1 | date=July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; but infection rates have been at consistently low levels and in the United Kingdom and Ireland, no resistance was found in staphylococci collected from&amp;nbsp;[[bacteremia]]&amp;nbsp;cases between 2001 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=|title=Non-susceptibility trends among staphylococci from bacteraemias in the UK and Ireland, 2001– 06|url=http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/62/suppl_2/ii65.full.pdf|journal=Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) has now emerged as an epidemic that is responsible for rapidly progressive, fatal diseases, including necrotizing pneumonia, severe [[sepsis]], and [[necrotizing fasciitis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17146447&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boyle-Vavra S, Daum RS | title = Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: the role of Panton-Valentine leukocidin | journal = Lab.

Outbreaks of CA-MRSA infections have been reported in correctional facilities, among athletic teams, among military recruits, in newborn nurseries, and among men that have sex with men.

====''Streptococcus'' and ''Enterococcus''====
''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' (Group A ''Streptococcus'': GAS) infections can usually be treated with many different antibiotics. Early treatment may reduce the risk of death from invasive group A streptococcal disease. However, even the best medical care does not prevent death in every case. For those with very severe illness, supportive care in an intensive-care unit may be needed. For persons with necrotizing fasciitis, surgery often is needed to remove damaged tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=CDCP |title=Group A Streptococcal (GAS) Disease (strep throat, necrotizing fasciitis, impetigo) – Frequently Asked Questions |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/groupastreptococcal_g.htm |date=2005-10-11 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=2007-12-11|ref=harv| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071219224215/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/groupastreptococcal_g.htm| archivedate= 19 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strains of ''S. pyogenes'' resistant to [[macrolide]] antibiotics have emerged; however, all strains remain uniformly susceptible to [[penicillin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15109426&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Albrich WC, Monnet DL, Harbarth S | title = Antibiotic selection pressure and resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes | journal = Emerg.

Resistance of ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' to penicillin and other beta-lactams is increasing worldwide. The major mechanism of resistance involves the introduction of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. Selective pressure is thought to play an important role, and use of beta-lactam antibiotics has been implicated as a risk factor for infection and colonization.

====''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''====
''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' is a highly prevalent [[opportunistic pathogen]]. One of the most worrisome characteristics of ''P. aeruginosa'' is its low antibiotic susceptibility, which is attributable to a concerted action of [[efflux (microbiology)|multidrug efflux pumps]] with chromosomally encoded antibiotic resistance genes (e.g., ''mexAB-oprM'', ''mexXY'') and the low permeability of the bacterial cellular envelopes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poole2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Poole K | title = Efflux-mediated multiresistance in Gram-negative bacteria | journal = Clinical Microbiology and Infection | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–26 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14706082 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-0691.2004.00763.x | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' has the ability to produce 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (HAQs) and it has been found that HAQs have prooxidant effects, and overexpressing modestly increased susceptibility to antibiotics.

According to a 2015 CDC report, ''C. difficile'' caused almost 500,000 infections in the United States over a year period. Associated with these infections were an estimated 15,000 deaths. The CDC estimates that ''C. difficile'' infection costs could amount to $3.8 billion over a 5-year span.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2015/p0225-clostridium-difficile.html|title=CDC Press Releases|website=CDC|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research suggests the overuse of antibiotics in the raising of livestock is contributing to outbreaks of bacterial infections such as C. difficile.[16]

Antibiotics, especially those with a broad activity spectrum (such as clindamycin) disrupt normal intestinal flora. This can lead to an overgrowth of C. difficile, which flourishes under these conditions. Pseudomembranous colitis can follow, creating generalized inflammation of the colon and the development of &quot;pseudomembrane&quot;, a viscous collection of inflammatory cells, fibrin, and necrotic cells.[4] [[Clindamycin]]-resistant ''C. difficile'' was reported as the causative agent of large outbreaks of diarrheal disease in hospitals in New York, Arizona, Florida and Massachusetts between 1989 and 1992.&lt;ref name=Johnson1999&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson S, Samore MH, Farrow KA, Killgore GE, Tenover FC, Lyras D, Rood JI, DeGirolami P, Baltch AL, Rafferty ME, Pear SM, Gerding DN | title = Epidemics of diarrhea caused by a clindamycin-resistant strain of ''Clostridium difficile'' in four hospitals | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 341 | issue = 23 | pages = 1645–1651 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10572152 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199911253412203 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographically dispersed outbreaks of ''C. difficile'' strains resistant to [[fluoroquinolone]] antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, were also reported in North America in 2005.&lt;ref name=Loo_2005&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Loo VG, Poirier L, Miller MA, Oughton M, Libman MD, Michaud S, Bourgault AM, Nguyen T, Frenette C, Kelly M, Vibien A, Brassard P, Fenn S, Dewar K, Hudson TJ, Horn R, René P, Monczak Y, Dascal A | title = A predominantly clonal multi-institutional outbreak of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea with high morbidity and mortality | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 353 | issue = 23 | pages = 2442–9 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16322602 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa051639 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae ====
As of 2013 hard-to-treat or untreatable infections of [[Carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae|carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae]] (CRE) were increasing among patients in medical facilities.  CRE are resistant to nearly all available antibiotics.  Almost half of hospital patients who get bloodstream CRE infections die from the infection.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC2013&quot;/&gt;

==== Multidrug-resistant ''Acinetobacter'' ====
''Acinetobacter'' is a gram-negative bacteria that causes pneumonia or bloodstream infections in critically ill patients. [[Acinetobacter#Treatment|Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter]] have become very resistant to antibiotics.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC2013&quot;/&gt;

==== Drug-resistant ''Campylobacter'' ====
''[[Campylobacter]]'' causes diarrhea (often bloody), fever, and abdominal cramps. Serious complications such as temporary paralysis can also occur. Physicians rely on [[ciprofloxacin]] and [[azithromycin]] for treating patients with severe disease although ''Campylobacter'' is showing resistance to these antibiotics.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC2013&quot; /&gt;

====''Salmonella'' and ''E. coli''====
Infection with ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Salmonella]]'' can result from the consumption of contaminated food and [[Water pollution|polluted water]]. Both of these bacteria are well known for causing nosocomial (hospital-linked) infections, and often, these strains found in hospitals are antibiotic resistant because of adaptations to wide spread antibiotic use.&lt;ref name=Davies2010&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Davies J, Davies D | title = Origins and Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance | journal = Microbiol Mol Biol Rev | volume = 74 | issue = 3 | pages = 417–433 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20805405 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.00016-10 | ref = harv | pmc=2937522}}&lt;/ref&gt; When both bacteria are spread, serious health conditions arise. Many people are hospitalized each year after becoming infected, with some dying as a result. Since 1993, some strains of  ''E. coli'' have become resistant to multiple types of [[quinolone antibiotic|fluoroquinolone antibiotics]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Although mutation alone plays a huge role in the development of antibiotic resistance, a 2008 study found that high survival rates after exposure to antibiotics could not be accounted for by mutation alone.&lt;ref name=Adam2008&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Adam M, Murali B, Glenn NO, Potter SS |title=Epigenetic inheritance based evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria |journal=BMC Evol.

The researchers found that some antibiotic resistance in E. coli developed because of epigenetic inheritance rather than by direct inheritance of a mutated gene. This was further supported by data showing that reversion to antibiotic sensitivity was relatively common as well. This could only be explained by epigenetics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adam2008&quot;/&gt; [[Epigenetics]] is a type of inheritance in which gene expression is altered rather than the genetic code itself. There are many modes by which this alteration of gene expression can occur, including [[DNA methylation|methylation of DNA]] and [[Histone|histone modification]]; however, the important point is that both inheritance of random mutations and epigenetic markers can result in the expression of antibiotic resistance genes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adam2008&quot;/&gt;

====''Mycobacterium tuberculosis''====
[[Tuberculosis]] is increasing across the globe, especially in developing countries, over the past few years. TB resistant to antibiotics is called [[Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis|MDR TB]] (Multidrug Resistant TB).

TB was considered one of the most prevalent diseases, and did not have a cure until the discovery of [[Streptomycin]] by [[Selman Waksman]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Herzog H | title = History of Tuberculosis | journal = Respiration | volume = 65 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–15 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9523361 | doi = 10.1159/000029220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the bacteria soon developed resistance. Since then, drugs such as [[isoniazid]] and [[rifampin]] have been used. M. tuberculosis develops resistance to drugs by spontaneous mutations in its genomes. Resistance to one drug is common, and this is why treatment is usually done with more than one drug. [[Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis|Extensively Drug-Resistant TB]] (XDR TB) is TB that is also resistant to the second line of drugs.&lt;ref name=&quot;journals.lww.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ddmec.2010.09.006 |title=Transmission of MDR tuberculosis |year=2010 |last1=Gao |first1=Qian |last2=Li |first2=Xia |journal=Drug Discovery Today: Disease Mechanisms |volume=7 |pages=e61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Antibiotic resistance in gonorrhea}}
[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]] is a sexually transmitted pathogen that causes [[gonorrhea]], a sexually transmitted disease that can result in discharge and inflammation at the urethra, cervix, pharynx, or rectum.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC2013&quot; /&gt; It can cause pelvic pain, pain on urination, penile and vaginal discharge, as well as systemic symptoms.

In the 1940s effective treatment with [[penicillin]] became available, but by the 1970s resistant strains predominated. Resistance to penicillin has developed through two mechanisms: chromasomally mediated resistance (CMRNG) and penicillinase-mediated resistance (PPNG). CMRNG involves step wise mutation of penA, which codes for the [[Penicillin binding proteins|penicillin-binding protein]] (PBP-2); mtr, which encodes an [[Efflux (microbiology)|efflux pump]] that removes penicillin from the cell; and penB, which encodes the bacterial cell wall [[Porin (protein)|porins]]. PPNG involves the acquisition of a [[Plasmid-mediated resistance|plasmid-borne]] [[beta-lactamase]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tapsall 2001&quot;&gt;Tapsall (2001) Antimicrobial resistance in ''Niesseria gonorrhoeae''.

====''Mycoplasma genitalium''====
''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' is a small pathogenic bacterium that lives on the ciliated epithelial cells of the urinary and genital tracts in humans. It is still controversial whether or not this bacterium is to be recognized as a sexually transmitted pathogen. Infection with ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' sometimes produces clinical symptoms, or a combination of symptoms, but sometimes can be asymptomatic. It causes inflammation in the [[urethra]] ([[urethritis]]) both in men and women, which is associated with [[mucopurulent discharge]] in the urinary tract, and burning while urinating.

Treatment of ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' infections is becoming increasingly difficult due to rapidly developing multi-drug resistance, and diagnosis and treatment is further hampered by the fact that ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' infections are not routinely detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suneta |first1=Soni |last2=Parkhouse |first2=Andy |last3=Gillian |first3=Dean  |date=24 April 2017 |title=Macrolide and quinolone-resistant ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' in a man with persistent urethritis: the tip of the British iceberg? |journal=Sexually Transmitted Infections |pages=sextrans-2016-053077 |doi=10.1136/sextrans-2016-053077 |access-date=13 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Azithromycin is the most common first-line treatment, but the commonly-used 1 gram single-dose azithromycin treatment can lead to the bacteria commonly developing resistance to azithromycin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yew|first1=H.

===Viruses===
Specific [[antiviral drug]]s are used to treat some viral infections. These drugs prevent viruses from reproducing by inhibiting essential stages of the virus's replication cycle in infected cells. Antivirals are used to treat [[HIV]], [[hepatitis B]], [[hepatitis C]], [[influenza]], [[herpesviridae|herpes viruses]] including [[varicella zoster virus]], [[cytomegalovirus]] and [[Epstein-Barr virus]].

Of particular note, [[Fluconazole]]-resistant Candida species have been highlighted as a growing problem by the CDC.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC2013&quot; /&gt; More than 20 Candida species of Candida can cause [[Candidiasis]] infection, the most common of which is ''[[Candida albicans]]''. Candida yeasts normally inhabit the skin and mucous membranes without causing infection. However, overgrowth of Candida can lead to Candidiasis. Some Candida strains are becoming resistant to first-line and second-line [[Antifungal|antifungal agents]] such as [[Azole#Use as anti-fungal agents|azoles]] and [[echinocandin]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC2013&quot; /&gt;

===Parasites===

The [[protozoa]]n parasites that cause the diseases [[malaria]], [[trypanosomiasis]], [[toxoplasmosis]], [[cryptosporidiosis]] and [[leishmaniasis]] are important human pathogens.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid25057459&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 25057459| pmc = 4095053| year = 2014| last1 = Andrews| first1 = K.

Malarial parasites that are resistant to the drugs that are currently available to infections are common and this has led to increased efforts to develop new drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 25110058| year = 2014| author1 = Visser| first1 = B.

[[Leishmaniasis]] is caused by protozoa and is an important public health problem worldwide, especially in sub-tropical and tropical countries. Drug resistance has &quot;become a major concern&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 25287721| year = 2014| author1 = Mansueto| first1 = P| title = Leishmaniasis in travelers: A literature review| journal = Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease| volume = 12| issue = 6PA| pages = 563–581| last2 = Seidita| first2 = A| last3 = Vitale| first3 = G| last4 = Cascio| first4 = A| doi = 10.1016/j.tmaid.2014.09.007| hdl = 10447/101959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2015}}
Antibiotic resistance is an important tool for [[genetic engineering]]. By constructing a [[plasmid]] that contains an antibiotic-resistance gene as well as the gene being engineered or expressed, a researcher can ensure that, when bacteria replicate, only the copies that carry the plasmid survive. This ensures that the gene being manipulated passes along when the bacteria replicates.

In general, the most commonly used antibiotics in genetic engineering are &quot;older&quot; antibiotics. These include:
* [[ampicillin]]
* [[kanamycin]]
* [[tetracycline]]
* [[chloramphenicol]]

In industry, the use of antibiotic resistance is disfavored, since maintaining bacterial cultures would require feeding them large quantities of antibiotics. Instead, the use of [[auxotrophic]] bacterial strains (and function-replacement plasmids) is preferred.

==Society and culture==
For the [[fiscal year]] 2016 budget, President Obama has suggested to nearly double the amount of federal funding to &quot;combat and prevent&quot; antibiotic resistance to more than $1.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/27/fact-sheet-president-s-2016-budget-proposes-historic-investment-combat-a President’s 2016 Budget Proposes Historic Investment to Combat Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria to Protect Public Health] The White House, Office of the Press Secretary, January 27, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Many international funding agencies like USAID, DFID, SIDA and Bill &amp; Melinda Gates foundation has pledged money for developing strategies to counter antimicrobial resistance.

Since the mid-1980s pharmaceutical companies have invested in medications for cancer or chronic disease that have greater potential to make money and have &quot;de-emphasized or dropped development of antibiotics&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_jan_21_2016&quot; /&gt; On January 20, 2016 at the [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]], more than &quot;80 pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies&quot; from around the world called for 'transformational commercial models' at a global level to spur research and development on antibiotics and on the &quot;enhanced use of diagnostic tests that can rapidly identify the infecting organism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_jan_21_2016&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/business/to-fight-superbugs-drug-makers-call-for-incentives-to-develop-antibiotics.html?smid=tw-share | title=To Fight ‘Superbugs,’ Drug Makers Call for Incentives to Develop Antibiotics | publisher=New York Times | date=20 January 2016 | accessdate=24 January 2016 | author=Pollack, Andrew |series=Davos 2016 Special Report |location=Davos, Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal frameworks===
Some global health scholars have argued that a global, legal framework is needed to prevent and control antimicrobial resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;A. Behdinan, S.J.
