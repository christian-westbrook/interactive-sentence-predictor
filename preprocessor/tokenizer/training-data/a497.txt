It covered the entire Indian subcontinent except for parts of present-day [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Kerala]]. The empire's capital was [[Pataliputra]] (in [[Magadha]], present-day [[Patna]]), with provincial capitals at [[Taxila]] and [[Ujjain]].

In about 260 BCE, Ashoka waged a destructive war against the state of [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] (modern [[Odisha]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Jerry Bentley 1993&quot;&gt;Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 44.&lt;/ref&gt; He conquered Kalinga, which none of his ancestors had done.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] had been conquered by the preceding [[Nanda Dynasty]] but subsequently broke free until it was reconquered by Ashoka c. 260 BCE. (Raychaudhuri, H. C.; Mukherjee, B. N. 1996. ''Political History of Ancient India: From the Accession of Parikshit to the Extinction of the Gupta Dynasty''. Oxford University Press, pp. 204-9, pp. 270-71)&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars suggest he belonged to the [[Jainism|Jain]] tradition, but it is generally accepted that he embraced [[Buddhism]].{{sfn|Mookerji|1995|p=60}} Legends state he converted after witnessing the mass deaths of the [[Kalinga War]], which he himself had waged out of a desire for conquest. &quot;Ashoka reflected on the war in Kalinga, which reportedly had resulted in more than 100,000 deaths and 150,000 deportations, ending at around 200,000 deaths.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Ashoka converted to Buddhism about 263 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jerry Bentley 1993&quot;/&gt; He is remembered for the Ashoka pillars and edicts, for sending Buddhist monks to [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Central Asia]], and for establishing monuments marking several significant sites in the life of [[Gautama Buddha]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'', New York, Oxford University Press, 1993, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], biographical information about him relies on legends written centuries later, such as the 2nd-century CE ''[[Ashokavadana]]'' (&quot;''Narrative of Ashoka''&quot;, a part of the ''[[Divyavadana]]''), and in the Sri Lankan text ''[[Mahavamsa]]'' (&quot;''Great Chronicle''&quot;). The emblem of the modern [[Republic of India]] is an adaptation of the [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]]. Ashoka's name &quot;{{IAST|Aśoka}}&quot; means &quot;painless, without sorrow&quot; in [[Sanskrit]] (the [[a privativum|''a'' privativum]] and ''śoka'', &quot;pain, distress&quot;). In his [[Edicts of Ashoka|edicts]], he is referred to as ''{{IAST|Devānāmpriya}}'' (Pali ''{{IAST|Devānaṃpiya}}'' or &quot;the Beloved of the Gods&quot;), and ''{{IAST|Priyadarśin}}'' (Pali ''{{IAST|Piyadasī}}'' or &quot;He who regards everyone with affection&quot;). His fondness for his name's connection to the ''[[Saraca asoca]]'' tree, or  &quot;Ashoka tree&quot;, is also referenced in the [[Ashokavadana]]. [[H.G. Wells]] wrote of Ashoka in his book ''[[The Outline of History]]'': &quot;Amidst the tens of thousands of names of monarchs that crowd the columns of history, their majesties and graciousnesses and serenities and royal highnesses and the like, the name of Ashoka shines, and shines, almost alone, a star.&quot;

==Biography==

===Ashoka's early life===
Ashoka was born to the [[Mauryan]] emperor, [[Bindusara]] and [[Subhadrangī]] (or Dharmā).&lt;ref&gt;John S. Strong, ''The Legend of King Ashoka'' (New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 2014), 17.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the grandson of [[Chandragupta Maurya]], founder of the Maurya dynasty. Broadly, Chandragupta was born in a humble family, abandoned, raised as a son by another family, then with the training and counsel of [[Chanakya]] of ''[[Arthashastra]]'' fame ultimately built one of the largest empires in ancient India.&lt;ref name=britchandrag&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Chandragupta Chandragupta Maurya, EMPEROR OF INDIA], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothermund2004p63&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hermann Kulke|author2=Dietmar Rothermund|title=A History of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RoW9GuFJ9GIC |year=2004|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-32920-0|pages=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Roger Boesche|author=Roger Boesche|title=The First Great Political Realist: Kautilya and His Arthashastra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K85NA7Rg67wC |year=2003|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-0607-5|pages=7–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashoka's grandfather Chandragupta renounced it all, and became a monk in the [[Jainism|Jain]] tradition.&lt;ref name=jonesryanxxviii/&gt; According to Roman historian [[Appian]], Chandragupta had made a &quot;marital alliance&quot; with [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]]; there is thus a possibility that Ashoka had a [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] Greek grandmother.&lt;ref&gt;The Early State, H. J. M. Claessen, Peter Skalník, Walter de Gruyter, 1978 [https://books.google.fr/books?id=sMoLhNQ9KRoC&amp;pg=PA393]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Brief History of India, Alain Daniélou, Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co, 2003, p.86-87 [https://books.google.fr/books?id=Kwnv3I6qIosC&amp;pg=PA86]&lt;/ref&gt; An Indian [[Puranic]] source, the [[Pratisargaparvan|Pratisarga Parva]] of the [[Bhavishya Purana]], also described the marriage of Chandragupta with a Greek (&quot;[[Yavana]]&quot;) princess, daughter of Seleucus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sagar&quot;&gt;Foreign Influence on Ancient India, Krishna Chandra Sagar, Northern Book Centre, 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0UA4rkm9MgkC&amp;pg=PA83 p.83]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain texts provide varying biographical accounts. The [[Avadana]] texts mention that his mother was queen Subhadrangī. According to the [[Ashokavadana]], she was the daughter of a Brahmin from the city of Champa.{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2008|p=332}}&lt;ref name=&quot;John1989&quot;/&gt;{{rp|205}} She gave him the name Ashoka, meaning &quot;one without sorrow&quot;. The [[Divyavadana|''Divyāvadāna'']] tells a similar story, but gives the name of the queen as Janapadakalyānī.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A text book of the history of Theravāda Buddhism | author = K.

The Buddhist text ''[[Divyavadana]]'' describes Ashoka putting down a revolt due to activities of wicked ministers. This may have been an incident in [[Bindusara]]'s times. [[Taranatha]]'s account states that [[Chanakya]], Bindusara's chief advisor, destroyed the nobles and kings of 16 towns and made himself the master of all territory between the eastern and the western seas. Some historians consider this as an indication of Bindusara's conquest of the Deccan while others consider it as suppression of a revolt. Following this, Ashoka was stationed at [[Ujain]], the capital of [[Malwa]], as governor.{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2008|p=332}}

Bindusara's death in 272 BCE led to a war over succession. According to the ''Divyavadana'', Bindusara wanted his elder son [[Susima]] to succeed him but Ashoka was supported by his father's ministers, who found Susima to be arrogant and disrespectful towards them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swarup1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Gyan Swarup Gupta | title=India: From Indus Valley Civilisation to Mauryas | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jbjT9GG__nEC&amp;pg=PA268 | accessdate=30 October 2012 | date=1 January 1999 | publisher=Concept Publishing Company | isbn=978-81-7022-763-2 | pages=268–}}&lt;/ref&gt; A minister named Radhagupta seems to have played an important role in Ashoka's rise to the throne. The Ashokavadana recounts Radhagupta's offering of an old royal elephant to Ashoka for him to ride to the Garden of the Gold Pavilion where King Bindusara would determine his successor. Ashoka later got rid of the legitimate heir to the throne by tricking him into entering a pit filled with live coals. Radhagupta, according to the Ashokavadana, would later be appointed prime minister by Ashoka once he had gained the throne. The ''[[Dipavansa]]'' and ''[[Mahavansa]]'' refer to Ashoka's killing 99 of his brothers, sparing only one, named [[Vitashoka]] or Tissa,{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2008|p=331}} although there is no clear proof about this incident (many such accounts are saturated with mythological elements). The [[coronation]] happened in 269 BCE, four years after his succession to the throne.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

[[File:Emperor Ashoka and his Queen at the Deer Park.jpg|thumb|Emperor Ashoka and his Queen at the [[Sarnath|Deer Park]]. [[Sanchi]] relief.]]
Buddhist legends state that Ashoka was bad-tempered and of a wicked nature. He built [[Ashoka's Hell]], an elaborate [[torture chamber]] described as a &quot;Paradisal Hell&quot; due to the contrast between its beautiful exterior and the acts carried out within by his appointed executioner, Girikaa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pradip2002&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Pradip Bhattacharya |title=The Unknown Ashoka | url=http://www.boloji.com/index.cfm?md=Content&amp;sd=Articles&amp;ArticleID=758 | accessdate=30 November 2012 | year=2002 | publisher=Boloji.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This earned him the name of ''Chanda Ashoka'' ({{IAST|Caṇḍa Aśoka}}) meaning &quot;Ashoka the Fierce&quot; in Sanskrit. Professor Charles Drekmeier cautions that the Buddhist legends tend to dramatise the change that Buddhism brought in him, and therefore, exaggerate Ashoka's past wickedness and his piousness after the conversion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charles1962&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Charles Drekmeier | title=Kingship and Community in Early India | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmurAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA173 | accessdate=30 October 2012 | year=1962 | publisher=Stanford University Press | isbn=978-0-8047-0114-3 | pages=173–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ascending the throne, Ashoka expanded his empire over the next eight years, from the present-day [[Assam]] in the East to [[Balochistan]] in the West; from the [[Pamir Knot]] in Afghanistan in the north to the peninsula of southern India except for present day [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]] which were ruled by the three [[Sangam period|ancient]] [[Tamil people|Tamil]] kingdoms.{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2008|p=333}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=YgAp2MuMR84C&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=mauryan+empire+balochistan&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IufwVIaPOILAOb3BgWg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg|title=The Truth of Babri Mosque|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conquest of Kalinga===
{{Main article|Kalinga War}}
While the early part of Ashoka's reign was apparently quite bloodthirsty, he became a follower of the [[Buddha]]'s teachings after his conquest of [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] on the east coast of India in the present-day states of [[Odisha]] and North Coastal [[Andhra Pradesh]]. Kalinga was a state that prided itself on its sovereignty and democracy. With its monarchical parliamentary democracy it was quite an exception in ancient Bharata where there existed the concept of [[Rajdharma]]. Rajdharma means the duty of the rulers, which was intrinsically entwined with the concept of bravery and dharma. The Kalinga War happened  eight years after his coronation. From his 13th inscription, we come to know that the battle was a massive one and caused the deaths of more than 100,000 soldiers and many civilians who rose up in defence; over 150,000 were deported.&lt;ref&gt;prachin bharater itihas by sunil chattopadhyay&lt;/ref&gt; When he was walking through the grounds of Kalinga after his conquest, rejoicing in his victory, he was moved by the number of bodies strewn there and the wails of the bereaved.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

===Marriage===
From the various sources that speak of his life, Ashoka is believed to have had five wives. They were named [[Devi (Ashoka's wife)|Devi]] (or Vedisa-Mahadevi-Shakyakumari), the second queen, [[Karuvaki]], [[Asandhimitra]] (designated ''{{IAST|agramahisī}}'' or &quot;chief queen&quot;), [[Padmavati (wife of Ashoka)|Padmavati]], and [[Tishyarakshita]].{{sfn|Mookerji|1995|p=9}} He is similarly believed to have had four sons and two daughters: a son by Devi named Mahendra ([[Pali]]: ''Mahinda''), Tivara (son of Karuvaki), Kunala (son of [[Padmavati (wife of Ashoka)|Padmavati]], and Jalauka (mentioned in the [[Rajatarangini|Kashmir Chronicle]]), a daughter of Devi named [[Sanghamitra]] ([[Pali]]: ''Sanghamitta''), and another daughter named Charumati.{{sfn|Mookerji|1995|p=9}}

According to one version of the ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', the Buddhist chronicle of [[Sri Lanka]], Ashoka, when he was heir-apparent and was journeying as Viceroy to [[Ujjain]], is said to have halted at [[Vidisha]] (10 kilometers from [[Sanchi]]), and there married the daughter of a local banker. She was called [[Devi (wife of Ashoka)|Devi]] and later gave Ashoka two sons, Ujjeniya and [[Mahinda (Buddhist monk)|Mahendra]], and a daughter [[Sanghamitta]]. After Ashoka's accession, Mahendra headed a  Buddhist mission, sent probably under the auspices of the Emperor, to [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, &quot;A Guide to Sanchi&quot; [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.8ff] Public Domain text&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist conversion===
[[File:Diamond throne discovery.jpg|thumb|The [[Diamond throne]] built by Ashoka at the [[Mahabodhi Temple]] in [[Bodh Gaya]], at the location where the Buddha reached [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]].]]
Edict 13 on the [[Edicts of Ashoka]] Rock Inscriptions reflect the great remorse the king felt after observing the destruction of Kalinga:

His Majesty felt remorse on account of the conquest of Kalinga because, during the subjugation of a previously unconquered country, slaughter, death, and taking away captive of the people necessarily occur, whereas His Majesty feels profound sorrow and regret.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The edict goes on to address the even greater degree of sorrow and regret resulting from Ashoka's understanding that the friends and families of deceased would suffer greatly too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Smith | first=Vincent A. | authorlink=Vincent Arthur Smith | title=[[s:Rulers of India/Asoka - the Buddhist Emperor of India|Asoka - the Buddhist Emperor of India]] | series=[[Rulers of India series]] | publisher=Oxford at the Clarendon Press | year=1901 | page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legend says that one day after the war was over, Ashoka ventured out to roam the city and all he could see were burnt houses and scattered corpses. The lethal war with Kalinga transformed the vengeful Emperor Ashoka to a stable and peaceful emperor and he became a patron of Buddhism. According to the prominent [[Indology|Indologist]], [[Arthur Llewellyn Basham|A. L. Basham]], Ashoka's personal religion became Buddhism, if not before, then certainly after the Kalinga war. However, according to Basham, the Dharma officially propagated by Ashoka was not Buddhism at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Basham |first=A. L. |title=The Wonder that was India: A Survey of the History and Culture of the Indian Sub-continent Before the Coming of the Muslims |date=1954 |location=London |publisher=Sidgwick and Jackson |page=56 |oclc=181731857}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, his patronage led to the expansion of Buddhism in the Mauryan empire and other kingdoms during his rule, and worldwide from about 250 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buckley |first=Edmund |orig-year=First published 1897 |title=Universal Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Xs4Yb0FBaQC&amp;pg=PA272 |location=Chicago |publisher=The University Association |pages=272– |isbn=978-1-4400-8300-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent in this cause were his son [[Mahinda (buddhist monk)|Mahinda]] (Mahendra) and daughter [[Sanghamitra]] (whose name means &quot;friend of the Sangha&quot;), who established Buddhism in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Ashoka's son took Buddhism outside India | work=[[The Times of India]] | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Ashokas-son-took-Buddhism-outside-India/articleshow/46578312.cms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and legacy===
[[Image:Ashoka Rock Edict at Junagadh.jpg|thumb|[[Ashoka's Major Rock Edict]] at [[Junagadh]] contains inscriptions by Ashoka (fourteen of the [[Edicts of Ashoka]]), [[Rudradaman I]] and [[Skandagupta]].]]
Ashoka ruled for an estimated 36 years and died in 232 BCE.{{sfn|Kosmin|2014|p=36}} Legend states that during his cremation, his body burned for seven days and nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Strong |first=John |date=2007 |title=Relics of the Buddha |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xqAB6PKyP98C&amp;pg=PA149 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers |page=149 |isbn=978-81-208-3139-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, the Mauryan dynasty lasted just fifty more years until his empire stretched over almost all of the Indian subcontinent. Ashoka had many wives and children, but many of their names are lost to time. His chief consort (''agramahisi'') for the majority of his reign was his wife, [[Asandhimitra]], who apparently bore him no children.{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|p=82}}

In his old age, he seems to have come under the spell of his youngest wife [[Tishyaraksha]]. It is said that she had got Ashoka's son [[Kunala]], the regent in [[Taxila|Takshashila]] and the heir presumptive to the throne, blinded by a wily stratagem. The official executioners spared Kunala and he became a wandering singer accompanied by his favourite wife [[Kanchanmala]]. In [[Pataliputra]], Ashoka heard Kunala's song, and realised that Kunala's misfortune may have been a punishment for some past sin of the emperor himself. He condemned Tishyaraksha to death, restoring Kunala to the court. In the Ashokavadana, Kunala is portrayed as forgiving Tishyaraksha, having obtained enlightenment through Buddhist practice. While he urges Ashoka to forgive her as well, Ashoka does not respond with the same forgiveness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pradip2002&quot;/&gt; Kunala was succeeded by his son, [[Samprati]], who ruled for 50 years until his death.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The reign of Ashoka Maurya might have disappeared into history as the ages passed by, had he not left behind records of his reign. These records are in the form of sculpted pillars and rocks inscribed with a variety of actions and teachings he wished to be published under his name. The language used for inscription was in one of the [[Prakrit]] &quot;common&quot; languages etched in a Brahmi script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1160516/jsp/frontpage/story_85905.jsp#.VzuD6zV97IU|title=Clues to undiscovered Ashoka inscriptions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 185 BCE, about fifty years after Ashoka's death, the last Maurya ruler, [[Brihadratha Maurya|Brihadratha]], was assassinated by the commander-in-chief of the Mauryan armed forces, [[Pushyamitra Shunga]], while he was taking the Guard of Honor of his forces. Pushyamitra Shunga founded the [[Shunga dynasty]] (185-75 BCE) and ruled just a fragmented part of the Mauryan Empire. Many of the northwestern territories of the Mauryan Empire (modern-day Afghanistan and Northern Pakistan) became the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

King Ashoka, the third monarch of the Indian Mauryan dynasty, is also considered as one of the most exemplary rulers who ever lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Guiding souls: dialogues on the purpose of life|page=47|publisher=Ocean Books|author=Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, Arun Tiwari}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Buddhist kingship====
[[File:Khalsi rock edict of Ashoka.jpg|thumb|The [[Khalsi]] rock [[Edicts of Ashoka|edict of Ashoka]], which mentions the Greek kings [[Antiochus II Theos|Antiochus]], [[Ptolemy II of Egypt|Ptolemy]], [[Antigonus II Gonatas|Antigonus]], [[Magas of Cyrene|Magas]] and [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]] by name, as recipients of his teachings.]]
{{Main article|Buddhist kingship}} {{Further information|History of Buddhism|History of Buddhism in India|Buddhism in Nepal|Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Buddhism in Burma}}
One of the more enduring legacies of Ashoka was the model that he provided for the relationship between Buddhism and the state.  Emperor Ashoka was seen as a role model to leaders within the Buddhist community.  He not only provided guidance and strength, but he also created personal relationships with his supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Vesselin Popovski, Gregory M. Reichberg, and Nicholas Turner, ''World Religions and Norms of War'' (Tokyo: United Nations University Press, 2009), 66.&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout Theravada Southeastern Asia, the model of rulership embodied by Ashoka replaced the notion of divine kingship that had previously dominated (in the [[Angkor]] kingdom, for instance). Under this model of 'Buddhist kingship', the king sought to legitimise his rule not through descent from a divine source, but by supporting and earning the approval of the Buddhist ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]''. Following Ashoka's example, kings established monasteries, funded the construction of stupas, and supported the ordination of monks in their kingdom. Many rulers also took an active role in resolving disputes over the status and regulation of the sangha, as Ashoka had in calling a conclave to settle a number of contentious issues during his reign. This development ultimately led to a close association in many Southeast Asian countries between the monarchy and the religious hierarchy, an association that can still be seen today in the state-supported [[Buddhism in Thailand|Buddhism of Thailand]] and the traditional role of the Thai king as both a religious and secular leader. Ashoka also said that all his courtiers always governed the people in a moral manner.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

According to the legends mentioned in the 2nd-century CE text ''[[Ashokavadana]]'', Ashoka was not non-violent after adopting Buddhism. In one instance, a non-Buddhist in [[Pundravardhana]] drew a picture showing the Buddha bowing at the feet of [[Nirgrantha Jnatiputra]] (identified with [[Mahavira]], 24th Tirthankara of [[Jainism]]). On complaint from a Buddhist devotee, Ashoka issued an order to arrest him, and subsequently, another order to kill all the [[Ajivika]]s in Pundravardhana. Around 18,000 followers of the Ajivika sect were executed as a result of this order.&lt;ref name=&quot;John1989&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=John S. Strong | authorlink = John S.

Ashoka burnt him and his entire family alive in their house.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beni2010&quot;/&gt; He also announced an award of one [[denarius|dinara]] (silver coin) to anyone who brought him the head of a Nirgrantha heretic. According to ''Ashokavadana'', as a result of this order, his own brother was mistaken for a heretic and killed by a cowherd.&lt;ref name=&quot;John1989&quot;/&gt; However, for several reasons, scholars say, these stories of persecutions of rival sects by Ashoka appear to be clear fabrications arising out of sectarian propaganda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beni2010&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Steven2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Steven L.

==Historical sources==
{{Main article|Edicts of Ashoka|Ashokavadana|Mahavamsa|Dipavamsa}}
Ashoka was almost forgotten by the historians of the early British India, but [[James Prinsep]] contributed in the revelation of historical sources. Another important historian was British [[archaeologist]] [[John Hubert Marshall]], who was director-General of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]]. His main interests were [[Sanchi]] and [[Sarnath]], in addition to [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo-daro|Mohenjodaro]]. Sir [[Alexander Cunningham]], a British archaeologist and army engineer, and often known as the father of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]], unveiled heritage sites like the [[Bharhut]] Stupa, Sarnath, Sanchi, and the Mahabodhi Temple. [[Mortimer Wheeler]], a British archaeologist, also exposed Ashokan historical sources, especially the [[Taxila]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

[[File:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|The [[Kandahar Edict of Ashoka]], a bilingual inscription (in Greek and [[Aramaic]]) by King Ashoka, discovered at [[Kandahar]] ({{small|[[National Museum of Afghanistan]]}}).]]
Information about the life and reign of Ashoka primarily comes from a relatively small number of Buddhist sources. In particular, the [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Ashokavadana]]'' ('Story of Ashoka'), written in the 2nd century, and the two [[Pāli]] chronicles of Sri Lanka (the [[Dipavamsa]] and ''[[Mahavamsa]]'') provide most of the currently known information about Ashoka. Additional information is contributed by the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], whose authorship was finally attributed to the Ashoka of Buddhist legend after the discovery of dynastic lists that gave the name used in the edicts (''Priyadarshi''—'He who regards everyone with affection') as a title or additional name of Ashoka Maurya. Architectural remains of his period have been found at [[Kumhrar]], [[Patna]], which include an [[Kumhrar#Assembly Hall of 80-pillars|80-pillar hypostyle hall]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

[[Edicts of Ashoka]] -The Edicts of Ashoka are a collection of 33 inscriptions on the [[Pillars of Ashoka]], as well as boulders and cave walls, made by Ashoka during his reign. These inscriptions are dispersed throughout modern-day Pakistan and India, and represent the first tangible evidence of Buddhism. The edicts describe in detail the first wide expansion of Buddhism through the sponsorship of one of the most powerful kings of Indian history, offering more information about  Ashoka's proselytism, moral precepts, religious precepts, and his notions of social and animal welfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singh2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Upinder Singh |title=Governing the State and the Self: Political Philosophy and Practice in the Edicts of As´oka | journal=South Asian Studies | issue=28.2 | year=2012 | publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ashokavadana]]&amp;nbsp;– The ''Aśokāvadāna'' is a 2nd-century CE text related to the legend of Ashoka. The legend was translated into Chinese by [[Fa Hien]] in 300 CE. It is essentially a Hinayana text, and its world is that of Mathura and North-west India. The emphasis of this little known text is on exploring the relationship between the king and the community of monks (the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]) and setting up an ideal of religious life for the [[laity]] (the common man) by telling appealing stories about religious exploits. The most startling feature is that Ashoka’s conversion has nothing to do with the Kalinga war, which is not even mentioned, nor is there a word about his belonging to the Maurya dynasty. Equally surprising is the record of his use of state power to spread Buddhism in an uncompromising fashion. The legend of Veetashoka provides insights into Ashoka’s character that are not available in the widely known Pali records.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pradip2002&quot;/&gt;

''[[Mahavamsa]]'' -The ''Mahavamsa'' (&quot;Great Chronicle&quot;) is a historical poem written in the [[Pali]] language of the kings of Sri Lanka. It covers the period from the coming of King Vijaya of [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] (ancient Odisha) in 543 BCE to the reign of King Mahasena (334–361). As it often refers to the royal dynasties of India, the ''Mahavamsa'' is also valuable for historians who wish to date and relate contemporary royal dynasties in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It is very important in dating the consecration of Ashoka.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

[[Dipavamsa|Dwipavamsa]] -The Dwipavamsa, or &quot;Dweepavamsa&quot;, (i.e., Chronicle of the Island, in Pali) is the oldest historical record of Sri Lanka. The chronicle is believed to be compiled from [[Atthakatha]] and other sources around the 3rd or 4th century CE. King Dhatusena (4th century) had ordered that the Dipavamsa be recited at the [[Mahinda (buddhist monk)|Mahinda]] festival held annually in Anuradhapura.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

===Symbolism===
[[File:Caduceus on Mauryan coin.jpg|thumb|Caduceus symbol on a [[punch-marked coin]] of the [[Maurya Empire]] in [[India]], in the 3rd-2nd century BCE.]]
The [[caduceus]] appears as a symbol of the [[punch-marked coins]] of the [[Maurya Empire]] in India, in the 3rd-2nd century BCE. Numismatic research suggests that this symbol was the symbol of king Ashoka, his personal &quot;[[Mudra]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Numismatics, Damodar Dharmanand Kosambi, Orient Blackswan, 1981, p.73 [https://books.google.com/books?id=favxZII9WtwC&amp;pg=PA73]&lt;/ref&gt; This symbol was not used on the pre-Mauryan punch-marked coins, but only on coins of the Maurya period, together with the [[arched-hill symbol|three arched-hill symbol]], the &quot;peacock on the hill&quot;, the [[triskelis]] and the [[Taxila]] mark.&lt;ref&gt;Malwa Through the Ages, from the Earliest Times to 1305 A.D, Kailash Chand Jain, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1972, p.134 [https://books.google.com/books?id=_3O7q7cU7k0C&amp;pg=PA134]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perceptions and historiography==
The use of Buddhist sources in reconstructing the life of Ashoka has had a strong influence on perceptions of Ashoka, as well as the interpretations of his Edicts. Building on traditional accounts, early scholars regarded Ashoka as a primarily Buddhist monarch who underwent a conversion to Buddhism and was actively engaged in sponsoring and supporting the Buddhist monastic institution. Some scholars have tended to question this assessment. Romila Thappar writes about Ashoka that &quot;We need to see him both as a statesman in the context of inheriting and sustaining an empire in a particular historical period, and as a person with a strong commitment to changing society through what might be called the propagation of social ethics.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashoka - A Persepective&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thappar|first1=Romila|title=Ashoka - A Persepective|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=7–13 November 2009|volume=44|issue=45|pages=31–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only source of information not attributable to Buddhist sources are the Ashokan Edicts, and these do not explicitly state that Ashoka was a Buddhist. In his edicts, Ashoka expresses support for all the major religions of his time: [[Buddhism]], [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Ajivika]]ism, and his edicts addressed to the population at large (there are some addressed specifically to Buddhists; this is not the case for the other religions) generally focus on moral themes members of all the religions would accept. For example, Amartya Sen writes, &quot;The Indian Emperor Ashoka in the third century BCE presented many political inscriptions in favor of tolerance and individual freedom, both as a part of state policy and in the relation of different people to each other&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sen|first1=Amartya|title=Universal Truths and the Westernizing Illusion|journal=Harvard International Review|date=Summer 1998|volume=20|issue=3|pages=40–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the edicts alone strongly {{em|indicate}} that he was a Buddhist. In one edict he belittles rituals, and he banned Vedic animal sacrifices; these strongly suggest that he at least did not look to the Vedic tradition for guidance. Furthermore, many edicts are expressed to Buddhists alone; in one, Ashoka declares himself to be an &quot;[[upasaka]]&quot;, and in another he demonstrates a close familiarity with Buddhist texts. He erected rock pillars at Buddhist holy sites, but did not do so for the sites of other religions. He also used the word [[Dharma (Buddhism)|&quot;dhamma&quot;]] to refer to qualities of the heart that underlie moral action; this was an exclusively Buddhist use of the word. However, he used the word more in the spirit than as a strict code of conduct. Romila Thappar writes, &quot;His dhamma did not derive from divine inspiration, even if its observance promised heaven. It was more in keeping with the ethic conditioned by the logic of given situations. His logic of Dhamma was intended to influence the conduct of categories of people, in relation to each other. Especially where they involved unequal relationships.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashoka - A Persepective&quot;/&gt; Finally, he promotes ideals that correspond to the first three steps of the Buddha's graduated discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Robinson, Willard Johnson, and Thanissaro Bhikkhu, ''Buddhist Religions'', fifth ed., Wadsworth 2005, page 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interestingly, the Ashokavadana presents an alternate view of the familiar Ashoka; one in which his conversion has nothing to do with the Kalinga war or about his descent from the Maurya dynasty. Instead, Ashoka's reason for adopting non-violence appears much more personal. The Ashokavadana shows that the main source of Ashoka's conversion and the acts of welfare that followed are rooted instead in intense personal anguish at its core, from a wellspring inside himself rather than spurred by a specific event. It thereby illuminates Ashoka as more humanly ambitious and passionate, with both greatness and flaws. ''This'' Ashoka is very different from the &quot;shadowy do-gooder&quot; of later Pali chronicles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pradip2002&quot;/&gt;

Much of the knowledge about Ashoka comes from the [[Edicts of Ashoka|several inscriptions]] that he had carved on pillars and rocks throughout the empire. All his inscriptions present him as compassionate  and loving. In the Kalinga rock edits, he addresses his people as his &quot;children&quot; and mentions that as a father he desires their good.&lt;ref name=&quot;VenSDhammika_1993&quot;/&gt; These inscriptions promoted Buddhist morality and encouraged nonviolence and adherence to [[dharma]] (duty or proper behaviour), and they talk of his fame and conquered lands as well as the neighbouring kingdoms holding up his might. One also gets some primary information about the Kalinga War and Ashoka's allies plus some useful knowledge on the civil administration. The Ashoka Pillar at [[Sarnath]] is the most notable of the relics left by Ashoka. Made of sandstone, this pillar records the visit of the emperor to Sarnath, in the 3rd century BCE. It has a four-lion capital (four lions standing back to back), which was adopted as the emblem of the modern Indian republic. The lion symbolises both Ashoka's imperial rule and the kingship of the [[Buddha]]. In translating these monuments, historians learn the bulk of what is assumed to have been true fact of the Mauryan Empire. It is difficult to determine whether or not some events ever actually happened, but the stone etchings clearly depict how Ashoka wanted to be thought of and remembered.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

===Focus of debate===
[[File:Vajrasana front frieze design.jpg|thumb|300px|Front frieze of the [[Diamond throne]], built by Ashoka at [[Bodh Gaya]].]]
Recently scholarly analysis  determined that the three major foci of debate regarding Ashoka involve the nature of the Maurya empire; the extent and impact of Ashoka's pacifism; and what is referred to in the Inscriptions as ''dhamma'' or [[dharma]], which connotes goodness, virtue, and charity. Some historians{{Who|date=February 2013}} have argued that Ashoka's pacifism undermined the &quot;military backbone&quot; of the Maurya empire, while others have suggested that the extent and impact of his pacifism have been &quot;grossly exaggerated&quot;. The ''dhamma'' of the Edicts has been understood as concurrently a Buddhist lay ethic, a set of politico-moral ideas, a &quot;sort of universal religion&quot;, or as an Ashokan innovation. On the other hand, it has also been interpreted as an ''essentially political'' ideology that sought to knit together a vast and diverse empire. Scholars are still attempting to analyse both the expressed and implied political ideas of the Edicts (particularly in regard to imperial vision), and make inferences pertaining to how that vision was grappling with problems and political realities of a &quot;virtually subcontinental, and culturally and economically highly variegated, 3rd century BCE Indian empire. Nonetheless, it remains clear that Ashoka's Inscriptions represent the earliest corpus of royal inscriptions in the Indian subcontinent, and therefore prove to be a very important innovation in royal practices.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Upinder Singh |title=Governing the State and the Self: Political Philosophy and Practice in the Edicts of As´oka | journal=South Asian Studies | issue=28.2 | year=2012 | publisher=Routledge | pages=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legends of Ashoka===
[[File:Sanchi King Ashoka with his Queens, South Gate, Stupa no. 1.jpg|thumb|300px|Ashoka and his two queens, in a relief at [[Sanchi]].]]
Until the Ashokan inscriptions were discovered and deciphered, stories about Ashoka were based on the legendary accounts of his life and not strictly on historical facts. These legends were found in Buddhist textual sources such as the text of ''Ashokavadana''. The ''Ashokavadana'' is a subset of a larger set of legends in the ''Divyavadana'', though it could have existed independently as well. Following are some of the legends narrated in the ''Ashokavadana'' about Ashoka:

1) One of the stories talks about an event that occurred in a past life of Ashoka, when he was a small child named Jaya. Once when Jaya was playing on the roadside, the Buddha came by. The young child put a handful of earth in the Buddha’s begging bowl as his gift to the saint and declared his wish to one day become a great emperor and follower of the Buddha. The Buddha is said to have smiled a smile that “illuminated the universe with its rays of light”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Upinder|title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rays of light are then said to have re-entered the Buddha’s left palm, signifying that this child Jaya would, in his next life, become a great emperor. The Buddha is said to have even turned to his disciple Ananda and is said to have predicted that this child would be “a great, righteous chakravarti king, who would rule his empire from his capital at Pataliputra”.

2) Another story aims to portray Ashoka as an evil person in order to convey the importance of his transformation into a good person upon adopting Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Upinder|title=A History of Ancient and Medieval India}}&lt;/ref&gt; It begins by stating that due to Ashoka’s physical ugliness he was disliked by his father Bindusara. Ashoka wanted to become king and so he got rid of the heir by tricking him into entering a pit filled with live coals. He became famous as “Ashoka the Fierce” because of his wicked nature and bad temper. He is said to have subjected his ministers to a test of loyalty and then have 500 of them killed for failing it. He is said to have burnt his entire harem to death when certain women insulted him. He is supposed to have derived sadistic pleasure from watching other people suffer. And for this he built himself an elaborate and horrific torture chamber where he amused himself  by torturing other people. The story then goes on to narrate how it was only after an encounter with a pious Buddhist monk that Ashoka himself transformed into “Ashoka the pious”. A Chinese traveler who visited India in the 7th century CE, XuanZang recorded in his memoirs that he visited the place where the supposed torture chamber stood.

3) Another story is about events that occurred towards the end of Ashoka’s time on earth. Ashoka is said to have started gifting away the contents of his treasury to the Buddhist ''sangha''. His ministers however were scared that his eccentricity would be the downfall of the empire and so denied him access to the treasury. As a result, Ashoka started giving away his personal possessions and was eventually left with nothing and so died peacefully.

At this point it is important to note that the ''Ashokavadana'' being a Buddhist text in itself sought to gain new converts for Buddhism and so used all these legends. Devotion to the Buddha and loyalty to the ''sangha'' are stressed. Such texts added to the perception that Ashoka was essentially the ideal Buddhist monarch who deserved both admiration and emulation.&lt;ref&gt;Upinder Singh, A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India, Power and Piety: The Maurya Empire, c. 324-187 BCE&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ashoka and the relics of the Buddha===
According to Buddhist legend, particularly the [[Mahaparinirvana]], the relics of the Buddha had been shared among eight countries following his death.&lt;ref&gt;Asoka and the Buddha-Relics, T.W. Rhys Davids, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1901, pp. 397-410 [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ENG/rhy1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Ashoka endeavoured to take back the relics and share them among 84.000 stupas. This story is amply depicted in the reliefs of [[Sanchi]] and [[Bharhut]].&lt;ref&gt;Asiatic Mythology by J. Hackin [https://books.google.com/books?id=HAZrFhvqnTkC&amp;pg=PA84 p.84]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the legend, Ashoka obtain the ashes from seven of countries, but failed to take the ashes from the [[Nāga|Nagas]] at [[Ramagrama]], who were able to keep them. This scene is depicted on the tranversal portion of the southern gateway at Sanchi.

==Contributions==

===Approach towards religions===
According to Indian historian Romila Thapar, Ashoka emphasized respect for all religious teachers, and harmonious relationship between parents and children, teachers and pupils, and employers and employees.&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft Encarta Article on Ashoka&lt;/ref&gt; Ashoka's religion contained gleanings from all religions.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} He emphasized the virtues of ''Ahimsa'', respect to all religious teachers, equal respect for and study of each other's scriptures, and rational faith.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

===Global spread of Buddhism===
[[File:Sanchi2.jpg|thumb|left|Stupa of [[Sanchi]]. The central stupa was built during the Mauryas, and enlarged during the [[Sungas]], but the decorative gateway is dated to the later dynasty of the [[Satavahanas]]. ]]
As a [[Buddhist]] emperor, Ashoka believed that [[Buddhism]] is beneficial for all human beings as well as animals and plants, so he built a number of [[stupas]], [[Sangharama]], [[viharas]], [[chaitya]], and residences for Buddhist monks all over South Asia and Central Asia. According to the Ashokavadana, he ordered the construction of 84,000 stupas to house the Buddha's relics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Strong |first=John |date=2007 |title=Relics of the Buddha |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xqAB6PKyP98C&amp;pg=PA136 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers |pages=136–137 |isbn=978-81-208-3139-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Aryamanjusrimulakalpa, Ashoka takes offerings to each of these stupas traveling in a chariot adorned with precious metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Strong |first=John |date=2007 |title=Relics of the Buddha |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xqAB6PKyP98C&amp;pg=PA145 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers |page=145 |isbn=978-81-208-3139-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave donations to viharas and [[matha]]s. He sent his only daughter [[Sanghamitra]] and son [[Mahinda (buddhist monk)|Mahindra]] to spread Buddhism in Sri Lanka (then known as Tamraparni).

According to the ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', in the 17th year of Ashoka's reign, at the end of the [[Third Buddhist Council]], Ashoka sent Buddhist missionaries to nine parts of the world to propagate Buddhism.&lt;ref name=&quot;PJ&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Jermsawatdi |first=Promsak |year=1979 |title=Thai Art with Indian Influences |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0O9je9dECH8C&amp;pg=PA10 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |pages=10–11 |isbn=9788170170907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Geographical spread of known Ashoka Capitals in India.jpg|thumb|Geographical distribution of known capitals of the [[Pillars of Ashoka]]. These are all thought to have been commissioned by Ashoka.]]
Ashoka also invited Buddhists and non-Buddhists for religious conferences. He inspired the Buddhist monks to compose the  sacred religious texts, and also gave all types of help to that end. Ashoka also helped to develop viharas (intellectual hubs) such as [[Nalanda]] and [[Taxila]]. Ashoka helped to construct  [[Sanchi]] and [[Mahabodhi Temple]]. Ashoka also gave donations to non-Buddhists. As his reign continued his even-handedness was replaced with special inclination towards Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;N.V. Isaeva, ''Shankara and Indian philosophy''. SUNY Press, 1993, page 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Ashoka helped and respected both Shramanas (Buddhists monks) and Brahmins (Vedic monks). Ashoka also helped to organise the [[Third Buddhist council]] ({{circa|250 BCE}}) at Pataliputra (today's [[Patna]]). It was conducted by the monk [[Moggaliputta-Tissa]] who was the spiritual teacher of Ashoka.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Emperor Ashoka's son, Mahinda, also helped with the spread of Buddhism by translating the Buddhist Canon into a language that could be understood by the people of Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Crosby, ''Wiley-Blackwell Guides to Buddhism: Theravada Buddhism: Continuity, Diversity, and Identity'' (Somerset: Wiley-Blackwell, 2013), 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is well known that Ashoka sent ''dütas'' or emissaries to convey messages or letters, written or oral (rather both), to various people. The VIth Rock Edict about &quot;oral orders&quot; reveals this. It was later confirmed that it was not unusual to add oral messages to written ones, and the content of Ashoka's messages can be inferred likewise from the XIIIth Rock Edict: They were meant to spread his ''dhammavijaya,'' which he considered the highest victory and which he wished to propagate everywhere (including far beyond India). There is obvious and undeniable trace of cultural contact through the adoption of the [[Kharosthi]] script, and the idea of installing inscriptions might have travelled with this script, as [[Achaemenid]] influence is seen in some of the formulations used by Ashoka in his inscriptions. This indicates to us that Ashoka was indeed in contact with other cultures, and was an active part in mingling and spreading new cultural ideas beyond his own immediate walls.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinuber2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Oskar von Hinüber |title=Did Hellenistic Kings Send Letters to Aśoka? | journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society | issue=130.2 | year=2010 | publisher=Freiburg | pages=262–265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Asoka Kaart.gif|thumb|Buddhist [[proselytism]] at the time of king Ashoka (260–218&amp;nbsp;BCE).]]
In his edicts, Ashoka mentions some of the people living in [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenic countries]] as converts to Buddhism and recipients of his envoys, although no Hellenic historical record of this event remains:

{{quote|Now it is conquest by Dhamma that Beloved-of-the-Gods considers to be the best conquest.

Even where Beloved-of-the-Gods' envoys have not been, these people too, having heard of the practice of Dhamma and the ordinances and instructions in Dhamma given by Beloved-of-the-Gods, are following it and will continue to do so. | [[Edicts of Ashoka]], [[Ashoka's Major Rock Edict|Rock Edict]] (S. Dhammika)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/dhammika/wheel386.html#rock14 The Edicts of King Ashoka: an English rendering by Ven. S. Dhammika].

It is not too far-fetched to imagine, however, that Ashoka received letters from Greek rulers and was acquainted with the Hellenistic royal orders in the same way as he perhaps knew of the inscriptions of the Achaemenid kings, given the presence of ambassadors of Hellenistic kings in India (as well as the ''dütas'' sent by Ashoka himself).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinuber2012&quot;/&gt; [[Dionysius (ambassador)|Dionysius]] is reported to have been such a Greek ambassador at the court of Ashoka, sent by [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130728023626/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+6.21 Pliny the Elder, &quot;The Natural History&quot;, 6, 21]&lt;/ref&gt; who himself is mentioned in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]] as a recipient of the Buddhist proselytism of Ashoka. Some Hellenistic philosophers, such as [[Hegesias of Cyrene]], who probably lived under the rule of King  [[Magas of Cyrene|Magas]], one of the supposed recipients of Buddhist emissaries from Asoka, are sometimes thought to have been influenced by Buddhist teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wjW_BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA184 Historical Dictionary of Ancient Greek Philosophy, Anthony Preus, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2015, p.184]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks in India even seem to have played an active role in the propagation of Buddhism, as some of the emissaries of Ashoka, such as [[Dharmaraksita]], are described in [[Pāli|Pali]] sources as leading Greek ([[Yona]]) Buddhist monks, active in spreading Buddhism (the ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', XII&lt;ref name = &quot;plgotw&quot;&gt;Full text of the ''Mahavamsa'' [http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa/chapters.html Click chapter XII]&lt;/ref&gt;).

Some Greeks (Yavana) may have played an administrative role in the territories ruled by Ashoka. The Girnar inscription of [[Rudradaman]] records that during the rule of Ashoka, a [[Yavana]] Governor was in charge in the area of [[Girnar]], [[Gujarat]], mentioning his role in the construction of a water reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Influence on Ancient India

===As administrator===
[[File:MauryanRingstone.JPG|thumb|left|Mauryan ringstone, with standing goddess. Northwest Pakistan. 3rd century BCE. [[British Museum]].]]
Ashoka's military power was strong, but after his conversion to Buddhism, he maintained friendly relations with three major [[Tamil people|Tamil]] kingdoms in the South—namely, [[Chera dynasty|Cheras]], [[Cholas]] and [[Pandyas]]—the post-Alexandrian empire, [[Tamraparni]], and [[Suvarnabhumi]]. His [[Ashoka's Major Rock Edict|edicts]] state that he made provisions for medical treatment of humans and animals in his own kingdom as well as in these neighbouring states. He also had wells dug and trees planted along the roads for the benefit of the common people.&lt;ref name=&quot;VenSDhammika_1993&quot;&gt;[http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/ashoka.html The Edicts of King Ashoka] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328144411/http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/ashoka.html |date=28 March 2014 }}, English translation (1993) by  Ven. S. Dhammika. {{ISBN|955-24-0104-6}}. Retrieved on: 21 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal welfare===

Ashoka's rock edicts declare that injuring living things is not good, and no animal should be sacrificed for slaughter.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2004|p=120}} However, he did not prohibit common cattle slaughter or beef eating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Simoons |first=Frederick J. |date=1994 |title=Eat Not This Flesh: Food Avoidances from Prehistory to the Present |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JwGZTQunH00C&amp;pg=PA108 |edition=2nd |location=Madison |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |page=108 |isbn=978-0-299-14254-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He imposed a ban on killing of &quot;all four-footed creatures that are neither useful nor edible&quot;, and of specific animal species including several birds, certain types of fish and bulls among others. He also banned killing of female goats, sheep and pigs that were nursing their young; as well as their young up to the age of six months. He also banned killing of all fish and [[neutering|castration]] of animals during certain periods such as [[Chaturmasa]] and [[Uposatha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/dhammika/wheel386.html |title= The Edicts of King Asoka |translator=Ven.

Ashoka also abolished the royal hunting of animals and restricted the slaying of animals for food in the royal residence.&lt;ref name=&quot;GeraldMichael1998&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author1=Gerald Irving A.

===Ashoka Chakra===
{{main article|Ashoka Chakra}}
[[File:Ashoka Chakra.svg|thumb|The [[Ashoka Chakra]], ''&quot;the wheel of Righteousness&quot; (Dharma in [[Sanskrit]] or Dhamma in [[Pali]])&quot;'']]
The [[Ashoka Chakra]] (the wheel of Ashoka) is a depiction of the [[Dharmachakra]] (the Wheel of Dharma). The wheel has 24 spokes which represent the 12 Laws of Dependent Origination and the 12 Laws of Dependent Termination. The Ashoka Chakra has been widely inscribed on many relics of the [[Mauryan]] Emperor, most prominent among which is the Lion Capital of [[Sarnath]] and The [[Ashoka Pillar]]. The most visible use of the Ashoka Chakra today is at the centre of the National flag of the Republic of India (adopted on 22 July 1947), where it is rendered in a Navy-blue color on a White background, by replacing the symbol of Charkha ([[Spinning wheel]]) of the pre-independence versions of the flag. The Ashoka Chakra can also been seen on the base of the Lion Capital of Ashoka which has been adopted as the National Emblem of India.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The Ashoka Chakra was created by Ashoka during his reign. [[Chakra]] is a [[Sanskrit]] word which also means &quot;cycle&quot; or &quot;self-repeating process&quot;. The process it signifies is the cycle of time—as in how the world changes with time.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

A few days before India became independent in August 1947, the specially-formed [[Constituent Assembly]] decided that the [[flag of India]] must be acceptable to all parties and communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOTW&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/in.html|title=India|accessdate= 11 October 2006|last=Heimer|first=Željko|date=2 July 2006|work=Flags of the World| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061018060420/http://crwflags.com/fotw/flags/in.html| archivedate= 18 October 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A flag with three colours, Saffron, White and Green with the Ashoka Chakra was selected.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

===Stone architecture===

[[File:Rampurva bull capital detail.jpg|thumb|[[Rampurva|Rampurva bull capital]], detail of the [[abacus (architecture)|abacus]], with two [[palmette|&quot;flame palmettes&quot;]] framing a lotus surrounded by small rosette flowers.]]
Ashoka is often credited with the beginning of stone architecture in India, possibly following the introduction of stone-building techniques by the [[Greco-Bactrian|Greeks after Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fpfTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT21 Introduction to Indian Architecture Bindia Thapar, Tuttle Publishing, 2012, p.21] &quot;Ashoka used the knowledge of stone craft to begin the tradition of stone architecture in India, dedicated to Buddhism.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Before Ashoka's time, buildings were probably built in non-permanent material, such as wood, [[bamboo]] or [[thatch]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TlVeuxIgjwQC&amp;pg=PA14 Gardner's Art through the Ages: Non-Western Perspectives, Fred S. Kleiner, Cengage Learning, 2009, p14]&lt;/ref&gt; Ashoka may have rebuilt his palace in [[Pataliputra]] by replacing wooden material by stone,{{sfn|Mookerji|1995|p=96}} and may also have used the help of foreign craftmen.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto3&quot;&gt;&quot;Ashoka was known to be a great builder who may have even imported craftsmen from abroad to build royal monuments.&quot; Monuments, Power and Poverty in India: From Ashoka to the Raj, A. S. Bhalla, I.B.Tauris, 2015 p.18 [https://books.google.com/books?id=emATBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18]&lt;/ref&gt; Ashoka also innovated by using the permament qualities of stone for his written [[Edicts of Ashoka|edicts]], as well as his pillars with Buddhist symbolism.

====Pillars of Ashoka (Ashokstambha)====
{{Main article|Pillars of Ashoka}}
[[File:Ashok Sthamba.jpg|thumb|left|The Ashokan pillar at [[Lumbini]], [[Nepal]], Buddha's birthplace]]
The pillars of Ashoka are a series of columns dispersed throughout the northern Indian subcontinent, and erected by Ashoka during his reign in the 3rd century BCE. Originally, there must have been many pillars of Ashoka although only ten with inscriptions still survive. Averaging between forty and fifty feet in height, and weighing up to fifty tons each, all the pillars were quarried at Chunar, just south of Varanasi and dragged, sometimes hundreds of miles, to where they were erected. The first Pillar of Ashoka was found in the 16th century by Thomas Coryat in the ruins of ancient Delhi. The wheel represents the sun time and Buddhist law, while the [[swastika]] stands for the cosmic dance around a fixed center and guards against evil.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

====Lion Capital of Ashoka (Ashokmudra)====
{{Main article|Lion Capital of Ashoka}}
[[File:Sarnath capital.jpg|thumb|Ashoka's pillar capital of [[Sarnath]]. Ashokan capitals were highly realistic and used a characteristic polished finish, giving a shiny appearance to the stone surface. This sculpture has been adopted as the [[National Emblem of India]]. 3rd century BCE.]]

The Lion capital of Ashoka is a sculpture of four lions standing back to back. It was originally placed atop the Ashoka pillar at [[Sarnath]], now in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], India. The pillar, sometimes called the Ashoka Column, is still in its original location, but the Lion Capital is now in the [[Sarnath Museum]]. This Lion Capital of Ashoka from Sarnath has been adopted as the [[State Emblem of India|National Emblem of India]] and the wheel (&quot;[[Ashoka Chakra]]&quot;) from its base was placed onto the center of the [[National Flag of India]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The capital contains four lions (Indian / Asiatic Lions), standing back to back, mounted on a short cylindrical abacus, with a frieze carrying sculptures in high relief of an elephant, a galloping horse, a bull, and a lion, separated by intervening spoked chariot-wheels over a bell-shaped lotus. Carved out of a single block of polished sandstone, the capital was believed to be crowned by a 'Wheel of Dharma' (Dharmachakra popularly known in India as the &quot;Ashoka Chakra&quot;).  The Sarnath pillar bears one of the Edicts of Ashoka, an inscription against division within the Buddhist community, which reads, &quot;No one shall cause division in the order of monks.&quot;{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The four animals in the Sarnath capital are believed to symbolise different steps of Lord [[Buddha]]'s life.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
* The Elephant represents the Buddha's idea in reference to the dream of Queen Maya of a white elephant entering her womb.
* The Bull represents desire during the life of the Buddha as a prince.
* The Horse represents Buddha's departure from palatial life.
* The Lion represents the accomplishment of Buddha.

Besides the religious interpretations, there are some non-religious interpretations also about the symbolism of the Ashoka capital pillar at Sarnath. According to them, the four lions symbolise Ashoka's rule over the four directions, the wheels as symbols of his enlightened rule (Chakravartin) and the four animals as symbols of four adjoining territories of India.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
