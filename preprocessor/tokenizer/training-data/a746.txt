'''Alexander Jannaeus''' (also known as '''Alexander Jannai/Yannai'''; [[Hebrew]]: אלכסנדר ינאי) was the second [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean]] king of Judaea from 103 to 76&amp;nbsp;BC. A son of [[John Hyrcanus]], he inherited the throne from his brother [[Aristobulus I]], and married his brother's widow, Queen [[Salome Alexandra]]. From his conquests to expand the kingdom to a bloody civil war, Alexander's reign has been generalized as cruel and oppressive with never ending conflict.{{sfn|Saldarini|2001|p=89}} Although Josephus and other historians refer to him by the name of &quot;Alexander Yannai&quot;, his full name was &quot;Alexander Jonathan&quot; as attested to by his coins wherein he calls himself &quot;Yehonathan the king&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Virtual Library, Yannai Alexander&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Alexander Jannaeus was the third son of John Hyrcanus, by his second wife. When Aristobulus I, Hyrcanus' son by his first wife, became king, he deemed it necessary for his own security to imprison his half-brother. Aristobulus died after a reign of one year. Upon his death, his widow, [[Salome Alexandra]] had Alexander and his brothers released from prison.

Alexander, as the oldest living brother, had the right not only to the throne but also to Salome, the widow of his deceased brother, who had died childless; and, although she was thirteen years older than him, he married her in accordance with Jewish law. By her, he had two sons, the eldest, [[Hyrcanus II]] became high-priest in 62&amp;nbsp;BC and [[Aristobulus II]] who was high-priest from 66 - 62&amp;nbsp;BC and started a bloody civil war with his brother, ending in his capture by [[Pompey|Pompey the Great]]. Like his brother he was an avid supporter of the aristocratic priestly faction known as the [[Sadducees]], his wife Salome on the other hand came from a [[pharisaic]] family (her brother was [[Simeon ben Shetach]] a famous pharisee leader), and was more sympathetic to their cause and protected them throughout his turbulent reign.&lt;ref&gt;New World Encyclopedia, Alexander Jannaeus&lt;/ref&gt; Like his father Alexander also served as the high priest. This raised the ire of the Rabbis who insisted that these two offices should not be combined.&lt;ref&gt;ibid&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Talmud&lt;ref&gt;kiddushin 66a&lt;/ref&gt; Yannai was a questionable desecrated priest (rumor had it that his mother was captured in Modiin and violated) and was not allowed to serve in the temple according to the rabbis, this infuriated the king and sided with the Sadducees who defended him. This incident led the king to turn against the pharisees and persecute them until his death.

==Conquests==
[[Image:Judea Alexander Janneüs.PNG|right|thumb|Hasmonean Kingdom under Alexander Jannaeus&lt;br&gt;{{legend|lime|situation in 103 BC}}{{legend|fuchsia|area conquered}}]]
===War with Ptolemy Lathyrus===
Alexander's first expedition was against the city of Ptolemais ([[Akko|Acre]]). While Alexander went forward to siege the city, Zoilus, ruler of the coastal city [[Dor, Israel|Dora]] and [[Caesarea Maritima|Straton's Tower]] took the opportunity to see if he could perhaps save Ptolemais in hopes of gaining territory. Alexander's Hasmonean army quickly defeated Zoilus's forces with little trouble. Ptolemais and Zoilus then requested aid from [[Ptolemy IX Lathyros]], who had been cast out by his mother [[Cleopatra III of Egypt|Cleopatra III]]. Ptolemy founded a kingdom in [[History of Cyprus|Cyprus]] after being cast out by his mother. The situation at Ptolemais was seized as an opportunity by Ptolemy to possibly gain a stronghold and control the Judean coast in order to invade Egypt.{{sfn|Atkinson|2012|p=131}}

Ptolemy landed a large army for the relief of the town; but Alexander met him with treachery, arranging an alliance with him openly while secretly he sought to obtain the help of his mother against him. When Alexander formed an alliance with Ptolemy, Ptolemy in good gesture, handed over Ptolemais, Zoilus, Dora, and Straton's Tower to Alexander.{{sfn|Schürer|Vermes|Millar|2014|p=116}} As soon as Ptolemy learned of Alexander's scheme, he invaded the [[Galilee|Galilee region]] capturing [[Shikhin|Asochis]].{{sfn|Davies|Finkelstein|1984|p=600}}{{sfn|Kasher|1998|p=80}} Ptolemy also initiated an attack upon [[Sepphoris]] but failed.{{sfn|Finegan|2015|p=223}}

Alexander might easily have lost his crown and Judea its independence as the result of this battle, had it not been for the assistance extended by Egypt. Cleopatra's two Jewish generals, Helkias and Ananias, persuaded the queen of the dangers of allowing her banished son Ptolemy to remain victorious and she entrusted them with an army against him. As a result, Ptolemy was forced to withdraw to Cyprus, and Alexander was saved. The Egyptians, as compensation for their aid, desired to annex Judea to their country, but considerations touching the resident Egyptian Jews, who were the main support of her throne, induced Cleopatra to modify her longings for conquest. The Egyptian army withdrawn, Alexander found his hands free; and forthwith he planned new campaigns.{{sfn|Borgen|1998|p=84}}{{sfn|Bar-Kochva|2010|p=93}}

===Transjordan and coastal conquest===
Alexander captured [[Gadara]] and the strong fortress [[Amathus (Transjordan)|Amathus]] in the [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]] region; but, in an ambush set for him by Theodorus, ruler of Amathus, he lost the battle. Alexander was more successful in his expedition against the Hellenized coastal cities (what had once been [[Philistia]]), capturing [[Rafah|Raphia]] and [[Anthedon (Palestine)|Anthedon]]. Finally, in 96 BC{{sfn|Negev|Gibson|2005}} Jannaeus outlasted the inhabitants of [[Gaza City|Gaza]] in a year-long siege, which he occupied through treachery, and gave up to be pillaged and burned by his soldiery. This victory gained Judean control over the Mediterranean outlet for the [[Nabataean kingdom|Nabatean]] trade routes.{{sfn|Schäfer|2003|pp=74 &amp; 75}}

==Judean Civil War==
[[File:WillemSwiddeAlexanderJannaeus.png|thumb|Alexander Jannaeus feasting during the crucifixion of the Pharisees, engraving by [[Willem Swidde]], seventeenth century]]
The Judean Civil War initially began after the conquest of Gaza by Jannaeus around 99 BC. Due to Jannaeus's victory at Gaza, the Nabatean kingdom no longer controlled their main trade route to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] at Gaza and to the road leading to Damascus. Therefore, the Nabatean king [[Obodas I]] launched an ambush on Alexander in a steep valley in [[Gadara]] where Jannaeus &quot;was lucky to escape alive&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;lost kingdom&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FcAoBq4_EnEC|title=Petra and the Lost Kingdom of the Nabataeans |first= Taylor|last=Jane|pages=14, 17, 30, 31|year=2001|publisher=[[I.B.Tauris]]|location=London, United Kingdom|accessdate=8 July 2016|isbn=9781860645082 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Jannaeus was defeated in the [[Battle of Gadara]] against the Nabataeans, he returned to fierce Jewish opposition in Jerusalem.{{sfn|Eshel|2008|pp=117 - 123}} Alexander had to cede the acquired territories to the Nabataeans so that he could dissuade Obodas from supporting his opponents in Judea.&lt;ref name=&quot;lost kingdom&quot;/&gt;

During the Jewish holiday of [[Sukkot|Feast of Tabernacles]], Alexander Jannaeus, while officiating as the [[High Priest of Israel|High Priest]] at the Temple in Jerusalem, demonstrated his support of the [[Sadducees]] by refusing to perform the water [[libation]] ceremony properly: instead of pouring it on the altar, he poured it on his feet. The crowd responded with shock at his mockery and showed their displeasure by pelting Alexander with the [[etrog]]im ([[citron]]s) that they were holding in their hands. Outraged, he ordered soldiers to kill those who insulted him, more than 6,000 people in the Temple courtyard were massacred. With further frustration, Alexander had wooden barriers build around the altars preventing people from sacrificing and deny daily offerings except for the priests. He also allied himself with foreign troops such as the [[Pisidia]]ns and the [[Cilicia]]ns who would later help his regime during the civil war.{{sfn|Eshel|2008|pp=117 - 123}} This incident during the Feast of Tabernacles was a major factor leading up to the Judean Civil War by igniting popular opponents of Jannaeus.{{sfn|Kaiser|1998|p=482}}{{sfn|Rasmussen|2014}}

Overall, the war lasted six years and left 50,000 Judeans dead. After Jannaeus succeeded early in the war, the rebels asked for Seleucid assistance. Judean insurgents joined forces with [[Demetrius III Eucaerus]] to fight against Jannaeus. The Seleucid forces defeated Jannaeus at [[Shechem]] and forced him to take refuge in the mountains. However, these Judean rebels ultimately decided that it was better to live under a terrible Jewish king than backtrack to a Seleucid ruler. After 6,000 Jews returned to Jannaeus, Demetrius was defeated. The end of the Civil War brought a sense of national solidarity against Seleucid influence. Nevertheless, Jannaeus was uninterested in reconciliation within the Judean State.{{sfn|Eshel|2008|pp=117 - 123}}{{sfn|Rasmussen|2014}}

The aftermath of the Judean Civil War consisted of popular unrest, poverty and grief over the fallen soldiers on both sides. The greatest impact of the war was the victor's revenge. Josephus reports that Jannaeus brought 800 Pharisee rebels to Jerusalem and had them crucified, and had the throats of the rebel's wives and children cut before their eyes as Jannaeus ate with his concubines.{{sfn|Stegemann|1998|p=130}}{{sfn|Crossan|1999|p=462}}{{sfn|Hengel|1977|p=84}}

==Coinage==
The coinage of Alexander Jannaeus is characteristic of the early Jewish coinage in that it avoided human or animal representations, in opposition to the surrounding Greek, and later Roman types of the period. Jewish coinage instead focused on symbols, either natural, such as the [[palm tree]], the [[pomegranate]] or the star, or man-made, such as the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]], the [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]], trumpets or [[cornucopia]].

[[Image:JanaeusCoinPhoto.jpg|thumb|300px|Coin of Alexander Jannaeus (103 BC to 76 BC).&lt;br/&gt;
'''Obv:''' [[Seleucid]] anchor and Greek Legend: BASILEOS ALEXANDROU &quot;King Alexander&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;
'''Rev:''' Eight-spoke wheel or star within diadem. Hebrew legend inside the spokes: &quot;Yehonatan the King&quot;.]]
Alexander Jannaeus was the first of the Jewish kings to introduce the &quot;eight-ray star&quot; or &quot;eight-spoked wheel&quot; symbol, in his [[bronze]] &quot;Widow's mite&quot; coins, in combination with the widespread [[Seleucid]] numismatic symbol of the anchor. Depending on the make, the star symbol can be shown with straight spokes connected to the outside circle, in a style rather indicative of a wheel. On others, the spokes can have a more &quot;flame-like&quot; shape, more indicative of the representation of a star within a diadem.

It is not clear what the wheel or star may exactly symbolize, and interpretations vary, from the morning star, to the sun or the heavens. The influence of some [[Persia]]n symbols of a star within a diadem, or the eight-spoked [[Buddhist]] wheel (see the coins of the [[Indo-Greek]] king [[Menander I]] with this symbol) have also been suggested. The eight-spoked Macedonian star (a variation of which is the [[Vergina Sun]]), emblem of the royal [[Argead dynasty]] and the ancient kingdom of [[Macedon]]ia, within a Hellenistic [[Diadem (personal wear)|diadem]] symbolizing royalty (many of the coins depict a small knot with two ends on top of the diadem), seem to be the most probable source for this symbol.

The most likely explanation is that the symbol is a star encased in a diadem and it is a religious explanation. Biblical law forbids the making of graven images (especially see {{Bibleverse|Deuteronomy|4:16,23|KJV}}), yet the image of a monarch is a staple of Hellenistic coins. In place of an image of himself, therefore, it is likely that Alexander Jannaeus chose a star, in keeping with {{Bibleverse|Numbers|24:17|KJV}}, &quot;A star rises from Jacob, a scepter comes forth from Israel&quot;. This verse generally was seen as a biblical support for monarchy (and specifically as support for a Davidic monarchy). Jannaeus, however, could have seen it as an image of his achievements, if not his own rule. This is how the rest of Numbers 24:17 and verses 18 and 19 continue: The star, it says, &quot;smashes the brow of Moab, the foundation of all children of Seth. Edom becomes a possession, yea, Seir a possession of its enemies; but Israel is triumphant. A victor issues from Jacob to wipe out what is left of Ir&quot;. Considering Jannaeus' conquests—creating a kingdom that rivalled those of David and Solomon and may have even exceeded those—the &quot;star&quot; envisioned in the prophecy of Balaam in Numbers was a perfect match for him.
