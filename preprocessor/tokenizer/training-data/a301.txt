{{Emotion}}
'''Anxiety''' is an [[emotion]] characterized by an unpleasant state of inner turmoil, often accompanied by nervous behavior, such as pacing back and forth, [[Somatic anxiety|somatic complaints]], and [[Rumination (psychology)|rumination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Seligman&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1-link=Martin Seligman |last1=Seligman |first1=M.E.P. |last2=Walker |first2=E.F. |author3-link=David Rosenhan |last3=Rosenhan |first3=D.L. |title=Abnormal psychology |edition=4th |location=New York |publisher=W.W.

People facing anxiety may withdraw from situations which have provoked anxiety in the past.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker, P. 2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barker |first1=P. |year=2003 |title=Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing: The Craft of Caring |publisher=Edward Arnold |location=London |isbn=978-0-340-81026-2}}{{Page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various types of anxiety. [[Existential]] anxiety can occur when a person faces [[angst]], an [[existential crisis]], or [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] feelings. People can also face [[mathematical anxiety]], [[somatic anxiety]], [[stage fright]], or [[test anxiety]]. [[Social anxiety]] and [[stranger anxiety]] are caused when people are apprehensive around strangers or other people in general. Furthermore, anxiety has been linked with physical symptoms such as [[Irritable bowel syndrome|IBS]] and can heighten other mental health illnesses such as OCD and panic disorder. The first step in the management of a person with anxiety symptoms is to evaluate the possible presence of an underlying medical cause, whose recognition is essential in order to decide its correct treatment.&lt;ref name=WHO2009&gt;{{cite book |author= World Health Organization|date= 2009|title= Pharmacological Treatment of Mental Disorders in Primary Health Care|url= http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44095/1/9789241547697_eng.pdf|location= Geneva|isbn=978-92-4-154769-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TestaGiannuzzi2013partIII&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Testa A, Giannuzzi R, Daini S, Bernardini L, Petrongolo L, Gentiloni Silveri N| title=Psychiatric emergencies (part III): psychiatric symptoms resulting from organic diseases | journal=Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci | year= 2013 | volume= 17 Suppl 1 | pages= 86–99 | pmid=23436670 | url=http://www.europeanreview.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/86-99.pdf | type= Review }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anxiety symptoms may be masking an organic disease, or appear associated or as a result of a medical disorder.&lt;ref name=WHO2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=TestaGiannuzzi2013partIII /&gt;&lt;ref name=TestaGiannuzzi2013partII&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Testa A, Giannuzzi R, Sollazzo F, Petrongolo L, Bernardini L, Daini S | title=Psychiatric emergencies (part II): psychiatric disorders coexisting with organic diseases. | journal=Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci | year= 2013 | volume= 17  | issue=  Suppl 1 | pages= 65–85 | pmid=23436668 | url=http://www.europeanreview.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/55-64.pdf }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TestaGiannuzzi2013partI&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Testa A, Giannuzzi R, Sollazzo F, Petrongolo L, Bernardini L, Daini S | title=Psychiatric emergencies (part I): psychiatric disorders causing organic symptoms. | journal=Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci | year= 2013 | volume= 17  | issue=  Suppl 1 | pages= 55–64 | pmid=23436668 | url=http://www.europeanreview.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/55-64.pdf  }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anxiety can be either a short term &quot;state&quot; or a long term &quot;[[Trait theory|trait]]&quot;. Whereas trait anxiety represents worrying about future events, anxiety disorders are a group of [[mental disorder]]s characterized by feelings of anxiety and fear.&lt;ref name= DSM5&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental DisordersAmerican Psychiatric Associati.|year=2013|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|location=Arlington|isbn=978-0890425558|pages=189–195|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anxiety disorders are partly genetic but may also be due to drug use, including [[alcohol]], [[caffeine]], and [[Mood disorder#Substance-induced|benzodiazepines]] (which are often prescribed to treat anxiety), as well as withdrawal from [[Substance abuse|drugs of abuse]]. They often occur with other mental disorders, particularly [[bipolar disorder]], [[eating disorder]]s, [[major depressive disorder]], or certain [[personality disorder]]s. Common treatment options include lifestyle changes, medication, and [[psychotherapy|therapy]].

Anxiety is distinguished from [[fear]], which is an appropriate cognitive and emotional response to a perceived threat. Anxiety is related to the specific behaviors of [[fight-or-flight response]]s, defensive behavior or escape. It occurs in situations only perceived as uncontrollable or unavoidable, but not realistically so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Öhman |first=Arne |year=2000 |chapter=Fear and anxiety: Evolutionary, cognitive, and clinical perspectives |editor1-first=Michael |editor1-last=Lewis |editor2-first=Jeannette M. |editor2-last=Haviland-Jones |title=Handbook of emotions |pages=573–93 |location=New York |publisher=The Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-57230-529-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Barlow defines anxiety as &quot;a future-oriented mood state in which one is not ready or prepared to attempt to cope with upcoming negative events,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.55.11.1247 |title=Unraveling the mysteries of anxiety and its disorders from the perspective of emotion theory |year=2000 |last1=Barlow |first1=David H. |journal=American Psychologist |volume=55 |issue=11 |pages=1247–63 |pmid=11280938}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is a distinction between future and present dangers which divides anxiety and fear.

Fear and anxiety can be differentiated in four domains: (1) duration of emotional experience, (2) temporal focus, (3) specificity of the threat, and (4) motivated direction. Fear is defined as short lived, present focused, geared towards a specific threat, and facilitating escape from threat; anxiety, on the other hand, is defined as long-acting, future focused, broadly focused towards a diffuse threat, and promoting excessive caution while approaching a potential threat and interferes with constructive coping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2010.08.004 |title=Differences between trait fear and trait anxiety: Implications for psychopathology |year=2011 |last1=Sylvers |first1=Patrick |last2=Lilienfeld |first2=Scott O. |last3=Laprairie |first3=Jamie L. |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=31 |pages=122–37 |pmid=20817337 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anxiety can be experienced with long, drawn out daily symptoms that reduce quality of life, known as chronic (or generalized) anxiety, or it can be experienced in short spurts with sporadic, stressful [[panic attack]]s, known as acute anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rynn MA, Brawman-Mintzer O |title=Generalized anxiety disorder: acute and chronic treatment |journal=CNS Spectr |volume=9 |issue=10 |pages=716–23 |year=2004 |pmid=15448583}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Symptoms of anxiety can range in number, intensity, and frequency, depending on the person. While almost everyone has experienced anxiety at some point in their lives, most do not develop long-term problems with anxiety.

===Existential===
{{Further information|Angst|Existential crisis|Nihilism}}

The philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], in ''[[The Concept of Anxiety]]'' (1844), described anxiety or dread associated with the &quot;dizziness of freedom&quot; and suggested the possibility for positive resolution of anxiety through the self-conscious exercise of responsibility and choosing. In ''Art and Artist'' (1932), the psychologist [[Otto Rank]] wrote that the [[psychological trauma]] of birth was the pre-eminent human symbol of existential anxiety and encompasses the creative person's simultaneous fear of – and desire for – separation, individuation, and differentiation.

The [[theology|theologian]] [[Paul Tillich]] characterized existential anxiety&lt;ref name=&quot;Tillich&quot;&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Paul Tillich |last=Tillich |first=Paul |year=1952 |title=The Courage To Be |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-08471-4|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; as &quot;the state in which a [[being]] is aware of its possible nonbeing&quot; and he listed three categories for the nonbeing and resulting anxiety: ontic (fate and death), [[Morality|moral]] ([[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and condemnation), and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] (emptiness and [[Meaning (existential)|meaninglessness]]). According to Tillich, the last of these three types of existential anxiety, i.e. spiritual anxiety, is predominant in modern times while the others were predominant in earlier periods. Tillich argues that this anxiety can be [[Acceptance#Self acceptance|accepted]] as part of the [[human condition]] or it can be resisted but with negative consequences. In its pathological form, spiritual anxiety may tend to &quot;drive the person toward the creation of certitude in systems of meaning which are supported by [[tradition]] and [[authority]]&quot; even though such &quot;undoubted certitude is not built on the rock of [[reality]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Tillich /&gt;

According to [[Viktor Frankl]], the author of ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'', when a person is faced with extreme mortal dangers, the most basic of all human wishes is to find a [[meaning of life]] to combat the &quot;trauma of nonbeing&quot; as death is near.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abulof|first1=Uriel|title=The Mortality and Morality of Nations|date=2015|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107097070|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Test and performance===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Educational psychology]] --&gt;
{{Main article|Test anxiety|Mathematical anxiety|Stage fright|Somatic anxiety}}
According to [[Yerkes-Dodson law]], an optimal level of arousal is necessary to best complete a task such as an exam, performance, or competitive event. However, when the anxiety or level of arousal exceeds that optimum, the result is a decline in performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Teigen&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Yerkes-Dodson: A Law for all Seasons |last=Teigen |first=Karl Halvor |journal=Theory Psychology |date=November 1994 |volume=4 |pages=525–47 |doi=10.1177/0959354394044004 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Test anxiety is the uneasiness, apprehension, or nervousness felt by students who have a fear of failing an [[Test (student assessment)|exam]]. Students who have test anxiety may experience any of the following: the association of [[Grade (education)|grades]] with [[Self-esteem|personal worth]]; fear of embarrassment by a teacher; fear of [[Social alienation|alienation]] from parents or friends; time pressures; or feeling a loss of control. Sweating, dizziness, headaches, racing heartbeats, nausea, fidgeting, uncontrollable crying or laughing and drumming on a desk are all common. Because test anxiety hinges on [[fear of negative evaluation]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Liebert&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Cognitive and emotional components of test anxiety: A distinction and some initial data |last1=Liebert |first1=Robert M. |last2=Morris |first2=Larry W. |journal=Psychological Reports |year=1967 |volume=20 |pages=975–978 |doi=10.2466/pr0.1967.20.3.975 |issue=3 |pmid=6042522|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; debate exists as to whether test anxiety is itself a unique anxiety disorder or whether it is a specific type of social [[phobia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Beidel&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Comorbidity of test anxiety and other anxiety disorders in children |last1=Beidel |first1=D.C. |last2=Turner |first2=S.M. |journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology |year=1988 |volume=16 |pages=275–287 |issue=3 |doi=10.1007/BF00913800 |pmid=3403811}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DSM-IV classifies test anxiety as a type of social phobia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rapee&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=A cognitive-behavioral model of anxiety in social phobia |last1=Rapee |first1=Ronald M. |last2=Heimberg |first2=Richard G.|journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |volume=35 |issue=8 |date=August 1997 |pages=741–56 |doi=10.1016/S0005-7967(97)00022-3 |pmid=9256517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term &quot;test anxiety&quot; refers specifically to students,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mathur&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://medind.nic.in/daa/t11/i2/daat11i2p337.pdf |title=Impact of Hypnotherapy on examination anxiety and scholastic performance among school children |last1=Mathur |first1=S. |last2=Khan |first2=W. |date=October 2011 |journal=Delhi Psychiatry Journal |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=337–342 }}&lt;/ref&gt; many workers share the same experience with regard to their career or profession.

===Stranger, social, and intergroup===
{{Main article|Stranger anxiety|Social anxiety}}

Humans generally require social acceptance and thus sometimes dread the disapproval of others. Apprehension of being judged by others may cause anxiety in social environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-375096-9.00028-6 |chapter=Introduction: Toward an Understanding of Social Anxiety Disorder |title=Social Anxiety |year=2010 |last=Hofmann |first=Stefan G. |last2=Dibartolo |first2=Patricia M. |isbn=978-0-12-375096-9 |pages=xix–xxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anxiety during social interactions, particularly between strangers, is common among young people. It may persist into adulthood and become social anxiety or social phobia. &quot;[[Stranger anxiety]]&quot; in small children is not considered a phobia. In adults, an excessive fear of other people is not a developmentally common stage; it is called [[social anxiety]]. According to Cutting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Ben |editor1-last=Thomas |editor2-first=Sally |editor2-last=Hardy |editor3-first=Penny |editor3-last=Cutting |year=1997 |title=Mental Health Nursing: Principles and Practice |publisher=Mosby |location=London |isbn=978-0-7234-2590-8}}{{Page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; social phobics do not fear the crowd but the fact that they may be judged negatively.

[[Social anxiety]] varies in degree and severity. For some people, it is characterized by experiencing discomfort or awkwardness during physical social contact (e.g. embracing, shaking hands, etc.), while in other cases it can lead to a fear of interacting with unfamiliar people altogether. Those suffering from this condition may restrict their lifestyles to accommodate the anxiety, minimizing social interaction whenever possible. Social anxiety also forms a core aspect of certain personality disorders, including [[Avoidant Personality Disorder|avoidant personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10578-012-0307-0 |title=Social Functioning in Youth with Anxiety Disorders: Association with Anxiety Severity and Outcomes from Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy |year=2012 |last1=Settipani |first1=Cara A. |last2=Kendall |first2=Philip C. |journal=Child Psychiatry &amp; Human Development |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=1–18 |pmid=22581270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the extent that a person is fearful of social encounters with unfamiliar others, some people may experience anxiety particularly during interactions with outgroup members, or people who share different group memberships (i.e., by race, ethnicity, class, gender, etc.). Depending on the nature of the antecedent relations, cognitions, and situational factors, intergroup contact may be stressful and lead to feelings of anxiety. This apprehension or fear of contact with outgroup members is often called interracial or intergroup anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stephan|first=Walter G.|last2=Stephan| first2=Cookie W.|title=Intergroup anxiety|journal=Journal of Social Issues|date=1985|volume=41|issue=3|pages=157–175|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1985.tb01134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As is the case the more generalized forms of [[social anxiety]], intergroup anxiety has behavioral, cognitive, and affective effects. For instance, increases in schematic processing and simplified information processing can occur when anxiety is high. Indeed, such is consistent with related work on attentional bias in implicit memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richeson|first=Jennifer A.| last2=Trawalter| first2=Sophie|title=The threat of appearing prejudiced and race-based attentional biases|journal=Psychological Science|date=2008|volume=19|issue=2|pages=98–102|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02052.x|pmid=18271854}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mathews|first=Andrew|last2=Mogg|first2=Karin|last3=May|first3=Jon|last4=Eysenck|first4=Michael|title=Implicit and explicit memory bias in anxiety|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|date=1989|volume=98|issue=3|pages=236–240|doi=10.1037/0021-843x.98.3.236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Anne|last2=French|first2= Christopher C.|title=Effects of encoding and anxiety on implicit and explicit memory performance|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=1991|volume=12|issue=2|pages=131–139|doi=10.1016/0191-8869(91)90096-t}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally recent research has found that implicit racial evaluations (i.e. automatic prejudiced attitudes) can be amplified during intergroup interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amodio|first=David M.|last2=Hamilton |first2= Holly K.|title=Intergroup anxiety effects on implicit racial evaluation and stereotyping|journal=Emotion|date=2012|volume=12|issue=6|pages=1273–1280|doi=10.1037/a0029016|citeseerx=10.1.1.659.5717}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative experiences have been illustrated in producing not only negative expectations, but also avoidant, or  antagonistic, behavior such as hostility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plant|first=Ashby  E.|last2= Devine| first2=Patricia G.|title=The antecedents and Implications of Interracial Anxiety|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=2003|volume=29|pages=790–801|doi=10.1177/0146167203029006011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, when compared to anxiety levels and cognitive effort (e.g., impression management and self-presentation) in intragroup contexts, levels and depletion of resources may be exacerbated in the intergroup situation.

===Trait===
Anxiety can be either a short term 'state' or a long term &quot;trait&quot;. Trait anxiety reflects a stable tendency to respond with state anxiety in the anticipation of threatening situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macses.ucsf.edu/Research/Psychosocial/notebook/anxiety.html |title=Anxiety |last=Schwarzer |first=R. |date=December 1997 |accessdate=2008-01-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070920115547/http://www.macses.ucsf.edu/Research/Psychosocial/notebook/anxiety.html |archivedate=September 20, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis showed that a high level of [[neuroticism]] is a risk factor for development of anxiety symptoms and disorders.&lt;ref name=&quot;NeuroticismMA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jeronimus B.F.|author2=Kotov, R.|author3=Riese, H.|author4=Ormel, J.| year = 2016 | title = Neuroticism's prospective association with mental disorders halves after adjustment for baseline symptoms and psychiatric history, but the adjusted association hardly decays with time: a meta-analysis on 59 longitudinal/prospective studies with 443 313 participants | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume =  46| issue =  | pages = 2883–2906| doi=10.1017/S0033291716001653 | pmid=27523506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such anxiety may be conscious or unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Giddey |first1=M. |last2=Wright |first2=H. |title=Mental Health Nursing: From first principles to professional practice |publisher=Stanley Thornes}}{{Page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anxiety induced by the need to choose between similar options is increasingly being recognized as a problem for individuals and for organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/style/fashion/trends/article85734.ece |work=The Times |location=London |title=Premium choice anxiety |date=April 27, 2008 |accessdate=2010-04-25 |first1=Jonathan |last1=Downey}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[Capgemini]] wrote: &quot;Today we're all faced with greater choice, more competition and less time to consider our options or seek out the right advice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uk.capgemini.com/news/pr1487 Is choice anxiety costing british 'blue chip' business?], [[Capgemini]], Aug 16, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The first form refers to a choice in which there are multiple potential outcomes with known or calculable probabilities. The second form refers to the uncertainty and ambiguity related to a decision context in which there are multiple possible outcomes with unknown probabilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hartley&quot;/&gt;

===Anxiety disorders===
{{main|Anxiety disorder}}
&lt;!-- Do not add new content here.  Add to body of Anxiety disorder article, and only if it rises to the importance of the lead there, update the lead there, then update this. Per [[WP:SYNC]] --&gt;
Anxiety disorders are a group of [[mental disorder]]s characterized by feelings of [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] and [[fear]].&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; Anxiety is a worry about future events and fear is a reaction to current events.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name= DSM5/&gt; --&gt; These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as a [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]] and shakiness.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name= DSM5/&gt; --&gt; There are a number of anxiety disorders: including [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[phobia|specific phobia]], [[social anxiety disorder]], [[separation anxiety disorder]], [[agoraphobia]], [[panic disorder]], and [[selective mutism]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name= DSM5/&gt; --&gt; The disorder differs by what results in the symptoms.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name= DSM5/&gt; --&gt; People often have more than one anxiety disorder.&lt;ref name= DSM5/&gt;

&lt;!-- Causes and diagnosis --&gt;
The cause of anxiety disorders is a combination of [[heredity|genetic]] and environmental factors.&lt;ref name=NIH2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Anxiety Disorders|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders/index.shtml#pub2|website=NIMH|accessdate=14 August 2016|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk factors include a history of [[child abuse]], family history of mental disorders, and [[poverty]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt; --&gt; Anxiety disorders often occur with other mental disorders, particularly [[major depressive disorder]], [[personality disorder]], and [[substance use disorder]].&lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt; To be diagnosed symptoms typically need to be present at least six months, be more than would be expected for the situation, and decrease functioning.&lt;ref name= DSM5/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt; Other problems that may result in similar symptoms including [[hyperthyroidism]], [[heart disease]], [[caffeine]], [[alcohol]], or [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] use, and withdrawal from certain drugs, among others.&lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=TestaGiannuzzi2013partIII/&gt;

&lt;!-- Management  --&gt;
Without treatment, anxiety disorders tend to remain.&lt;ref name= DSM5/&gt;&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; Treatment may include lifestyle changes, [[psychotherapy|counselling]], and medications.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt; --&gt; Counselling is typically with a type of [[cognitive behavioural therapy]].&lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt; Medications, such as [[antidepressants]] or [[beta blockers]], may improve symptoms.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology --&gt;
About 12% of people are affected by an anxiety disorder in a given year and between 5-30% are affected at some point in their life.&lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kess2007&gt;{{cite journal|last= Kessler | displayauthors=etal|date=2007 |title= Lifetime prevalence and age-of-onset distributions of mental disorders in the World Health Organization’s World Mental Health Survey Initiative |journal= World Psychiatry |volume=6 |issue= 3|pages=168–76|pmid=18188442 |pmc=2174588}}&lt;/ref&gt; They occur about twice as often in females as males, and generally begin before the age of 25.&lt;ref name= DSM5/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lancet2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Craske|first1=MG|last2=Stein|first2=MB|title=Anxiety.|journal=Lancet|date=24 June 2016|pmid=27349358|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30381-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common are specific phobia which affects nearly 12% and social anxiety disorder which affects 10% at some point in their life.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt; --&gt; They affect those between the ages of 15 and 35 the most and become less common after the age of 55.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt; --&gt; Rates appear to be higher in the United States and Europe.&lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt;

==Risk factors==

=== Neuroanatomy ===
Neural circuitry involving the [[amygdala]] (which regulates emotions like anxiety and fear, stimulating the [[Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis|HPA Axis]] and [[sympathetic nervous system]]) and [[hippocampus]] (which is implicated in emotional memory along with the amygdala) is thought to underlie anxiety.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.105.2.325 |title=From normal fear to pathological anxiety |year=1998 |last1=Rosen |first1=Jeffrey B. |last2=Schulkin |first2=Jay |journal=Psychological Review |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=325–50 |pmid=9577241}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who have anxiety tend to show high activity in response to emotional stimuli in the amygdala.&lt;ref&gt;Nolen-Hoeksema, S. (2013). (Ab)normal Psychology (6th edition). McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers believe that excessive anxiety can lead to an overpotentiation of the limbic system (which includes the amygdala and nucleus accumbens), giving increased future anxiety, but this does not appear to have been proven.&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Compassion and Healing in Medicine and Society: On the Nature and Use of Attachment Solutions to Separation Challenges|author=Fricchione, G.|date=2011|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=9781421402208|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iz_kWnfcExoC|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=How the Brain Talks to Itself: A Clinical Primer of Psychotherapeutic Neuroscience|author=Harris, J.|date=1998|publisher=Haworth|isbn=9780789004086|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ErU92jetUTMC|page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research upon adolescents who as infants had been highly apprehensive, vigilant, and fearful finds that their [[nucleus accumbens]] is more sensitive than that in other people when deciding to make an action that determined whether they received a reward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bar-Haim&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02401.x |title=Neural Correlates of Reward Processing in Adolescents with a History of Inhibited Temperament |year=2009 |last1=Bar-Haim |first1=Yair |last2=Fox |first2=Nathan A. |last3=Benson |first3=Brenda |last4=Guyer |first4=Amanda E. |last5=Williams |first5=Amber |last6=Nelson |first6=Eric E. |last7=Perez-Edgar |first7=Koraly |last8=Pine |first8=Daniel S. |last9=Ernst |first9=Monique |journal=Psychological Science |volume=20 |issue=8 |pages=1009–18 |pmid=19594857 |pmc=2785902}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests a link between circuits responsible for fear and also reward in anxious people. As researchers note, &quot;a sense of 'responsibility', or self-agency, in a context of uncertainty (probabilistic outcomes) drives the neural system underlying appetitive motivation (i.e., nucleus accumbens) more strongly in temperamentally inhibited than noninhibited adolescents&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bar-Haim&quot; /&gt;

=== Genetics ===
Genetics and family history (e.g., parental anxiety) may predispose an individual for an increased risk of an anxiety disorder, but generally external stimuli will trigger its onset or exacerbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition.|last = American Psychiatric Association|firstjjhjj = |publisher = American Psychiatric Association|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Arlington, VA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic differences account for about 43% of variance in panic disorder and 28% in generalized anxiety disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Psychiatric 'diseases' versus behavioral disorders and degree of genetic influence|journal = Psychological Medicine|date = 2011-01-01|issn = 1469-8978|pmid = 20459884|pages = 33–40|volume = 41|issue = 1|doi = 10.1017/S003329171000084X|first = O.

=== Substance-induced ===
Several drugs can cause or worsen anxiety, whether in intoxication, withdrawal or from chronic use. These include [[alcohol]], [[tobacco]], [[cannabis]], [[sedative]]s (including prescription [[benzodiazepine]]s), [[opioid]]s (including prescription pain killers and illicit drugs like heroin), [[stimulant]]s (such as caffeine, cocaine and amphetamines), [[hallucinogen]]s, and [[inhalants]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; While many often report self-medicating anxiety with these substances, improvements in anxiety from drugs are usually short-lived (with worsening of anxiety in the long-term, sometimes with acute anxiety as soon as the drug effects wear off) and tend to be exaggerated. Acute exposure to toxic levels of [[benzene]] may cause euphoria, anxiety, and irritability lasting up to 2 weeks after the exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - The Emergency Response Safety and Health Database: Systemic Agent: BENZENE - NIOSH|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ershdb/emergencyresponsecard_29750032.html|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = 2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poor [[Coping (psychology)|coping skills]] (e.g., rigidity/inflexible problem solving, denial, avoidance, impulsivity, extreme self-expectation, affective instability, and inability to focus on problems) are associated with anxiety. Anxiety is also linked and perpetuated by the person's own pessimistic outcome expectancy and how they cope with feedback negativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.2010.00997.x |title=Anxiety and feedback negativity |year=2010 |last1=Gu |first1=Ruolei |last2=Huang |first2=Yu-Xia |last3=Luo |first3=Yue-Jia |journal=Psychophysiology}}{{primary source inline|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temperament (e.g., [[neuroticism]])&lt;ref name=&quot;NeuroticismMA&quot;/&gt; and attitudes (e.g. pessimism) have been found to be risk factors for anxiety.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bienvenu Ginsburg 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1080/09540260701797837|title = Prevention of anxiety disorders|year = 2007|last1 = Bienvenu|first1 = O. Joseph|last2 = Ginsburg|first2 = Golda S.|journal = [[International Review of Psychiatry]] |volume = 19|issue = 6|pages = 647–54|pmid = 18092242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cognitive distortion]]s such as overgeneralizing, catastrophizing, mind reading, emotional reasoning, binocular trick, and mental filter can result in anxiety. For example, an overgeneralized belief that something bad &quot;always&quot; happens may lead someone to have excessive fears of even minimally risky situations and to avoid benign social situations due to anticipatory anxiety of embarrassment. Such unhealthy thoughts can be targets for successful treatment with [[cognitive therapy]].

[[Psychodynamics|Psychodynamic]] theory posits that anxiety is often the result of opposing [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] wishes or fears that manifest via maladaptive [[Defence mechanisms|defense mechanisms]] (such as suppression, repression, anticipation, regression, somatization, passive aggression, dissociation) that develop to [[Ego psychology|adapt]] to problems with early [[Object relations theory|objects]] (e.g., caregivers) and [[Self psychology|empathic failures]] in childhood. For example, persistent parental discouragement of anger may result in repression/suppression of angry feelings which manifests as gastrointestinal distress (somatization) when provoked by another while the anger remains unconscious and outside the individual's awareness. Such conflicts can be targets for successful treatment with [[Psychodynamic psychotherapy|psychodynamic therapy]].

==== Evolutionary psychology ====
An [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation is that increased anxiety serves the purpose of increased [[vigilance (psychology)|vigilance]] regarding potential  threats in the environment as well as increased tendency to take proactive actions regarding such possible threats. This may cause [[false positive]] reactions but an individual suffering from anxiety may also avoid real threats. This may explain why anxious people are less likely to die due to accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0016242 |title=The bright side of being blue: Depression as an adaptation for analyzing complex problems |year=2009 |last1=Andrews |first1=Paul W. |last2=Thomson Jr |first2=J. Anderson |journal=Psychological Review |volume=116 |issue=3 |pages=620–54 |pmid=19618990 |pmc=2734449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When people are confronted with unpleasant and potentially harmful stimuli such as foul odors or tastes, [[Positron emission tomography|PET-scans]] show increased bloodflow in the [[amygdala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.94.8.4119 |title=Emotion, olfaction, and the human amygdala: Amygdala activation during aversive olfactory stimulation |year=1997 |last1=Zald |first1=David H. |first2=Jose V. |last2=Pardo |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=94 |issue=8 |pages=4119–24 |jstor=41966 |bibcode=1997PNAS...94.4119Z |pmid=9108115 |pmc=20578}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=David H. |last1=Zald |first2=Mathew C. |last2=Hagen |first3=José V. |last3=Pardo |title=Neural Correlates of Tasting Concentrated Quinine and Sugar Solutions |journal=Journal of Neurophysiology |pmid=11826070 |url=http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11826070 |year=2002 |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=1068–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these studies, the participants also reported moderate anxiety. This might indicate that anxiety is a protective mechanism designed to prevent the organism from engaging in potentially harmful behaviors.

=== Social ===
Social risk factors for anxiety include a history of trauma (e.g., physical, sexual or emotional abuse or assault), early life experiences and parenting factors (e.g., rejection, lack of warmth, high hostility, harsh discipline, high parental [[Negative affectivity|negative affect]], anxious childrearing, modelling of dysfunctional and drug-abusing behaviour, discouragement of emotions, poor socialization, poor attachment, and child abuse and neglect), cultural factors (e.g., stoic families/cultures, persecuted minorities including the disabled), and socioeconomics (e.g., uneducated, unemployed, impoverished (although developed countries have higher rates of anxiety disorders than developing countries)).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12480&amp;page=530 |chapter=Table E-4 Risk Factors for Anxiety |page=530 |editor1-first=Mary Ellen |editor1-last=O'Connell |editor2-first=Thomas |editor2-last=Boat |editor3-first=Kenneth E. |editor3-last=Warner |publisher=National Academies Press |title=Prevention of Mental Disorders, Substance Abuse, and Problem Behaviors: A Developmental Perspective |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-309-12674-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender socialization====
Contextual factors that are thought to contribute to anxiety include gender socialization and learning experiences. In particular, learning mastery (the degree to which people perceive their lives to be under their own control) and instrumentality, which includes such traits as self-confidence, independence, and competitiveness fully mediate the relation between gender and anxiety. That is, though gender differences in anxiety exist, with higher levels of anxiety in women compared to men, gender socialization and learning mastery explain these gender differences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communicationcache.com/uploads/1/0/8/8/10887248/anticipatory_anxiety_patterns_for_male_and_female_public_speakers.pdf Anticipatory Anxiety Patterns for Male and Female Public Speakers], Ralph Behnke and Chris Sawyer, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=June 2015}} Research has demonstrated the ways in which facial prominence in photographic images differs between men and women. More specifically, in official online photographs of politicians around the world, women's faces are less prominent than men's. Interestingly enough, the difference in these images actually tended to be greater in cultures with greater institutional gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0361684312450004 |title=Understanding Gender Differences in Anxiety: The Mediating Effects of Instrumentality and Mastery |year=2012 |last1=Zalta |first1=Alyson K. |last2=Chambless |first2=Dianne L. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=488–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
