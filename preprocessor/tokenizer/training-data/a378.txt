'''Aarhus''' ({{IPA-da|ˈɒːhuːˀs|lang|Århus.ogg}}; officially spelled '''Århus''' from 1948 until 31 December 2010) is the second-largest city in [[Denmark]] and the seat of [[Aarhus municipality]]. It is located on the east coast of the [[Jutland]] peninsula, in the geographical centre of Denmark, {{convert|187|km}} northwest of [[Copenhagen]] and {{convert|289|km}} north of [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]]. The inner [[urban area]] contains 269,022 inhabitants ({{as of|2017|01|01|lc=on}}) and the municipal population is 335,684 ({{as of|2017|lc=on}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;DSPopulation&quot;/&gt; Aarhus is the central city in the [[East Jutland metropolitan area]], which had a total population of 1.378 million in 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;East Jutland&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Tal og statistik|trans-title=Figures and Statistics|url=http://www.byregionoestjylland.dk/Statistik.html|publisher=Byregion Østjylland|accessdate=25 April 2016|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of Aarhus began as a fortified [[Viking]] settlement founded in the 8th century and with the first written records stemming from the [[bishopric]] seated here from at least 948. The city was founded on the northern shores of [[Förden and East Jutland Fjorde|a fjord]] at a [[natural harbour]] and the primary driver of growth was for centuries seaborne trade in agricultural products. [[Market town]] privileges were granted in 1441, but growth stagnated in the 17th&amp;nbsp;century as the city suffered blockades and bombardments during the [[Dano-Swedish War (1658–60)|Swedish Wars]]. In the 19th century it was occupied twice by German troops during the [[First Schleswig War|Schleswig Wars]] but avoided destruction. As the [[industrial revolution]] took hold, the city grew to become the second-largest in the country by the 20th century.

Today Aarhus is at the cultural and economic core of the region and the largest centre for trade, services and industry in Jutland. The city ranks as the 92nd largest city in the [[European Union]], and as [[List of largest cities of the European Union by population within city limits|number 234]] among [[world cities]]. It is also a top 100 [[Meeting|conference]] city in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iccaworld.com/dcps/doc.cfm?docid=1696.&lt;/ref&gt; Aarhus is the principal industrial [[port]] of the country in terms of container handling and an important trade hub in [[Kattegat]]. Major Danish companies have based their headquarters here and people commute for work and leisure from a wide area in [[Region Midtjylland]]. It is a centre for research and education in the [[Nordic countries]] and home to [[Aarhus University]], [[Scandinavia]]'s largest university, including [[Aarhus University Hospital]] and [[INCUBA Science Park]]. Being the Danish city with the youngest demographics, with 48,482 inhabitants aged under 18,&lt;ref name=&quot;DSPopulation&quot;/&gt; Aarhus is also the second fastest growing Danish city, with an average growth of 4,500 people per annum since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.statistikbanken.dk/02&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarhus is known for its musical history. In the 1950s many [[jazz]] clubs sprang up around the city, fuelled by the young population. By the 1960s, the music scene diversified into [[rock music|rock]] and other genres. In the 1970s and 1980s, Aarhus became the centre for Denmark's rock music fostering many iconic bands such as [[TV-2 (band)|TV-2]] and [[Gnags]]. Aarhus is home to the annual eight-day [[Aarhus International Jazz Festival]], the [[Spot (music festival)|SPoT Festival]] and the [[NorthSide Festival (Denmark)|NorthSide Festival]].

In 2017, Aarhus has been selected as [[European Capital of Culture]] along with [[Paphos]] in Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aarhus2017.dk/en/&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, Aarhus will host the [[Sailing World Championships|Hempel Sailing World Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarhus2018.com/ Hempel Sailing World Championships]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In [[Valdemar's Census Book]] (1231) the city was called ''Arus'', and in Icelandic it was known as ''Aros'', later written as Aars.&lt;ref name=Salmonsen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/salmonsen/2/1/0067.html|title=Salmonsens konversationsleksikon / Anden Udgave|page=53|publisher=[[Salmonsens Konversationsleksikon|Salmonsen]]|accessdate=16 July 2014|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a compound of the two words ''ār'', genitive of ''ā'' (&quot;river&quot;, Modern Danish ''å''), and ''ōss'' (&quot;mouth&quot;, in Modern Icelandic this word is still used for &quot;river delta&quot;).&lt;ref name=dsd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Jylland/Jylland_-_byer/%C3%85rhus|title=Aarhus|publisher=[[Gyldendal]]|accessdate=16 July 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name originates from the city's location around the mouth of Aarhus Å ([[Aarhus River]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;The Aarhus River&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitaarhus.dk/east-jutland/history/aarhus-aa|author=Visit Aarhus|title=The Aarhus River|accessdate=26 June 2016|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitaarhus.com/ln-int/denmark/vikings/history-of-aarhus|author=Visit Aarhus|title= History of Aarhus|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spelling &quot;Aarhus&quot; is first found in 1406 and gradually became the norm in the 17th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name=Salmonsen/&gt;

===Aarhus/Århus spelling===
With the [[Å#Origin|Danish spelling reform of 1948]], &quot;Aa&quot; was changed to &quot;Å&quot;. Some Danish cities resisted the new spelling of their names, notably [[Aalborg]] and [[Aabenraa]]. Århus city council explicitly embraced the new spelling, as it was thought to enhance an image of progressiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhusportalen.dk/default.asp?Id=1881&amp;AjrDcmntId=30979|title=Det omstridte bolle-å|publisher=Aarhus portalen|accessdate=16 July 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the city council voted to change the name from &quot;Århus&quot; to &quot;Aarhus&quot; in order to strengthen the international profile of the city. The renaming came into effect on 1 January 2011.

Certain geographically affiliated names have been updated to reflect the name of the city, such as the Aarhus River, changed from &quot;Århus Å&quot; to &quot;Aarhus Å&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Aarhus River&quot;/&gt; It is still grammatically correct to write geographical names with the letter Å and local councils are allowed to use the Aa spelling as an alternative. Whichever spelling local authorities choose, most newspapers and public institutions will accept it. Some official authorities such as the [[Dansk Sprognævn|Danish Language Committee]], publisher of the [[Retskrivningsordbogen|Danish Orthographic Dictionary]], still retain &quot;Århus&quot; as the main name, providing &quot;Aarhus&quot; as a new, second option, in brackets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsn.dk/nyt/nyheder/2011/aarhus-eller-aarhus|title=Århus eller Aarhus?|year=2011|publisher=Danish Language Committee|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Aarhus}}

===Early history===
[[File:Scale model of Aarhus.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|Model of the early fortified Viking town Aros. North is up.]]
Founded in the early [[Viking Age]], Aarhus is one of the oldest cities in Denmark, along with [[Ribe]] and [[Hedeby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/|title=Byhistoriske hovedtræk - Byens grundlæggelse|language=Danish|publisher=[[Aarhus Municipality]]|accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological evidence under the Aros settlement's defences indicate the site was a town as early as the last quarter of the 8th&amp;nbsp;century, considerably earlier than had been generally supposed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristeligt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/historie/vikingernes-aros-mellem-land-og-hav|title=Vikingernes Aros mellem land og hav|publisher=''Kristeligt Dagblad''|first=Claus |last=Grymer|date=1 June 2005|accessdate=16 July 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hum.au.dk/moesgaard/vikingemuseet/tidligaros.htm The earliest Århus] [http://www.moesgaardmuseum.dk/vikingemuseet/ The Viking Museum] {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discoveries after a 2003 archaeological dig unearthed half-buried [[longhouse]]s, firepits, glass pearls and a road dated to the late 700s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hum.au.dk/moesgaard/vikingemuseet/norrevold.htm|title=Excavations - Nørrevold|language=Danish|publisher=The Viking Museum (Moesgård Museum)|accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists have conducted several excavations in the inner city since the 1960s revealing wells, streets, homes and workshops. In the buildings and adjoining archaeological layers, everyday utensils like combs, jewellery and basic multi-purpose tools from approximately the year 900 have been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hum.au.dk/moesgaard/vikingemuseet/udgravninger.htm|title=Excavations|language=Danish|publisher=The Viking Museum (Moesgård Museum)|accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The centre of Aarhus was once a [[Germanic paganism|pagan burial site]] until Aarhus' first church, Holy Trinity Church, a timber structure, was built upon it during the reign of [[Frode]], King of Jutland, around 900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danmarkskirker.natmus.dk/uploads/tx_tcchurchsearch/Aarhus_0045-0059.pdf|title=Kirkerne i Århus|publisher=Danmarks Kirker: Nationalmuseet|page=52|accessdate=16 July 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 900s an earth rampart for the defence of the early city was constructed, encircling the settlement, much like the defence structures found at [[Viking ring fortress]]es elsewhere. The rampart was later reinforced by [[Harald Bluetooth]], and together with the town's geographical placement, this suggests that Aros was an important trade and military centre. There are strong indications of a former royal residence from the Viking Age in [[Viby J|Viby]], a few kilometres south of the Aarhus city centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hum.au.dk/moesgaard/vikingemuseet/viby.htm Vikingernes Aros] Vikingemuseet {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bishopric of Aarhus dates back to at least 948 when [[Adam of Bremen]] reported the bishop [[Reginbrand]] attended the [[synod of Ingelheim]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/aarhus-domkirke/?tx_historyview_pi1%5Blang%5D=1&amp;cHash=a83dfe233ede9644167a9b5ea9aa35a4|author=Aarhus University|title=Aarhus Cathedral|date=2 July 2012|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_Oldtid/Yngre_Jernalder/Et_samfund_vendt_imod_havet_800-1050_e.Kr/By_efter_by|title=By efter by|publisher=[[Gyldendal]]|accessdate=16 July 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bishopric and the town's geographical location propelled prosperous growth and development of the early medieval town.&lt;ref name=&quot;Danmarkshistorien&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/aarhus-1/?tx_historyview_pi1%5Blang%5D=1&amp;cHash=42dfd94aaa459af3505372f8b2af029a|author=Aarhus University|title=Aarhus|accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finding of six [[runestone]]s in and around Aarhus indicates the city had some significance around the year 1000, as only wealthy nobles traditionally used them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hum.au.dk/moesgaard/vikingemuseet/runesten.htm|title=Vikingernes Aros|publisher=Aarhus Universitet|accessdate=16 July 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The era was turbulent and violent with several naval attacks on the city, such as [[Harald Hardrada]]'s assault around 1050, when the Holy Trinity Church was burned to the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristeligt&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;year&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/svend-estridsen-ca-1019-107476/|author=Aarhus University|title=Svend Estridsen, ca. 1019–1074/76|accessdate=27 June 2016|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Århus Katedral2.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Aarhus Cathedral (1300).]]
The growing influence of the Church during the [[Middle Ages]] gradually turned Aarhus, with its bishopric, into a prosperous religious centre. Many public and religious buildings were built in and around the city; notably [[Aarhus Cathedral]] was initiated in the late 12th&amp;nbsp;century by the influential bishop [[Peder Vognsen]]. In 1441, [[Christopher III]] issued the oldest known charter granting market town status although similar privileges may have existed as far back as the 12th&amp;nbsp;century. The charter is the first official recognition of the town as a regional power and is by some considered Aarhus' birth certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/%C3%85rhus_k%C3%B8bstads_privilegium|title=Stenbroen|publisher=Aarhus Stadsarkiv|website=AarhusWiki|language=Danish|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official and religious status spurred growth so in 1477 the defensive earthen ramparts, ringing the town since the Viking age, were abandoned to accommodate expansion. Parts of the ramparts are still in existence today and can be experienced as steep slopes at the riverside and they have also survived in some place names of the inner city, including the streets of [[Volden, Aarhus|Volden]] (The Rampart) and [[Graven, Aarhus|Graven]] (The Moat).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hum.au.dk/moesgaard/vikingemuseet/voldgraven.htm|title=The Moat|language=Danish|publisher=The Viking Museum|accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/Historien_om_Aarhus|title=Historien om Aarhus|language=Danish|publisher=Aarhus Stadsarkiv|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aarhus grew to become one of the largest cities in the country by the early 16th&amp;nbsp;century. In 1657, [[octroi]] was imposed in larger Danish cities which changed the layout and face of Aarhus over the following decades. Wooden city walls were erected to prevent smuggling, with gates and toll booths on the major thoroughfares, [[Mejlgade]] and [[Studsgade]]. The city gates funnelled most traffic through a few streets where [[merchant]] quarters were built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/registranter/stenbro/side6.htm |title=Stenbroen |publisher=Aarhus Kommune |website=Aarhus Kommunes digitale korttjenester |language=Danish |accessdate=22 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072940/http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/registranter/stenbro/side6.htm |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th&amp;nbsp;century, Aarhus entered a period of recession as it suffered blockades and bombardments during the [[Dano-Swedish War (1658–60)|Swedish wars]] and trade was dampened by the preferential treatment of the capital by the state.{{sfn|Olsen|2000|p=124}} It was not until the middle of the 18th&amp;nbsp;century growth returned in large part due to trade with the large agricultural [[catchment area]]s around the city; particularly [[grain]] proved to be a remunerative export.&lt;ref name=&quot;Danmarkshistorien&quot;/&gt; The first factories were established at this time as the [[industrial revolution]] reached the country and in 1810 the harbour was expanded to accommodate growing trade.&lt;ref name=dcfb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dendigitalebyport.byhistorie.dk/koebstaeder/by.aspx?koebstadID=74|title=Århus: Byhistorie|publisher=Dansk Center for Byhistorie|accessdate=16 July 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrialisation===
[[File:Aarhus set fra bakkerne i Riis Skov.jpg|right|thumb|View of Aarhus, 1850.]]
Following the [[Napoleonic wars]], Denmark lost Norway and was excluded from international trade for some years which caused a recession for Aarhus' trade-based economy that lasted until the 1830s. The economy turned around as the [[History of Denmark#Industrialisation|industrial revolution]] reached the city and factories with steam-driven machinery became more productive.

In 1838, the electoral laws were reformed leading to elections for the 15 seats on the city council. The rules were initially very strict allowing only the wealthiest citizens to run. In the 1844 elections only 174 citizens qualified out of a total population of more than 7,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aarhus.dk/da/politik/Byraadet/Byens-raad-dengang/Byens-raad-1838-1868.aspx|title=Byens raad 1838–1868|language=Danish|first=Aarhus |last=Kommune|website=Aarhus Kommune|publisher=Aarhus Municipality|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first city council, mainly composed of wealthy merchants and industrialists, quickly looked to improve the harbour, situated along the [[Aarhus River]]. Larger ships and growing freight volumes made a river harbour increasingly impractical. In 1840, the harbour was moved to the coast, north of the river where it became the largest industrial harbour outside Copenhagen over the following 15 years. From the outset, the new harbour was controlled by the city council, as it is to this day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Byhistorie.dk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.byhistorie.dk/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/I-medgang-og-modgang-rapport-over-udviklingen-af-den-moderne-havn-i-Aarhus-fra-o.-1840-2006.pdf|last=Andersen|first=Lasse|title=Rapport over udviklingen af den moderne havn i Aarhus fra o. 1840–2006|website=Dansk Center for Byhistorie|accessdate=27 June 2016|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Preussiske soldater inddriver kvæg ved Domkirken. Set fra Mejlgade (Kunstner Hans Frederik Meyer Visby) 1864.jpg|left|thumb|Prussian soldiers herding cattle by Aarhus cathedral, 1864.]]
During the [[First Schleswig War]] Aarhus was occupied by German troops from 21 June to 24 July 1849. The city was spared any fighting, but in [[Vejlby]] north of the city a cavalry skirmish known as [[Skirmish of Århus|Rytterfægtningen]] took place which stopped the German advance through Jutland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/sitecore/content/Subsites/AarhusStadsarkiv/Home/Servicesider/Nyheder/2014/3-kvartal/Ugens-Aarhushistorie-Rytterfaegtningen.aspx?sc_lang=da|title=Ugens Aarhushistorie - Rytterfægtningen|publisher=Aarhus Kommune|website=Aarhus Stadsarkiv|language=Danish|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war and occupation left a notable impact on the city as many streets, particularly in [[Frederiksbjerg]], are named after Danish officers of the time. Fifteen years later, in 1864, the city was occupied again, this time for seven months, during the [[Second Schleswig War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stiften.dk/nyheder/1864-jylland-besat-af-tyske-tropper|title=1864 Jylland besat af tyske tropper|first=Ivan Freund |last=Nielsen|publisher=Aarhus Stiftstidende|language=Danish|date=10 October 2014|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/perioder/det-unge-demokrati-1848-1901/treaarskrigen-1848-50-1-slesvigske-krig/|title=Det unge demokrati 1848–1901|website=Aarhus University|first=Erik Strange |last=Petersen|language=Danish|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of wars and occupation the city continued to develop. In 1851 [[octroi]] was abolished and the city walls were removed to provide easier access for trade. Regular [[steamship]] links with Copenhagen had begun in 1830 and in 1862 Jutland's first railway was established between Aarhus and [[Randers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Byhistorie.dk&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Havne udsigt fra dokken.jpg|thumb|right|''Toldkammeret'' (Custom House, 1898).]]
In the second half of the 19th&amp;nbsp;century industrialisation came into full effect and a number of new industries emerged around production and refinement of agricultural products, especially oil and butter. Many companies from this time would come to leave permanent iconic marks on Aarhus. The [[Ceres Brewery]] was established in 1856 and served as Aarhus' local brewery for more than 150 years, gradually expanding into an industrial district known as Ceres-grunden (lit.: ''the Ceres-grounds'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceres.dk/Default.aspx?ID=25 |last=Ceres|title=History|accessdate=27 June 2016|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoflev.dk/article.asp?id=134|last=Ceres|title= Ceres Bryggerierne A/S|date=2013|website=Hoflev|accessdate=27 June 2016|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhusportalen.dk/ceres-grunden.asp|title=Ceres-grunden|language=Danish|publisher=Aarhusportalen (Jyllands-Posten)|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896 local farmers and businessmen created [[Korn- og Foderstof Kompagniet]] (KFK), focused on grain and [[Animal feed|feedstuffs]]. KFK established departments all over the country, while its headquarters remained in Aarhus where its large grain silos still stand today.{{sfn|Gejl|1996|p=1...}}{{sfn|Jansen|1971|p=1...}} [[Otto Mønsted]] created the Danish Preserved Butter Company in 1874, focusing on [[butter]] export to England, China and Africa and later founded the Aarhus Butterine Company in 1883, the first Danish margarine factory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Otto&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/otto-moensted-1839-1916/|author=Aarhus University|title=Otto Mønsted (1839–1916)|date=26 May 2015|accessdate=27 June 2016|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industry became an important employer, with factory employees increasing from 100 in 1896 to 1,000 in 1931, effectively transforming the city from a regional trade hub into an industrial centre.{{Sfn|Travis|1998|p=336}} Other new factories of note included the [[dockyard]] [[Aarhus Flydedok]], the [[oil mill]] [[Aarhus Oliefabrik A/S|Århus Oliefabrik]] and the [[ironworks]] [[Frichs]].

Aarhus became the largest provincial city in the country by the turn of the century and the city marketed itself as the &quot;Capital of Jutland&quot;. The population increased from 15,000 in 1870 to 52,000 in 1901 and, in response, the city annexed large land areas to develop new residential quarters such as [[Trøjborg]], [[Frederiksbjerg]] and [[Marselisborg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/registranter/frederiksbjerg/side1.htm |title=Frederiksbjerg Øst - Århus |language=Danish |author=Magistratens 2.

===Second World War===
[[File:Danish resistance fighters injured during fighting with German troops in Aarhus, Bispetorv, 5 May, 1945.jpg|thumb|right|Resistance fighters on [[Bispetorv, Aarhus|Bispetorv]] fighting with German soldiers, 5 May 1945]]
On 9 April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark, occupying Aarhus the following day and 5 years hence. The occupation was a destructive period with major disasters, loss of life and economic depression. The [[Port of Aarhus]] became a hub for supplies to the [[Baltics]] and [[Norway]] while the surrounding rail network supplied the [[Atlantic Wall]] in west Jutland and cargo headed for Germany. Combined, these factors resulted in a strong German presence, especially in 1944–45.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/Den_tyske_bes%C3%A6ttelse|title=Aarhus Besættelse|publisher=[[Vester Allé 12#Aarhus City Archives|Aarhus City Archives]]|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first years were peaceful in conjunction with the policies of the Danish [[Denmark in World War II#Protectorate Government 1940–43|Protectorate Government]], but following the enactment of the [[Communist Law]] in August 1941, the first armed resistance and sabotage commenced, gradually growing in intensity over the years with repression and terror in response.

Small, independent [[Danish resistance movement|resistance groups]] first appeared in 1941–42 but the first to coordinate with the [[Danish Freedom Council|Freedom Council]] was the [[Samsing Group]], responsible for most operations from early 1943.{{Sfn|Hansen|1946|p=13}}{{sfn|Alenius|2002|p=34}} The Samsing group, along with others in and around Aarhus, was dismantled in June 1944 when [[Grethe Bartram|Grethe &quot;Thora&quot; Bartram]] turned her family and acquaintances over to German authorities.{{Sfn|Kristensen|2010|p=52}} In response, requests for assistance was sent to contacts in [[England]] and in October 1944 the [[Royal Air Force]] [[Aarhus Air Raid|bombed the Gestapo headquarters]] successfully destroying archives and obstructing the ongoing investigation.{{sfn|Zabecki|1999|pp=1350-1}}{{Sfn|Trenear-Harvey|2009|p=2}} The [[5 Kolonne]] group was established with assistance from [[Holger Danske (resistance group)|Holger Danske]] to restore a resistance movement in Aarhus along with the [[L-groups]], tasked with assassinating collaborators.{{sfn|Hauerbach|1945|p=8}} Resistance operations escalated from mid-1944 with most major sabotage operations and assassinations occurring in the period 1944–45.{{sfn|Hauerbach|1945|p=22}}{{sfn|Knudsen|2009|p=76}} The growing resistance was countered with 19 [[Schalburgtage]] terror operations by the [[Peter group|Peter Group]] from August 1944, including large-scale fire bombings and murders. The increasingly destructive occupation was compounded when an [[1944 explosion in Aarhus|ammunition barge exploded]] in 1944, destroying much of the harbor and damaging the inner city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stiften.dk/aarhus/70-aar-siden-eksplosionen-paa-aarhus-havn|title=70 aar siden eksplosionen|publisher=[[Århus Stiftstidende]]|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 May 1945 German forces in Denmark surrendered but during the transitional period fighting broke out in Aarhus between the resistance and German soldiers resulting in 22 dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/ECE4463374/blodbad-pa-bispetorvet/|title=Blodbad på Bispetorvet|publisher=[[Jyllandsposten]]|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Order was restored by the end of the day and on 8 May the British [[1st The Royal Dragoons|Royal Dragoons]] entered the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.befrielsen1945.dk/erindringer/indsendte/205.html|title=The Royal Dragoons ankomst til Danmark|publisher=5.

===Post-World War II years===
In the 1980s the city entered a period of rapid growth and the service sector overtook trade, industry and crafts as the leading sector of employment for the first time. Workers gradually began commuting to the city from most of east and central Jutland as the region became more interconnected. The student population tripled between 1965 and 1977 turning the city into a Danish centre of research and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.au.dk/om/profil/historie/aarstal/|title=VIGTIGE ÅRSTAL|publisher=Aarhus Universitet|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing and comparably young population initiated a period of creativity and optimism; [[Gaffa (magazine)|Gaffa]] and the [[KaosPilot]] school were founded in 1983 and 1991 respectively, and Aarhus was at the centre of a renaissance in Danish rock and pop music launching bands and musicians such as [[TV-2 (band)|TV2]], [[Gnags]], [[Thomas Helmig]], [[Bamses Venner]], [[Anne Dorte Michelsen]], [[Mek Pek]] and [[Shit &amp; Chanel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dengamleby.dk/aarhusrocks/|title=Aarhus Rocks|publisher=Den Gamle By|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nordeafonden.dk/aarhus-rocks-byen-og-musikken-1960-2014|title=Byen og Musikken 1960–2914|publisher=NordeaFonden|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Jylland/Jylland_-_byer/%C3%85rhus/%C3%85rhus_(Musikliv)|title=Aarhus - rytmisk musik|publisher=[[Gyldendal]]|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 2000s ===
[[File:Aarhus docklands by night.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Urban development in Aarhus city centre, 2013]]
Since the turn of the millennium both skyline and land use has changed as former industrial sites are being redeveloped into new city districts. Starting in 2007, the former docklands are being converted to a new mixed use district dubbed &quot;Aarhus Ø&quot; ([[Aarhus Docklands]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessaarhus.dk/da/Fremtidens-Aarhus/Udviklingsomraader/Aarhus-Oe.aspx|title=Business Aarhus, Aarhus Ø|publisher=Business Aarhus|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site of the former [[Royal Unibrew]] [[Ceres Brewery|Ceres breweries]] began redevelopment in 2012 into &quot;[[CeresByen]]&quot;, a residential district with educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ceresbyen.dk/ |title=CeresByen.dk|publisher=CeresByen |accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former [[DSB (railway company)|DSB]] repair facilities at Frederiks Plads have been demolished and are being developed into a new business district with high-rise buildings scheduled for completion in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frederiksplads.dk/projekter/id%C3%A9en.aspx|title=Frederiks Plads|publisher=NCC Property Development A/S|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfmoller.com/g/Frederiks-Plads-ny-bydel-i-centrum-af-Aarhus-i13235.html|title=Frederiks Plads|publisher=C.

Accelerating growth since the early 2000s brought the inner urban area to roughly 260,000 inhabitants by 2014. The rapid growth is expected to continue until at least 2030 when Aarhus municipality has set an ambitious target for 375,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/da/aarhus/FremtidensAarhus1.aspx|title=Fremtidens Aarhus|publisher=Aarhus Kommune|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Aerial view of Aarhus 2015.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of the bay and city]]
Aarhus is located at the [[Bay of Aarhus]] facing the [[Kattegat]] sea in the east with the peninsulas of [[Mols]] and [[Helgenæs]] across the bay to the northeast. Mols and Helgenæs are both part of the larger regional peninsula of [[Djursland]]. A number of larger cities and towns is within easy reach from Aarhus by road and rail, including [[Randers]] ({{convert|38.5|km}} by road north), [[Grenå]] (northeast), [[Horsens]] ({{convert|50|km}} south) and [[Silkeborg]] ({{convert|44|km}} east).&lt;ref name=&quot;GM&quot;&gt;{{Google maps|url=http://www.freemaptools.com/how-far-is-it-between.htm|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topography===
At Aarhus' location, the Bay of Aarhus provides a natural harbour with a depth of {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} quite close to the shore.{{sfn|Olsen|2000|p=124}} Aarhus was founded at the mouth of a brackish water [[Förden and East Jutland Fjorde|fjord]], but the original fjord no longer exists, as it has gradually narrowed into what is now the [[Aarhus River]] and the [[Brabrand Lake]], due to natural [[Sediment transport#Fluvial|sedimentation]]. The land around Aarhus was once covered by forests, remains of which exist in parts of [[Marselisborg Forest]] to the south and [[Riis Skov]] to the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Jylland/Riis_Skov|title=Riis Skov|publisher=[[Gyldendal]]|accessdate=28 July 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dengamleby.dk/museum-aarhus/malerier-fra-aarhus/marselisborgskovene/ |title=Marselisborgskovene |publisher=Den Gamle By |accessdate=27 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306053230/http://www.dengamleby.dk/museum-aarhus/malerier-fra-aarhus/marselisborgskovene/ |archivedate=6 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several lakes extend west from the inner city as the landscape merges with the larger region of [[Søhøjlandet]] with heights exceeding {{convert|152|m|ft}} at [[Himmelbjerget]] between [[Skanderborg]] and [[Silkeborg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/~/media/Dokumenter/Teknik-og-Miljoe/Natur-og-Miljoe/Ud-i-naturen/Stier-og-ruter/6-infotavler-Vandreruten-Aarhus-Silkeborg.ashx|title=Vandreruten Aarhus-Silkeborg|publisher=Aarhus.dk|accessdate=1 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hilly area around Aarhus consists of a [[moraine|moranial plateau]] from the last ice age, broken by a complex system of [[tunnel valley]]s. The most prominent valleys of this network are the Aarhus Valley in the south, stretching inland east-west with the Aarhus River, Brabrand Lake, Årslev Lake and Tåstrup Lake and the [[Egå|Egå Valley]] to the north, with the stream of [[Egå]]en, the bog of [[Geding-Kasted Mose]] and Geding Lake. Most parts of the two valleys have been drained and subsequently farmed, but in the early 2000s some of the drainage was removed and parts of the wetlands were restored for environmental reasons. The valley system also includes the stream of Lyngbygård Å in the west and valleys to the south of the city, following erosion channels from the [[quaternary|pre-quaternary]]. By contrast, the Aarhus River Valley and the Giber River Valley are late [[glacial meltwater valley]]s. The coastal cliffs along the Bay of Aarhus consist of shallow [[tertiary]] clay from the [[Eocene]] and [[Oligocene]] (57 to 24 million years ago).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Danmarks_kommuner/%C3%85rhus_Kommune|title=Aarhus Kommune|publisher=[[Gyldendal]]|accessdate=19 July 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://extra.geus.info/web/nm-grundvand-brabrand-dalen.htm|title=Brabrand Dalen|publisher=[[Aarhus County]]|accessdate=9 April 2016|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ntsnet.dk/sites/default/files/%C3%85rhus%20%C3%85dal.pdf|title=Aarhus Ådal|publisher=[[Danish Ministry of Education]]|accessdate=9 April 2016|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/|title=Landskab og bebyggelse|publisher=[[Aarhus Municipality]]|accessdate=9 April 2016|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarhus is in the [[humid continental climate]] zone ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dfb'')&lt;ref name=&quot;climate-data&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.climate-data.org/country/169/|title=Climate: Denmark, Aarhus|publisher=Climate Data|language=Danish|accessdate=25 October 2016|archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6lXdMEcp3?url=http://en.climate-data.org/country/169/|archive-date=26 October 2016|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=The Köppen classification is rather course-scaled, and therefor not very useful or precise on scales the size of Denmark. We should find another climate classification system to use here. Denmark has nothing like continental climate whatsoever.|date=June 2016}} and the weather is influenced by [[low-pressure area|low-pressure systems]] from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] which result in unstable conditions throughout the year. Temperature varies a great deal across the seasons with a mild spring in April and May, warmer summer months from June to August, frequently rainy and windy autumn months in October and September and cooler winter months, often with snow and frost, from December to March. The city centre experiences the same climatic effects as other larger cities with higher wind speeds, more fog, less precipitation and higher temperatures than the surrounding, open land.&lt;ref name=&quot;WeatherOnline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/reports/climate/Denmark.htm|title=Denmark|publisher=WeatherOnline|accessdate=24 November 2014|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western winds from the Atlantic and [[North Sea]] are dominant resulting in more precipitation in western Denmark. In addition, Jutland rises sufficiently in the centre to lift air to higher, colder altitudes contributing to increased precipitation in eastern Jutland. Combined these factors make east and south Jutland comparatively wetter than other parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmi.dk/vejr/arkiver/normaler-og-ekstremer/klimanormaler-dk|title=Klimanormaler|publisher=[[Danish Meteorological Institute]]|accessdate=23 November 2014|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Average temperature over the year is {{convert|8.43|°C|0}} with February being the coldest month (0.1&amp;nbsp;°C) and August the warmest ( {{convert|15.9|C|F|disp=or}}). Temperatures in the sea can reach {{convert|17|-|22|C|F}} in June to August, but it is not uncommon for beaches to register  {{convert|25|C|F}} locally.&lt;ref name=&quot;WeatherOnline&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ditdanmark.com/article.95.html|title=The climate in Denmark|publisher=DitDanmark|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geography in the area affects the local climate of the city with the Aarhus Bay imposing a temperate effect on the low-lying valley floor where central Aarhus is located. [[Brabrand Lake]] to the west further contributes to this effect and as a result the valley has a very mild, temperate climate. The sandy ground on the valley floor dries up quickly after winter and warms faster in the summer than the surrounding hills of moist-retaining [[boulder clay]]. These conditions affect crops and plants that often bloom 1–2 weeks earlier in the valley than on the northern and southern hillsides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/index.php?title=Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Danmarks_kommuner/%C3%85rhus_Kommune|title=Aarhus Kommune|publisher=[[Gyldendal]]|accessdate=23 November 2014|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the northern latitude, the number of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 2 minutes of daylight. The difference in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter solstices is 10 hours and 30 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torbenhermansen.dk/almanak/almanak.php#|title=Sol op/ned |publisher=Almanak|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first publicly elected mayor of Aarhus was appointed in 1919. In the [[1970 Danish Municipal Reform]] the current Aarhus municipality was created by merging 20 municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/Aarhus_Kommune|title=Aarhus Kommune|publisher=Aarhus Universitet|accessdate=6 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aarhus was the seat of [[Aarhus County]] until the 2007 Danish municipal reform, which substituted the Danish counties with five regions and replaced Aarhus County with [[Central Denmark Region]] (''Region Midtjylland''), seated in [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rm.dk/om-os/|title=Om os|publisher=Region Midtjylland|accessdate=23 July 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subdivisions===
Aarhus Municipality has 45 [[electoral wards]] and [[polling station]]s in four [[electoral districts]] for the [[Folketing]] (national Parliament).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/da/politik/Valg/Find-dit-valgsted/Distrikter.aspx|title=Find dit valgsted|publisher=Aarhus Kommune|accessdate=3 August 2015|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[diocese of Aarhus]] has four [[deanery|deaneries]] composed of 60 [[parish]]es within Aarhus municipality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aarhusstift.dk/om/|title=Om Aarhus Stift|publisher=Aarhus Stift|accessdate=3 August 2015|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aarhus municipality contains 21 [[Postal code|postal districts]] and some parts of another 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postdanmark.dk/da/Documents/Lister/regionsopdelt-postnummer-excel.xls|title=Regionsopdelt Postnummer|publisher=Postdanmark|accessdate=3 August 2015|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The urban area of Aarhus and the immediate suburbs are divided into the districts [[Aarhus C]], [[Aarhus N]], [[Aarhus V]], [[Viby J]], [[Højbjerg]] and [[Brabrand]].

=== Environmental planning ===
{{Main article|Energy in Denmark}}

&lt;!--- Energy ---&gt;
Aarhus has increasingly been investing in [[environmental planning]] and, in accordance with national policy, aims to be CO2 neutral and independent of [[fossil fuel]]s for heating by 2030.&lt;ref name=&quot;Energianlaeg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aarhus.dk/sitecore/content/Subsites/affaldvarmeaarhus/Home/Varme/Varmeplan-Aarhus/Varmeproduktion/Energianlaeg-Aarhus-Oe.aspx?sc_lang=da |title=Energianlæg Aarhus Ø |publisher=[[Aarhus Municipality]] |language=Danish |accessdate=22 January 2017 |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6ni0wY7fB?url=https://www.aarhus.dk/sitecore/content/Subsites/affaldvarmeaarhus/Home/Varme/Varmeplan-Aarhus/Varmeproduktion/Energianlaeg-Aarhus-Oe.aspx?sc_lang=da |archive-date=22 January 2017 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The municipal power plants were adapted for this purpose in the 2010s. In 2015 the municipality took over 3 private [[straw]]-fired heating plants and the year after a new 77 [[Megawatt|MW]] [[combined heat and power]] biomass plant at [[Lisbjerg Power Station]] was completed while [[Studstrup Power Station]] finished a refit to move from [[coal]] to wood chips.&lt;ref name=&quot;Østjydsk Halm&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aarhus.dk/~/media/eDoc/1/3/0/1304008-1763186-1-pdf.pdf |title=Overtagelse af Østjydsk Halmvarmes halmvarmeværker |publisher=[[Aarhus Municipality]] |language=Danish |accessdate=22 January 2017 |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6nhdnhRla?url=https://www.aarhus.dk/~/media/eDoc/1/3/0/1304008-1763186-1-pdf.pdf |archive-date=22 January 2017 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Grøn varme&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aarhus.dk/sitecore/content/Subsites/affaldvarmeaarhus/Home/Om-AffaldVarme-Aarhus/NewsList/2016/3-kvartal/PM-Nu-er-varmen-groen.aspx?sc_lang=da |title=Nu er varmen grøn |publisher=[[Aarhus Municipality]] |language=Danish |accessdate=22 January 2017 |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6nhdnvF1M?url=https://www.aarhus.dk/sitecore/content/Subsites/affaldvarmeaarhus/Home/Om-AffaldVarme-Aarhus/NewsList/2016/3-kvartal/PM-Nu-er-varmen-groen.aspx?sc_lang=da |archive-date=22 January 2017 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with the development of the [[Aarhus Docklands|Docklands district]] there are plans for a utility scale seawater [[heat pump]] which will take advantage of fluctuating electricity prices to supply the [[district heating]] system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Energianlaeg&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!--- Water ---&gt;
The municipality aims for a coherent and holistic administration of the [[water cycle]] to protect against or clean up previous pollution and encourage [[green growth]] and self-sufficiency. The main issues are [[nutrient pollution|excessive nutrients]], adapting to increasing levels of precipitation brought on by [[climate change]], and securing the water supply.&lt;ref name=&quot;VandVision&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/~/media/Dokumenter/Teknik-og-Miljoe/Natur-og-Miljoe/Planer-og-projekter/Vandvision2100.ashx |title=Vand Vision 2100 |publisher=[[Aarhus Municipality]] |language=Danish |accessdate=22 January 2017 |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6ni2BPxmf?url=http://www.aarhus.dk/~/media/Dokumenter/Teknik-og-Miljoe/Natur-og-Miljoe/Planer-og-projekter/Vandvision2100.ashx |archive-date=22 January 2017 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; These goals have manifested in a number of large water treatment projects often in collaboration with private partners. In the 2000s underground rainwater basins were built across the city while the two lakes [[Brabrand Lake|Årslev Engsø]] and [[Egå Engsø]] were created in 2003 and 2006 respectively. The number of [[sewage treatment]] plants is planned to be reduced from 17 to 2 by 2025. The treatment plants in Marselisborg and Egå are planned to take over all waste treatment and have been refitted for [[biogas]] production to become net producers of electricity and heat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marspower&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2114761-worlds-first-city-to-power-its-water-needs-with-sewage-energy/|title=World’s first city to power its water needs with sewage energy|publisher=[[New Scientist]]|language=Danish|accessdate=22 January 2017|archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6ni1CM029?url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2114761-worlds-first-city-to-power-its-water-needs-with-sewage-energy/|archive-date=22 January 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Egåpower&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhusportalen.dk/nyheder-om-miljoe-og-energi.asp?AjrDcmntId=42435 |title=Epokegørende teknologi får strømmen til at flyde |publisher=[[Aarhus Municipality]] |language=Danish |accessdate=22 January 2017 |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6ni1GA0BE?url=http://www.aarhusportalen.dk/nyheder-om-miljoe-og-energi.asp?AjrDcmntId=42435 |archive-date=22 January 2017 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; To aid the new systems, sewage and [[stormwater]] throughout the municipality is planned to be separated into different systems by 2085.&lt;ref name=&quot;SepKloak&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/separatkloakering|title=Separatkloakering|publisher=[[Aarhus Municipality]]|language=Danish|accessdate=22 January 2017|archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6ni1gVtF5?url=http://www.aarhus.dk/separatkloakering|archive-date=22 January 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--- Afforestation and rewilding ---&gt;
[[Afforestation]] projects have been undertaken to prevent [[groundwater]] pollution, secure drinking water, [[carbon sequestration|sequester CO2]], increase [[biodiversity]], create an attractive countryside, provide easy access to nature and offer outdoor activities to the public. In 2000 the first project, the [[New Forests of Aarhus]], was completed which aimed to double the forest cover in the municipality and in 2009 another phase was announced to double forest cover once more before the year 2030.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skov2020&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/~/media/Dokumenter/Teknik-og-Miljoe/Natur-og-Miljoe/Park-og-skov/PDF-Vedr-skove/skovudviklingsplan-2010-2020.pdf |title=Skovudviklingsplan 2010 -2020 |publisher=[[Aarhus Municipality]] |language=Danish |accessdate=22 January 2017 |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6ni1rgL0C?url=http://www.aarhus.dk/~/media/Dokumenter/Teknik-og-Miljoe/Natur-og-Miljoe/Park-og-skov/PDF-Vedr-skove/skovudviklingsplan-2010-2020.pdf |archive-date=22 January 2017 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The afforestation plans were realized as a local project in collaboration with private landowners, under a larger national agenda.&lt;ref name=&quot;NyeSkove&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/sitecore/content/Subsites/gogreenwithaarhus/Home/Maal/Attraktiv-by/Nye-skove-sikrer-drikkevand-natur-og-friluftsliv.aspx?sc_lang=da |title=Nye skove sikrer drikkevand, natur og friluftsliv |publisher=[[Aarhus Municipality]] |language=Danish |accessdate=22 January 2017 |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6ni1sFpSc?url=http://www.aarhus.dk/sitecore/content/Subsites/gogreenwithaarhus/Home/Maal/Attraktiv-by/Nye-skove-sikrer-drikkevand-natur-og-friluftsliv.aspx?sc_lang=da |archive-date=22 January 2017 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other projects to expand natural habitats include a [[rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]] effort in [[Geding-Kasted Mose|Geding-Kasted Bog]] and continuous monitoring of the four [[Natura 2000]] areas in the municipality.

The city is home to 75 different religious groups and denominations most of which are Christian or Muslim with a smaller number of Buddhist and Hindu communities. Since the 1990s there has been a marked growth in diverse new spiritual groups although the total number of followers remains small.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aarhus 2013 religion i forandring&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religion.dk/religionsanalysen/aarhus-2013-religion-i-forandring|title=Aarhus 2013 religion i forandring|publisher=Religion|accessdate=8 December 2014|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the population are members of the Protestant state church, [[Church of Denmark]], which is by far the largest religious institution both in the city and the country as a whole. Some 20% of the population are not officially affiliated with any religion, a percentage that has been slowly rising for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://samtidsreligion.au.dk/fileadmin/Samtidsreligion/Religion_i_Aarhus_2013/online_med_forside.pdf|title=Religion_i_Aarhus_2013, s. 475|publisher=Centre for Samtidsreligion, Aarhus Universitet|accessdate=8 December 2014|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarhus has the highest ratio of immigrants in Denmark, 14.8% of the population, outside the Copenhagen area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dst.dk/pukora/epub/upload/16601/indv.pdf|title=Invandrere i Danmark 2012|publisher=Danmarks Statistik|accessdate=17 July 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s there was significant immigration from Turkey and in recent years, there has been high growth in the overall immigrant community, from 27,783 people in 1999 to 40,431 in 2008.{{sfn|Eade|Mele|2011|p=67}} The majority of immigrants have roots outside Europe and the developed world, comprising some 25,000 people from 130 different nationalities, with the largest groups coming from the Middle East and north Africa. Some 15,000 have come from within Europe, with Poland, Germany, Romania and Norway being the largest contributors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Danmarks Statistik: FOLK1&quot;/&gt;

Many immigrants have established themselves in [[Brabrand]], [[Hasle, Aarhus|Hasle]] and [[Viby J|Viby]], where the percentage of inhabitants with foreign origins has risen by 66% since the year 2000. This has resulted in several 'especially vulnerable residential areas' (a.k.a. [[ghetto]]s), with [[Gellerup]] as the most notable neighbourhood. In Brabrand and Gellerup, two thirds of the population now have a non-Danish ethnic background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/politik/ECE4470063/flere-indvandrere-til-belastede-omrader-i-arhus/|title=Flere indvandrere til belastede områder i Århus|publisher=''Jyllands Posten''|date=15 September 2008|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The international cultures present in the community are an obvious and visible part of the city's daily life and contribute many cultural flavours hitherto uncommon for the Nordic countries, including [[Bazar Vest]], a market with shopkeepers predominantly of foreign descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bazarvest.dk/Brochurer.aspx?ID=674 |title=Brochures on Bazar Vest|publisher=Bazar Vest|accessdate=10 July 2014|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:Bestseller cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Headquarters of [[Bestseller (company)|Bestseller]]]]
The economy of Aarhus is predominantly knowledge and service based, strongly influenced by the [[University of Aarhus]] and the large healthcare industry. The service sector dominates the economy and is growing as the city is transitioning away from manufacturing. Trade and transportation remain important sectors benefiting from the large port and central position on the rail network. Manufacturing has been in slow but steady decline since the 1960s while agriculture long has been a marginal employer within the municipality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dendigitalebyport.byhistorie.dk/koebstaeder/erhverv.aspx?koebstadID=74|title=Danmarks Købsteder: Århus|publisher=Den digitale byport|accessdate=8 December 2014|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The municipality is home to 175,000 jobs with some 100,000 in the private sector and the rest split between state, region and municipality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aarhus Kommune&quot;/&gt; The region is a major [[agriculture|agricultural producer]], with many large farms in the outlying districts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aarhus: Economy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bcg.thetimes.co.uk/Europe/Denmark/Aarhus#/Europe/Denmark/Aarhuseconomy|title=Aarhus: Economy|publisher=''The Times''|accessdate=23 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People commute to Aarhus from as far away as [[Randers]], [[Silkeborg]] and [[Skanderborg]] and almost a third of those employed within Aarhus municipality commute from neighbouring communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noegletal.dk/|title=Andel indpendlere|publisher=Økonomi og Indenrigsministeriet|accessdate=8 December 2014|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.blst.dk/udgiv/Publikationer/2008/978-87-92256-60-7/html/kap01.htm#1.4|title=Interaktion og infrastruktur i Østjylland|publisher=Miljøministeriet|accessdate=8 December 2014|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stiften.dk/aarhus/shoppere-stroemmer-til-byen-handle|title=Shoppere strømmer til byen|publisher=Aarhus Stiftidende|accessdate=11 December 2014|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aarhus is a center for retail in the Nordic and Baltic countries with expansive shopping centres, the busiest commercial street in the country and a dense urban core with many specialty shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/aarhus-1/?pdf=1&amp;cHash=36b812a39ba044783ca6e0ba615a1d63|title=Danmarkshistorien.dk|publisher=[[Gyldendal]]|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stroeget-aarhus.dk/index.php/stroget|title=Strøget|publisher=Strøgforeningen|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Port of Aarhus===
{{Main article|Port of Aarhus}}
[[File:Aarhus Container port.jpg|thumb|upright=1|right|Aarhus Container port]]

The Port of Aarhus is one of the largest industrial ports in [[northern Europe]] with the largest container terminal in Denmark, processing more than 50% of Denmark's container traffic and accommodating the largest container vessels in the world.&lt;ref name=aarhushavn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhushavn.dk/en/about_port_of_aarhus/about_port_of_aarhus.htm|title=About Port of Aarhus|publisher=Aarhus Havn|accessdate=16 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Signe Ferslev Pedersen&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business.dk/transport/maersk-arving-vil-kapre-mere-gods-til-aarhus|title=Mærsk-arving vil kapre mere gods til Aarhus |author =Signe Ferslev Pedersen|publisher=''Berlingske''|date=21 July 2014|accessdate=23 July 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a municipal self-governing port with independent finances. The facilities handle some 9.5 million tonnes of cargo a year (2012). Grain is the principal export, while [[animal feed|feedstuff]]s, stone, cement and [[coal]] are among the chief imports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhushavn.dk/en/about_port_of_aarhus/cargo_statistics/cargo_statistics.htm|title=Cargo statistics|publisher=Aarhus Havn|accessdate=21 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012 the port has faced increasing competition from the [[Port of Hamburg]] and freight volumes have decreased somewhat from the peak in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;Signe Ferslev Pedersen&quot;/&gt;

The ferry terminal presents the only alternative to the [[Great Belt Link]] for passenger transport between Jutland and [[Zealand]]. It has served different ferry companies since the first steamship route to Copenhagen opened in 1830. Currently [[Mols-Linien]] operates the route and annually transports some 2 million passengers and a million vehicles. Additional [[roll-on/roll-off]] cargo ferries serve [[Finland]] and [[Kalundborg]] on a weekly basis and smaller outlying Danish ports at irregular intervals. Since the early 2000s the port has increasingly become a destination for cruise lines operating in the [[Baltic Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhushavn.dk/download/formularer/aarsrapport2013.pdf|publisher=Aarhus Havn|title=Aarsrapport 2013|accessdate=9 December 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===
[[File:6144361975 f629303e7b o.jpg|thumb|right|[[Costa Pacifica]] in the harbor]]
The [[ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum|ARoS Art Museum]], the [[The Old Town, Aarhus|Old Town Museum]] and [[Tivoli Friheden]] are among Denmark's [[List of tourist attractions in Denmark|top tourist attractions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitdenmark.com/en-us/denmark/attractions/denmarks-top-attractions|title=Denmark's top attractions|publisher=Visit Denmark|accessdate=29 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With a combined total of almost 1.4 million visitors they represent the driving force behind tourism but other venues such as [[Moesgård Museum]] and [[Kvindemuseet]] are also popular. The city's extensive shopping facilities are also said to be a major attraction for tourists, as are festivals, especially [[NorthSide Festival (Denmark)|NorthSide]] and [[Spot (music festival)|SPOT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jutlandstation.dk/festivals-energize-aarhus-tourism-industry/|title=Festivals energize Aarhus' tourism industry|publisher=Jutlandstation.dk|date=13 June 2014|accessdate=29 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessaarhus.dk/~/media/Subsites/Business-Aarhus/Publikationer/Engelsk/Aarhus-as-a-Shopping-City.pdf|title=Aarhus – a city of shopping|publisher=Business Aarhus|accessdate=29 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many visitors arrive on cruise ships: in 2012, 18 vessels visited the port with over 38,000 passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhushavn.dk/en/terminals/cruise_ships_terminal/cruise_ships_terminal.htm|title=Cruise ships terminal|publisher=Aarhus Havn|accessdate=29 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010s there has been a significant expansion of tourist facilities, culminating in the opening of the 240-room Comwell Hotel in July 2014, which increased the number of hotel rooms in the city by 25%. Some estimates put the number of visitors spending at least one night as high as 750,000 a year, most of them Danes from other regions, the remainder coming mainly from Norway, Sweden, northern Germany and the United Kingdom. Overall, they spend about DKK 3 billion ($540 million) in the city each year.&lt;ref name=&quot;kulturturisme.dk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kulturturisme.dk/media/507561/Aarhus-som-kulturel-city-break-destination-final_med_logo.pdf|title=Aarhus som kulturel city destination|publisher=kulturturisme.dk|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary motivation for tourists choosing Aarhus as a destination is experiencing the city and culture, family and couples vacation or as a part of a round trip in Denmark. The average stay is little more than three days on average.&lt;ref name=&quot;kulturturisme.dk&quot;/&gt;

There are more than 30 tourist information spots across the city, some of them staffed, while others are on-line, publicly accessible touch screens. The official tourist information service in Aarhus is organised under VisitAaarhus, a corporate foundation initiated in 1994 by Aarhus Municipality and local commercial interest organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitaarhus.com/ln-int/denmark/tourist-in-aarhus|title=Tourist Information|publisher=VisitAarhus|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitaarhus.dk/aarhus/om-visitaarhus|title=Om VisitAarhus|publisher=VisitAarhus|language=Danish|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.test2.rm.dk/politik/regionsr%C3%A5dets+m%C3%B8der/visdagsorden?file=23-09-2009/Aaben_dagsorden/Bilag/Punkt_32_Bilag_2___.pdf|publisher=Region Midtjylland|title=Vedtægter for VisitAarhus|language=Danish|date=18 January 2005|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research parks===
[[File:Navitas4.jpg|thumb|[[Navitas|Navitas Park]], a department of INCUBA Science Park.]]
The largest research park in Aarhus is [[INCUBA Science Park]], focused on [[IT]] and [[biomedical research]], It is based on Denmark's first research park, ''Forskerpark Aarhus'' (Research Park Aarhus), founded in 1986, which in 2007 merged with another research park to form INCUBA Science Park. The organization is owned partly by [[Aarhus University]] and private investors and aims to foster close relationships between public institutions and startup companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://incuba.dk/om-incuba/historie/ |publisher=[[INCUBA Science Park]] |title=INCUBA Science Park - Historie |accessdate=1 October 2016 |language=Danish |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6kw4mVzBf?url=http://incuba.dk/om-incuba/historie/ |archive-date=1 October 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is physically divided across 4 locations after a new department was inaugurated in [[Navitas|Navitas Park]] in 2015, which it will share with the [[Aarhus School of Marine and Technical Engineering]] and [[AU Engineering]]. Another major center for knowledge is [[Agro Food Park]] in [[Skejby]], established to facilitate cooperation between companies and public institutions working within food science and agriculture. In January 2017 [[Arla Foods]] will open the global innovation center ''Arla Nativa'' in Agro Food Park and in 2018 Aarhus University is moving the ''Danish Centre for Food and Agriculture'' there as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dca.au.dk/aktuelt/nyheder/vis/artikel/foedevareforskningen-faar-kontor-i-agro-food-park/ |publisher=[[Aarhus University]] |title=Fødevareforskningen får kontor i Agro Food Park |accessdate=1 October 2016 |language=Danish |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6kw4nSK9j?url=http://dca.au.dk/aktuelt/nyheder/vis/artikel/foedevareforskningen-faar-kontor-i-agro-food-park/ |archive-date=1 October 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AgroFact&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agrofoodpark.dk/om-agro-food-park/fakta-om-agro-food-park|publisher=[[Agro Food Park]]|title=Fakta om Agro Food Park|language=Danish|accessdate=20 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002050010/http://www.agrofoodpark.dk/om-agro-food-park/fakta-om-agro-food-park|archive-date=2 October 2016|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 some 1000 people worked at Agro Food Park, spread across 50 companies and institutions and in August 2016 Agro Food Park management published plans to expand facilities from 92.000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to {{convert|325000|m2|sqft}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;AgroFact&quot;/&gt;

In addition, Aarhus is home to the [[Aarhus School of Architecture]], one of two Danish [[Ministry of Science, Innovation and Higher Education (Denmark)|Ministry of Education]] institutions that provide degree programs in architecture, and some of the largest architecture firms in the [[Nordic Countries]] such as [[schmidt hammer lassen architects]], [[Arkitema Architects]] and [[C. F. Møller Architects]].&lt;ref name=&quot;toft&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toft-arkitektur.dk/pdf/Arkitekturklyngen_01.03.2009.pdf |publisher=Center for Strategisk Byforskning |title=Arkitekturklyngen i Århus |accessdate=1 October 2016 |language=Danish |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6kvtGUYTd?url=http://www.toft-arkitektur.dk/pdf/Arkitekturklyngen_01.03.2009.pdf |archive-date=1 October 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taken together these organizations form a unique concentration of expertise and knowledge in architecture outside Copenhagen which the ''Danish Ministry of Business and Growth'' refer to as ''arkitekturklyngen'' (the architecture cluster). To promote the &quot;cluster&quot; the School of Architecture will be given new school buildings centrally in the new [[Aarhus Godsbanegård|Freight Station Neighborhood]], planned for development in the 2020s. In the interim the city council supports a culture, business and education center in the area which may continue in the future neighborhood in some form. The future occupants of the neighborhood will be businesses and organizations selected for their ability to be involved in the local community and it is hoped the area will evolve into a hotspot for creativity and design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arkitektforeningen.dk/node/21310 |publisher=[[Danish Association of Architects]] |title=AAØ Anbefaler Arkitektklyngen i Aarhus |accessdate=1 October 2016 |language=Danish |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6kvtHAuNW?url=https://arkitektforeningen.dk/node/21310 |archive-date=1 October 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arkitektforeningen.dk/node/25524 |publisher=[[Danish Association of Architects]] |title=Arkitekterhvervets visioner for en ny arkitektskole i Aarhus |accessdate=1 October 2016 |language=Danish |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6kvtGr4X2?url=https://arkitektforeningen.dk/node/25524 |archive-date=1 October 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stiften.dk/aarhus/gode-muligheder-for-at-bevare-jyllands-svar-paa-christiania|publisher=[[Århus Stiftstidende]]|title=Gode muligheder for at bevare Jyllands svar på Christiania|accessdate=1 October 2016 |language=Danish|archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6l72xqXeZ?url=http://stiften.dk/aarhus/gode-muligheder-for-at-bevare-jyllands-svar-paa-christiania|archive-date=8 October 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wide image|Panorama of Aarhus.jpg|1200px|Panoramic view of the Aarhus skyline seen from the top of [[ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum|ARoS]].}}
Aarhus has developed in stages, from the Viking age to modern times, all visible in the city today. Many architectural styles are represented in different parts of the city such as [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]], [[Rococo]], [[National Romantic Style|National Romantic]], [[Nordic Classicism|Nordic classicism]], [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]], [[empire style|Empire]] and [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/|title=Arkitektur og byggeskik i byen|publisher=Aarhus Kommune|accessdate=14 December 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city has grown up around the main transport hubs, the harbour and later the railway station and as a result, the oldest parts of the city are also the most central and busiest today.

The streets [[Volden, Aarhus|Volden]] (The Rampart) and [[Graven, Aarhus|Graven]] (The Moat) testify to the defences of the initial Viking settlement and ''Allégaderingen'' in [[Midtbyen, Aarhus|Midtbyen]] roughly follows the boundaries of that settlement. The street network in the [[Midtbyen (Aarhus)|inner city]] formed during the Middle Ages with narrow, curved streets and low, dense housing by the river and coast. ''Vesterport'' (Westward Gate) still bears the name of a medieval city gate and the narrow alleyways ''Posthussmøgen'' and ''Telefonsmøgen'' are remnants of toll stations from that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reader.livedition.dk/aarhuskommune/188/|title=Kulturhistorisk redegørelse 2013|publisher=Aarhus Kommune|accessdate=14 December 2014|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inner city has the oldest preserved houses, especially the [[Latinerkvarteret, Aarhus|Latin Quarter]], with buildings dating back to the early 17th&amp;nbsp;century in [[Mejlgade]] and [[Skolegade]].{{sfn|Olsen|2000|p=124}} Medieval merchants' mansions with courtyards can be seen in [[Klostergade]], [[Studsgade]] and Skolegade.

[[Aarhus Cathedral]] (''Århus Domkirke'') in the centre of Aarhus, is the longest and tallest church in Denmark at {{convert|93|m|abbr=on}} and {{convert|96|m|abbr=on}} in length and height respectively. Originally built as a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] basilica in the 13th&amp;nbsp;century, it was rebuilt and enlarged as a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] cathedral in the late 15th and early 16th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aarhusdomkirke.dk/kirkebygningen/|title=Kirkebygningen|publisher=Aarhus Domkirke|accessdate=17 July 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the cathedral stood finished around 1300, it took more than a century to build; the associated cathedral school of ''[[Aarhus Katedralskole]]'' was already founded in 1195 and ranks as the [[List of the oldest schools in the world#|44th oldest school in the world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akat.dk/historien/|title=Historien|publisher=Aarhus Katedralskole|accessdate=22 July 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important and historic church in the inner city, is the [[Church of Our Lady (Aarhus)|Church of our Lady]] (''Vor Frue Kirke'') also from the 13th&amp;nbsp;century in Romanesque and Gothic style. It is smaller and less impressive, but it was the first cathedral of Aarhus and founded on an even older church constructed in 1060; the oldest stone church in Scandinavia. Parts of this former church were excavated in the 1950s and can now be experienced as a crypt beneath the nave of ''Vor Frue Kirke''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhusvorfrue.dk/page/3416/kryptkirken|title=Kryptkirken|publisher=Vor Frue Krirke i Aarhus|accessdate=17 July 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/arkitektur_byggeskik_byen/Arkitektur_byggeskik_byen_4.htm|title=Romansk 1050–1250|publisher=Aarhus Kommune|accessdate=28 July 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/vor-frue-kirke-og-kloster/|title=Vor Frue Kirke og Kloster|publisher=Aarhus Universitet|accessdate=17 July 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/Vor_Frue_Kirke|title=Vor Frue Kirle|publisher=AarhusWiki|accessdate=17 July 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Langelandsgade Kaserne]] in [[National Romantic Style|National Romantic style]] from 1889 is the oldest former military barracks left in the country; home to the university Department of Aesthetics and Communication since 1989.

==Culture==
Aarhus is home to many annual cultural events and festivals, museums, theatres, and sport events of both national and international importance, and presents some of the largest cultural attractions in Denmark. There is a long tradition here in music of all genres and many Danish bands have emerged from Aarhus. Libraries, cultural centres and educational institutions present free or easy opportunities for the citizens to participate in, engage in, or be creative with cultural events and productions of all kinds.

Since 1938, Aarhus has marketed itself as ''Smilets by'' (City of smiles) which has become both an informal moniker and official slogan. In 2011, the city council opted to change the slogan to &quot;Aarhus. Danish for Progress&quot; but it was unpopular and abandoned after just a few years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stads_Smil&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/Smilets_by|title=Smilets by|publisher=Aarhus City Archives|language=Danish|accessdate=29 December 2016|archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6n9AzGmQm?url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/Smilets_by|archive-date=30 December 2016|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other slogans that have occasionally been used are ''Byen ved havet'' (City by the sea), ''Mellem bugt og bøgeskov'' (Between bay and beechwood) and ''Verdens mindste storby'' (World's smallest big city).&lt;ref name=&quot;Stift_Plakat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stiften.dk/kultur/Gammel-plakat-er-en-bestseller/artikel/348018|title=Gammel plakat er en bestseller|publisher=[[Århus Stiftstidende]]|language=Danish|accessdate=29 December 2016|archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6n9CsJmeZ?url=http://stiften.dk/kultur/Gammel-plakat-er-en-bestseller/artikel/348018|archive-date=30 December 2016|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ekstrabladet.dk/ferie/ferie-i-danmark/verdens-mindste-storby-hjem-til-aarhus/6449526|title=Verdens mindste storby: Hjem til Aarhus|publisher=[[Ekstra Bladet]]|language=Danish|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aarhus is featured in popular musical numbers such as ''Hjem til Aarhus'' by [[På Slaget 12]], ''Lav sol over Aarhus'' by [[Gnags]], ''8000 Aarhus C'' by [[Flemming Jørgensen]], ''Pigen ud af Aarhus'' by [[Tina Dickow]] and ''Slingrer ned ad Vestergade'' by [[Gnags]]. In 1919, the number ''Sangen til Aarhus'' (Song to Aarhus) had become a popular hit for a time, but the oldest and perhaps best known &quot;national anthem&quot; for the city is the classical ''Aarhus Tappenstreg'' from 1872 by [[Carl Christian Møller]] which is occasionally played at official events or at performances by local marching bands and orchestras.&lt;ref name=&quot;DansMus-Rødder&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ringstedfolkedansere.dk/DMR%20og%20DMH/DMR-14%20Aarhus%20Tappenstreg%20(HjLiv%201997-03).pdf|title=Arhus Tappenstreg|publisher=Dansens og musikkens rødder|language=Danish|accessdate=29 December 2016|archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6n9BBbO1X?url=http://ringstedfolkedansere.dk/DMR%20og%20DMH/DMR-14%20Aarhus%20Tappenstreg%20%28HjLiv%201997-03%29.pdf|archive-date=30 December 2016|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rosa.org/vennelystviser-sunget-af-dorthe-kollo/|title=Vennelystviser sunget af Dorthe Kollo|publisher=ROSA |language=Danish|accessdate=29 December 2016|archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6n9BLxWiz?url=https://www.rosa.org/vennelystviser-sunget-af-dorthe-kollo/|archive-date=30 December 2016|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarhus has a range of museums, including [[List of tourist attractions in Denmark|two of the largest]] in the country measured by the number of visitors, ''[[Den Gamle By]]'' and ''[[ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum]]''.
''Den Gamle By'' (The Old Town), officially ''Danmarks Købstadmuseum'' (Denmark's Market Town Museum), presents Danish townscapes from the 16th&amp;nbsp;century to the 1970s with individual areas focused on different time periods. 75 historic buildings collected from different parts of the country have been brought here to create a small town in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Museumsv%C3%A6sen/Historiske_museer_og_samlinger/Den_Gamle_By|title=Den Gamle By|publisher=[[Gyldendal]]|accessdate=19 July 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dengamleby.dk/udforsk-den-gamle-by/nye-tider-1927/|title=Nye tider 1927|publisher=Den Gamle By|accessdate=19 July 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dokk1 version 3.jpg|thumb|[[Dokk1]] at the harbour front]]

===Parks, nature and recreation===
{{see also|List of parks in Aarhus}}
[[File:RisskovStrand.jpg|thumb|Beaches such as [[Bellevue Beach, Aarhus|Bellevue Beach]] forms the entire coastline]]
The beech forests of [[Riis Skov]] and [[Marselisborg Forest|Marselisborg]] occupy the hills along the coast to the north and south, and apart from the city centre, sandy beaches form the coastline of the entire municipality. There are two public seabaths, the northern ''[[Den Permanente]]'' below Riis Skov and close to the harbor area, and the southern [[Ballehage Beach]] in the Marselisborg Forests. As in most of Denmark, there are no private beaches in the municipality, but access to ''Den Permanente'' requires a membership, except in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitaarhus.dk/aarhus/natur/en-tur-paa-stranden|title=En Tur På Stranden|publisher=VisitAarhus|accessdate=10 December 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarhus has a robust and diverse nightlife. The action tends to concentrate in the inner city, with the pedestrianized riverside, Frederiksgade, the Latin Quarter and Jægergårdsgade on Frederiksbjerg as the most active centres at night, but things are stirring elsewhere around the city too. The nightlife scene offers everything from small joints with cheap alcohol and a homely atmosphere to fashionable night clubs serving champagne and cocktails or small and large music venues with bars, dance floors and lounges.  A short selection of well-established places where you can have a drink and socialise, include the fashionable lounge and night club of ''Kupé'' at the harbour front, the relaxed ''Ris Ras Filliongongong'' offering [[hookah|waterpipes]] and an award-winning beer selection, ''Fatter Eskild'' with a broad selection of Danish bands playing mostly blues and rock, the [[wine bar|wine]] and [[book café]] of ''Løve's'' in Nørregade, ''Sherlock Holmes'', a British-style [[pub]] with live music and the [[brew pub]] of ''Sct. Clemens'' with [[A Hereford Beefstouw]] restaurant across the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loeves.dk/bogcafe/omtale.php|title=Omtale|publisher=Loeves|language=Danish|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ale.dk/index.php?id=495|title=Serving in Aarhus|publisher=Danske Ølentusiaster (Aarhus C)|language=Danish|accessdate=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Porter|Prince|2007|p=372}}  There are several clubs, discos and cafés aimed at gays and lesbians, including ''Danish D-lite'' (sports), ''Gbar'' ([[nightclub]]) and ''Gaia Vandreklub'' (hiking club).

The ''Århus Set'' ([[Danish language|Danish]]: Århus Sæt) is a set of drinks often ordered together, named for the city and consisting of two beverages, one [[Ceres Brewery|Ceres Top]] beer and one shot [[Arnbitter]], both originally from Aarhus.

===Local dialect===
{{see also|Danish dialects}}
The Aarhus dialect, commonly called ''Aarhusiansk'' ([[Literal translation|Lit.]]: ''Aarhusian''), is a [[Jutlandic dialect]] ([[Danish language|Danish]]: Jysk) in the [[Danish dialects|Mid-Eastern Jutland dialect area]], traditionally spoken in and around Aarhus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dialekt.ku.dk/dialekter/jysk/ |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6eak3iK3G?url=http://dialekt.ku.dk/dialekter/jysk/ |archive-date=17 January 2016 |title=Jysk |publisher=[[University of Copenhagen]] |language=Danish |accessdate=6 January 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aarhusian, as most local dialects in Denmark, has diminished in use through the 20th century and most people today speak some version of Standard Danish with regional features although it still has a strong presence in older segments of the population and in areas with high numbers of immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/ECE1852264/saarn-bevarer-etniske-unge-aarhusiansk-ikkaa/ |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6eakufFAw?url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/ECE1852264/saarn-bevarer-etniske-unge-aarhusiansk-ikkaa/ |archive-date=17 January 2016 |title=Saarn bevarer etniske unge ikkaa |publisher=[[Politiken]] |language=Danish |accessdate=6 January 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stiften.dk/dagens-portraet/hun-fandt-den-aarhusianske-dialekt-i-aarhus-v |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6ealB7CWw?url=http://stiften.dk/dagens-portraet/hun-fandt-den-aarhusianske-dialekt-i-aarhus-v |archive-date=17 January 2016 |title=Hun fandt den Aarhusianske dialekt i Aarhus V |publisher=[[Århus Stiftstidende]] |language=Danish |accessdate=6 January 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stiften.dk/aarhus/vi-snakker-mindre-aarhusiansk-do |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6ealHbWPb?url=http://stiften.dk/aarhus/vi-snakker-mindre-aarhusiansk-do |archive-date=17 January 2016 |title=Vi snakker mindre Aarhusiansk do |publisher=[[Århus Stiftstidende]] |language=Danish |accessdate=6 January 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Common or traditional Aarhusian words are: træls (tiresome), noller (silly or dumb) and dælme ([[Phrasal exclamation|Excl]]. damn me).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.information.dk/284790 |title=Aarhus — engelsk for noller |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6ealV4Iqr?url=http://www.information.dk/284790 |archive-date=17 January 2016 |publisher=[[Dagbladet Information]] |language=Danish |accessdate=6 January 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://odt.hum.ku.dk/dokumenter/Glargaard__Amalie.__2014_._Tr_ls_-_dialekt_eller_standardsprog._Eksamensopgave.pdf |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6eannJkqR?url=http://odt.hum.ku.dk/dokumenter/Glargaard__Amalie.__2014_._Tr_ls_-_dialekt_eller_standardsprog._Eksamensopgave.pdf |archive-date=17 January 2016 |title=Træls - dialekt eller standardsprog |publisher=[[University of Copenhagen]] |language=Danish |accessdate=15 January 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dialect is notable for single syllable words ending in &quot;d&quot; being pronounced with [[stød]] while the same letter in multiple syllable words is pronounced as &quot;j&quot;, i.e..

Aarhus is the principal centre for education in the Jutland region. It draws students from a large area, especially from the western and southern parts of the peninsula. The relatively large influx of young people and students creates a natural base for cultural activities.&lt;ref name=etb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australia.etbnews.com/117939/aarhus-denmarks-city-of-smiles-3/|title=Aarhus, Denmark's City Of Smiles|publisher=ETB News|accessdate=26 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aarhus has the greatest concentration of students in Denmark, fully 12% of those living there attending short, medium or long courses of study.

Regarding air transport, Aarhus is served by the [[Aarhus Airport]] in Tirstrup about 35&amp;nbsp;km northeast of the city centre.

Aarhus has a free bike sharing system, [[Aarhus Bycykler]] (Aarhus City Bikes). The bicycles are available from 1 April to 30 October at 57 stands throughout the city and can be obtained by placing a DKK 20 coin in the release slot, like caddies in a supermarket. The coin can be retrieved when the bike is returned. Bicycles can also be hired from many shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/sitecore/content/Subsites/AarhusBycykel/Home/English.aspx|title=Aarhus City Bikes|publisher=Aarhus Kommune|accessdate=29 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healthcare===
[[File:Jydske Asyl.jpg|thumb|[[Risskov Psychiatric Hospital]]]]
Aarhus is home to [[Aarhus University Hospital]], one of six Danish &quot;Super Hospitals&quot; officially established in 2007 when [[Regions of Denmark|the regions]] reformed the Danish healthcare sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danskekommuner.dk/Global/Artikelbilleder/2015/DK-3/DK-3-side-26-27.pdf |title=Supersygehus |publisher=[[Aarhus Municipality]] |accessdate=22 April 2016 |language=Danish |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/6gxkXvjy7?url=http://www.danskekommuner.dk/Global/Artikelbilleder/2015/DK-3/DK-3-side-26-27.pdf |archive-date=22 April 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The university hospital is the result of a series of mergers in the 2000s between the former hospitals [[Skejby Sygehus]], the [[Aarhus Municipal Hospital|Municipal Hospital]], the [[Aarhus County Hospital|County Hospital]], [[Marselisborg Hospital]] and [[Jydske Asyl|Risskov Psychiatric Hospital]].

Private hospitals specialized in different areas from plastic surgery to fertility treatments operate in Aarhus as well. ''Ciconia Aarhus Private Hospital'' founded in 1984 is a leading Danish fertility clinic and the first of its kind in Denmark.

==Media==
[[File:Stiften.jpg|thumb|left|The headquarters of local newspaper [[Århus Stiftstidende]] at the central station.]]
[[File:Soesterhoej.jpg|thumb|The Aarhus [[Søsterhøj]] TV tower, height {{convert|261|m|abbr=on}}]]
The first daily newspaper to appear in Aarhus was ''[[Århus Stiftstidende]]'', established in 1794 as ''Aarhuus Stifts Adresse-Contoirs Tidender'', with a moderately conservative approach. Once one of Denmark's largest,{{sfn|Cremo|2010|p=230}} it was a leading provincial newspaper for a time, but after the Second World War it increasingly faced competition from ''[[Demokraten (1873)|Demokraten]]'' (1884–1974) and ''Jyllands-Posten'', both published in Aarhus. In 1998, it merged with ''Randers Amtsavis'' and is now run by Midtjyske Medier, part of [[Berlingske Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Massemedier/Medier_og_dagblade,_Danmark/%C3%85rhus_Stiftstidende|title=Århus Stiftstidende|publisher=[[Gyldendal]]|accessdate=21 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The daily newspaper of ''Jyllandsposten'' (today known as ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'') was established in 1871 in Aarhus, and takes a generally right-wing editorial approach. With a reputation as a serious news publication, the paper has always included news from [[Jutland]] in particular, but somewhat less so since its promotion as a national newspaper (''Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten'') in the 1960s. Today it is one of the three leading serious newspapers in Denmark, the others being ''[[Berlingske]]'' and ''[[Politiken]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Massemedier/Medier_og_dagblade,_Danmark/Jyllands-Posten|title=Jyllands-Posten|publisher=[[Gyldendal]]|accessdate=21 July 2014|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jyllands-Posten publishes ''JP Aarhus'', a section dedicated to news in and around Aarhus, and the free cityguide website of ''Aarhusportalen'' (The Aarhus Portal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/|title=JP Aarhus|publisher=Jyllands-Posten|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhusportalen.dk/|title=Aarhusportalen|publisher=Jyllands-Posten|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Copenhagen-based media company of ''Politiken'', also publishes several free local papers once a week in parts of Denmark and Sweden. In Aarhus, they publish a total of five local newspapers; ''Aarhus Midt'', ''Aarhus Nord'', ''Aarhus Vest'', ''Aarhus Syd'' and ''Aarhus Weekend''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

[[Danmarks Radio]] has a large department in Aarhus with over 200 employees. It runs the DR Østjylland radio programme, provides local contributions to [[DR P4]], and produces local regional television programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dr.dk/Om_DR/Besoeg_DR/2013/09/03130303.htm|title=Rundvisning i DR Aarhus|publisher=DR|date=3 September 2013|accessdate=21 July 2014|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, [[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV 2]] established its Jutland headquarters in [[Randers]] but moved to [[Skejby]] in northern Aarhus in 1999. The station broadcasts regional news and current affairs television and radio programmes. Since 2012, it has run its own TV channel, [[TV 2/Østjylland|TV 2 Østjylland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv2oj.dk/artikel/48749:Om-TV-2---OeSTJYLLAND--Oejeblikke-paa-TV2OJ|title=Få overblikket over de første 20 år med TV 2|publisher=tv2oj.dk TV 2 {{pipe}} ØSTJYLLAND|accessdate=21 July 2014|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aarhus has its own local TV channel TVAarhus, transmitting since 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv3aarhus.dk/Om_TV3_Ost/om_tv3_ost.html|title=Om TV3 Øst|publisher=TVAarhus|language=Danish|accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antenneforeningen-aarhus.dk/tvaarhus.aspx|title=Om TVAarhus|publisher=Antenneforeningen Aarhus|language=Danish|accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an agreement on 1 July 2014, TVAarhus can be watched by 130,000 households in Aarhus, making it the largest cable-transmitted local TV channel in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dinby.dk/aarhus-onsdag/dobbelt-saa-mange-kan-nu-se-tvaarhus|title=Dobbelt så mange kan nu se TVAarhus|publisher=Aarhus Onsdag, Århus Stifstidende|language=Danish|date=1 August 2014|accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With over 1,700 students, the [[Danish School of Media and Journalism]] (''Danmarks Medie- og Journalisthøjskole'') is the country's largest and oldest school of journalism. The school works closely with Aarhus University where the first journalism course was established in 1946. In 2004, the two institutions established the Centre for University Studies in Journalism, which offers master's courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mundusjournalism.com/universities/uni-dsj|title=The Danish School of Media and Journalism|publisher=Erasmus Mundus Master's in Journalism, Media and Globalisation|accessdate=21 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
