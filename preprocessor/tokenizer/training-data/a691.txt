'''''Amaranthus''''', collectively known as '''amaranth''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Amaranthaceae {{!}} plant family|url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/18481/Amaranthaceae#ref230955|accessdate = 2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] [[genus]] of [[annual plant|annual]] or short-lived [[perennial plant]]s. Some amaranth species are cultivated as [[leaf vegetable]]s, [[pseudocereal]]s, and [[ornamental plant]]s. Most of the ''Amaranthus'' species are summer annual weeds and are commonly referred to as [[pigweed]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Bensch&quot;&gt;Bensch et al. (2003).

Members of this genus share many characteristics and uses with members of the closely related genus ''[[Celosia]]''.

&quot;Amaranth&quot; derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀμάραντος}}&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)ma/rantos|ἀμάραντος|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''amárantos''), &quot;unfading&quot;, with the Greek word for &quot;flower&quot;, {{lang|grc|ἄνθος}} (''ánthos''), factoring into the word's development as ''amaranth''. ''Amarant'' is an archaic variant.

''Amaranthus'' shows a wide variety of morphological diversity among and even within certain species. Although the family ([[Amaranthaceae]]) is distinctive, the [[genus]] has few distinguishing characters among the 70 species included.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiple&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1095-8339.2007.00665.x | author = Juan | year = 2007 | title = Electrophoretic characterization of ''Amaranthus'' L. seed proteins and its systematic implication | url = | journal = Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society | volume = 155 | issue = | pages = 57–63 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This complicates [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and ''Amaranthus'' has generally been considered among systematists as a &quot;difficult&quot; genus.&lt;ref name = &quot;Costea&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3088717 | author = Costea M, DeMason D | year = 2001 | title = Stem morphology and anatomy in Amaranthus L.

Formerly, Sauer (1955) classified the genus into two subgenera, differentiating only between [[Plant sexual morphology#Individual plant morphology|monoecious]] and [[Plant sexual morphology#Individual plant morphology|dioecious]] species: ''Acnida'' (L.) Aellen ex K.R. Robertson and ''Amaranthus''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Costea&quot; /&gt; Although this classification was widely accepted, further infrageneric classification was (and still is) needed to differentiate this widely diverse group.

Currently, ''Amaranthus'' includes three recognized subgenera and 70 species, although species numbers are questionable due to [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] and species concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Judd et al. (2008). ''Plant Systematics: A Phylogenetic Approach'', Third Edition. Sinauer Associates, Inc. Sunderland, MA&lt;/ref&gt; Infrageneric classification focuses on inflorescence, flower characters and whether a species is monoecious/dioecious, as in the Sauer (1955) suggested classification.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiple&quot; /&gt; A modified infrageneric classification of ''Amaranthus'' was published by Mosyakin &amp; Robertson (1996) and includes three subgenera: ''Acnida'', ''Amaranthus'', and ''Albersia''. The taxonomy is further differentiated by sections within each of the subgenera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mosyakin &amp; Robertson |year=1996 |title=New infrageneric taxa and combinations in ''Amaranthus'' (Amaranthaceae) |journal=Ann.

== Human uses ==

=== History ===
Known to the [[Aztecs]] as ''huauhtli'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Coe, S.D.|year=1994|title=America's First Cuisines|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292711594|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=guKnUdrLhtYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; amaranth is thought to have represented up to 80% of their energy consumption before the Spanish conquest. Another important use of amaranth throughout [[Mesoamerica]] was to prepare ritual drinks and foods. To this day, [[amaranth grain]]s are toasted much like popcorn and mixed with honey, molasses, or chocolate to make a treat called ''alegría'', meaning &quot;joy&quot; in Spanish. [[Diego Durán]] described the festivities for [[Huitzilopochtli]], the name of which means &quot;hummingbird of the left side&quot; or &quot;left-handed hummingbird&quot; (Real hummingbirds feed on amaranth flowers). The Aztec month of [[Aztec calendar|Panquetzaliztli]] (7 December to 26 December) was dedicated to Huitzilopochtli.  People decorated their homes and trees with paper flags; ritual races, processions, dances, songs, prayers, and finally human sacrifices were held. This was one of the more important Aztec festivals, and the people prepared for the whole month. They fasted or ate very little; a statue of the god was made out of amaranth seeds and honey, and at the end of the month, it was cut into small pieces so everybody could eat a little piece of the god. After the Spanish conquest, cultivation of amaranth was outlawed, while some of the festivities were subsumed into the Christmas celebration.

Because of its importance as a symbol of indigenous culture, its gluten-free palatability, ease of cooking, and a protein that is particularly well-suited to human nutritional needs, interest in grain amaranth (especially ''A. cruentus'' and ''A. hypochondriacus'') revived in the 1970s. It was recovered in Mexico from wild varieties and is now commercially cultivated. It is a popular snack sold in Mexico, sometimes mixed with chocolate or puffed rice, and its use has spread to Europe and parts of North America.  Amaranth and [[quinoa]] are not grasses and are called [[pseudocereal]]s because of their similarities to cereals in flavor and cooking.

=== Seed ===
Several species are raised for amaranth [[pseudograin|&quot;grain&quot;]] in Asia and the Americas.

Ancient amaranth grains still used include the three species, ''[[Amaranthus caudatus]]'', ''[[Amaranthus cruentus]]'', and ''[[Amaranthus hypochondriacus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Costea et al. (2006). Delimitation of ''A. cruentus'' L. and ''A. caudatus'' L. using micromorphology and AFLP analysis: an application in germplasm identification. Genetic Resources and Crop Evolution 53: 1625-1633.&lt;/ref&gt; Although amaranth was cultivated on a large scale in ancient Mexico, Guatemala, and Peru, nowadays it is only cultivated on a small scale there, along with India, China, Nepal, and other tropical countries; thus, the potential exists for further cultivation in those countries, as well as in the U.S. In a 1977 article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', amaranth was described as &quot;the crop of the future&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Marx (1977). Speaking of Science: Amaranth: A Comeback for the Food of the Aztecs? Science 198(4312): 40.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed as an inexpensive native crop that could be cultivated by indigenous people in rural areas for several reasons:
* It is easily harvested.
* Its seeds are a good source of protein.&lt;ref name=mpoll&gt;De Macvean &amp; Pöll (1997). Chapter 8: Ethnobotany. Tropical Tree Seed Manual, USDA Forest Service, edt. J.A Vozzo.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tucker/&gt;
* In cooked and edible forms, amaranth retains adequate content of several [[dietary minerals]].&lt;ref name=usdamrth&gt;{{cite web|title=USDA National Nutrient Database: cooked amaranth grain per 100 grams; Full report |url=http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/6474?fg=&amp;man=&amp;lfacet=&amp;count=&amp;max=&amp;sort=&amp;qlookup=&amp;offset=&amp;format=Full&amp;new=&amp;measureby=|date=2014|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is easy to cook.
* As befits its weedy life history, amaranth grains grow rapidly and, in three cultivated species of amaranth, their large seedheads can weigh up to 1 kg and contain a half-million small seeds.&lt;ref name = &quot;Tucker&quot;&gt;Tucker, J. (1986). Amaranth: the once and future crop. Bioscience 36(1): 9-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--original research === Seed flour ===

Amaranth seed flour has been evaluated as an additive to wheat flour by food specialists. To determine palatability, different levels of amaranth grain flour were mixed with the wheat flour and baking ingredients (1% salt, 2.5% fat, 1.5% yeast, 10% sugar, and 52–74% water), fermented, molded, pan-proofed, and baked. The baked products were evaluated for loaf volume, moisture content, color, odor, taste, and texture. The amaranth-containing products were then compared with bread made from 100% wheat flour. The loaf volume decreased by 40% and the moisture content increased from 22 to 42% with increase in amaranth grain flour. The study found that the sensory scores of the taste, odor, color, and texture decreased with increasing amounts of amaranth. Generally, above 15% amaranth grain flour, significant differences occurred in the evaluated sensory qualities and the high amaranth-containing product was found to be of unacceptable palatability to the population sample that evaluated the baked products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The effect of amaranth grain flour on the quality of bread|author=Jerome Ayo|doi=10.1081/JFP-100105198|journal=International Journal of Food Properties|year=2001|volume=4|issue=2|pages=341|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1081/JFP-100105198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leaves, roots, and stems ===

Amaranth species are cultivated and consumed as a [[leaf vegetable]] in many parts of the world. Four species of ''Amaranthus'' are documented as cultivated vegetables in eastern Asia: ''[[Amaranthus cruentus]]'', ''[[Amaranthus blitum]], [[Amaranthus dubius]]'', and ''[[Amaranthus tricolor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Costea (2003). Notes on Economic Plants. ''Economic Botany'' 57(4): 646-649&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indonesia and Malaysia, leaf amaranth is called ''bayam''. In the Philippines, the [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] word for the plant is ''kalunay''; the Tagalog word for the plant is ''kilitis'' or ''kulitis''. In Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in India, it is called ''chaulai'' and is a popular green leafy vegetable (referred to in the class of vegetable preparations called ''[[saag]]''). It is called ''chua'' in Kumaun area of Uttarakhand, where it is a popular red-green vegetable. In Karnataka in India, it is called ''harive''. It is used to prepare curries such as'' hulee, palya, majjigay-hulee'', and so on. In Kerala, it is called ''cheera'' and is consumed by stir-frying the leaves with spices and red chillies to make ''cheera [[thoran]]''. In Tamil Nadu, it is called ''mulaikkira'' and is regularly consumed as a favourite dish, where the greens are steamed, and mashed, with light seasoning of salt, red chili, and cumin. It is  called ''keerai masial''.  In Andhra Pradesh, this leaf is added in preparation of a popular ''[[dal]]'' called ''thotakura pappu'' in ([[Telugu language|Telugu]]). In Maharashtra, it is called ''shravani maath'' and is available in both red and white colour. In Orissa, it is called ''khada saga'', it is used to prepare ''saga bhaja'', in which the leaf is fried with chili and onions.

In China, the leaves and stems are used as a stir-fry vegetable, or in soups. In Vietnam, it is called ''rau dền'' and is used to make [[soup]]. Two species are popular as edible vegetable in Vietnam: ''dền đỏ''- ''Amaranthus tricolor'' and ''dền cơm'' or ''dền trắng''- ''Amaranthus viridis''.

A traditional food plant in Africa, amaranth has the potential to improve nutrition, boost [[food security]], foster rural development and support sustainable land care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink= |author=National Research Council |others= |title=Lost Crops of Africa: Volume II: Vegetables |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11763 |format= |accessdate=2008-07-15 |edition= |series=Lost Crops of Africa |volume=2 |date=2006-10-27 |publisher=National Academies Press |location= |isbn=978-0-309-10333-6 |oclc=34344933 |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter=Amaranth |chapterurl=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11763&amp;page=35 |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bantu regions of Uganda and western Kenya, it is known as ''doodo'' or ''litoto''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | author=Goode, P. M. | title=Edible plants of Uganda | publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations  | year=1989| isbn= 9789251027134|pages=25–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known among the [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] as a [[drought]] crop (''chepkerta''). In [[Lingala language|Lingala]] (spoken in the Congo), it is known as ''lɛngalɛnga'' or ''bítɛkutɛku''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Enama, M. |year=1994 |title=Culture: The missing nexus in ecological economics perspective |journal=Ecological Economics |issue=10 |pages=93–95 |doi=10.1016/0921-8009(94)00010-7 |volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Nigeria, it is a common vegetable and goes with all Nigerian starch dishes. It is known in [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] as ''shoko'' a short form of ''shokoyokoto'' (meaning make the husband fat) or ''arowo jeja'' (meaning &quot;we have money left over for fish&quot;). In the Caribbean, the leaves are called ''bhaji'' in Trinidad and ''callaloo'' in Jamaica, and are sautéed with onions, garlic, and tomatoes, or sometimes used in a soup called pepperpot soup. In Botswana, it is referred to as ''morug'' and cooked as a staple green vegetable.

In Greece, green amaranth (''A. viridis'') is a popular dish called βλήτα, ''vlita'' or ''vleeta''. It is boiled, then served with olive oil and lemon juice like a salad, sometimes alongside fried fish. Greeks stop harvesting the plant (which also grows wild) when it starts to bloom at the end of August.

In Brazil, green amaranth was, and to a degree still is, frequently regarded as an invasive species as all other species of amaranth (except the generally imported ''A. caudatus'' cultivar), though some have traditionally appreciated it as a leaf vegetable, under the names of {{lang|pt|''caruru''}} or {{lang|pt|''bredo''}}, which is consumed cooked, generally accompanying the staple food, [[rice and beans]].

=== Dyes ===

The flowers of the 'Hopi Red Dye' amaranth were used by the [[Hopi]] (a tribe in the western United States) as the source of a deep red [[natural dye|dye]].  Also a synthetic dye was named &quot;[[Amaranth (dye)|amaranth]]&quot; for its similarity in color to the natural amaranth [[pigment]]s known as [[betalain]]s. This synthetic dye is also known as Red No. 2 in North America and E123 in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The following color additives are not authorized for use in food products in the United States: (1) Amaranth (C.I. 16185, EEC No. E123, formerly certifiable as FD&amp;C red No. 2);&quot; [http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~comm/cp03803.html FDA/CFSAN Food Compliance Program: Domestic Food Safety Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ornamentals ===
[[File:Amaranthus flowers.jpg|thumb|Amaranthus flowering]]
The genus also contains several well-known ornamental plants, such as ''Amaranthus caudatus'' (love-lies-bleeding), a vigorous, hardy annual with dark purplish [[flower]]s crowded in handsome drooping spikes. Another Indian annual, ''A. hypochondriacus'' (prince's feather), has deeply veined, lance-shaped leaves, purple on the under face, and deep crimson flowers densely packed on erect spikes.

Amaranths are recorded as food plants for some [[Lepidoptera]] ([[butterfly]] and [[moth]]) species including the [[Nutmeg (moth)|nutmeg moth]] and various case-bearer moths of the genus ''[[Coleophora]]'': ''C. amaranthella'', ''C. enchorda'' (feeds exclusively on ''Amaranthus''), ''C. immortalis'' (feeds exclusively on ''Amaranthus''), ''C. lineapulvella'', and ''C. versurella'' (recorded on ''A. spinosus'').

== Ecology ==

Amaranth weed species have an extended period of germination, rapid growth, and high rates of seed production,&lt;ref name = &quot;Bensch&quot;/&gt; and have been causing problems for farmers since the mid-1990s. This is partially due to the reduction in [[tillage]], reduction in herbicidal use and the evolution of herbicidal resistance in several species where herbicides have been applied more often.&lt;ref&gt;Wetzel et al. (1999). Use of PCR-based molecular markers to identify weedy Amaranthus species. Weed Science 47: 518-523.&lt;/ref&gt; The following 9 species of ''Amaranthus'' are considered invasive and noxious weeds in the U.S and Canada: ''A. albus'', ''A. blitoides'', ''A. hybridus'', ''A. palmeri'', ''A. powellii'', ''A. retroflexus'', ''A. spinosus'', ''A. tuberculatus'', and ''A. viridis''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=AMARA USDA Plant Database. Plants Profile- ''Amaranthus'' L]&lt;/ref&gt;

A new herbicide-resistant strain of ''[[Amaranthus palmeri]]'' has appeared; it is [[glyphosate]]-resistant and so cannot be killed by herbicides using the chemical. Also, this plant can survive in tough conditions. This could be of particular concern to [[cotton]] farmers using glyphosate-resistant cotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.organicconsumers.org/ge/cotton060404.cfm|title=Herbicide Resistant Weeds Causing Problems for US Cotton Growers|work=organicconsumers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species ''Amaranthus palmeri'' (Palmer amaranth) causes the greatest reduction in [[soybean]] yields and has the potential to reduce yields by 17-68% in field experiments.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bensch&quot;/&gt; Palmer amaranth is among the &quot;top five most troublesome weeds&quot; in the southeast of the United States and has already evolved resistances to [[dinitroaniline]] herbicides and [[acetolactate synthase inhibitor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Culpepper et al. (2006). Glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth (''Amaranthus palmeri'') confirmed in Georgia. Weed Science 54: 620-626.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the proper identification of ''Amaranthus'' species at the seedling stage essential for agriculturalists. Proper weed control needs to be applied before the species successfully colonizes in the crop field and causes significant yield reductions.
