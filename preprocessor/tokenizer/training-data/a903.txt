== History ==
=== Biological antibiotics derived from molds ===
{{See also|Timeline of antibiotics}} {{See also|History of penicillin}}
Substances with antibiotic properties had been used for various purposes since ancient times.

[[File:Penicillin core.svg|thumb|170px|[[Penicillin]], the first natural antibiotic discovered by [[Alexander Fleming]] in 1928]]
Before the early 20th century, treatments for infections were based primarily on [[folk medicine|medicinal folklore]]. Mixtures with antimicrobial properties that were used in treatments of infections were described over 2000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Considerations for Determining if a Natural Product Is an Effective Wound-Healing Agent&quot;/&gt; Many ancient cultures, including the [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|ancient Egyptians]] and [[Ancient Greek medicine|ancient Greeks]], used specially selected [[mold]] and plant materials and extracts to treat [[infection]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Early history of wound treatment&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Moulds in ancient and more recent medicine&quot;/&gt; More recent observations made in the laboratory of antibiosis between microorganisms led to the discovery of natural antibacterials produced by microorganisms. [[Louis Pasteur]] observed, &quot;if we could intervene in the antagonism observed between some bacteria, it would offer perhaps the greatest hopes for therapeutics&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kingston2008&quot;/&gt;

In 1874, physician Sir [[William Roberts (physician)|William Roberts]] noted that cultures of the mold ''[[Penicillium glaucum]]'' that is used in the making of some types of [[blue cheese]] did not display bacterial contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foster|first1=William|last2=Raoult|first2=Alain|title=History of Medicine: Early descriptions of antibiosis|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2157443/pdf/jroyalcgprac00228-0073.pdf |accessdate=31 January 2017|pages=889–94|quote=the first scientific observations of the antagonistic actions of various micro-organisms were made ... by William Roberts of Manchester (1874) and John Tyndall of London (1876).|pmc=2157443|pmid=4618289|volume=24|date=December 1974|journal=J R Coll Gen Pract}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, physicist [[John Tyndall]] also contributed to this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foster|first1=William|last2=Raoult|first2=Alain|title=History of Medicine: Early descriptions of antibiosis|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2157443/pdf/jroyalcgprac00228-0073.pdf |accessdate=31 January 2017|pages=889–94|quote=Both Roberts and Tyndall indicated that the Penicillium molds had some property or had an activity which inhibited bacterial growth.|pmc=2157443|pmid=4618289|volume=24|date=December 1974|journal=J R Coll Gen Pract}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasteur conducted research showing that ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' would not grow in the presence of the related mold ''[[Penicillium notatum]]''.

In 1895 [[Vincenzo Tiberio]], Itallian physician, published a paper on the antibacterial power of some extracts of mold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bucci|first=Roberto|last2=Gallì|first2=Paola|date=2012-05-11|title=Public Health History Corner Vincenzo Tiberio: a misunderstood researcher|url=http://ijphjournal.it/article/view/5688|journal=Italian Journal of Public Health|language=en|volume=8|issue=4|issn=1723-7815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, doctoral student [[Ernest Duchesne]] submitted a dissertation, &quot;Contribution à l'étude de la concurrence vitale chez les micro-organismes: antagonisme entre les moisissures et les microbes&quot; (Contribution to the study of vital competition in micro-organisms: antagonism between molds and microbes),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duchesne|first1=Ernest|last2=Witty|first2=Michael (Translator)|title=Duchesne's Antagonism between molds and bacteria, an English Colloquial Translation|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DZVXPIK|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first known scholarly work to consider the therapeutic capabilities of molds resulting from their anti-microbial activity. In his thesis, Duchesne proposed that bacteria and molds engage in a perpetual battle for survival. Duchesne observed that ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' was eliminated by ''Penicillium glaucum'' when they were both grown in the same culture. He also observed that when he [[Inoculation|inoculated]] laboratory animals with lethal doses of [[typhoid]] bacilli together with ''Penicillium glaucum'', the animals did not contract typhoid. Unfortunately Duchesne's army service after getting his degree prevented him from doing any further research.&lt;ref name=&quot;Academic Press&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Straand|first1=Jørund|last2=Gradmann|first2=Christoph|last3=Simonsen|first3=Gunnar Skov|last4=Lindbæk|first4=Morten|title=International Encyclopedia of Public Health: Antibiotic Development and Resistance|date=2008|publisher=Academic Press|pages=200|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/page/Arsphenamine|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duchesne died of [[tuberculosis]], a disease now treated by antibiotics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Academic Press&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Alexander Fleming.jpg|thumb|left|Alexander Fleming was awarded a Nobel prize for his role in the discovery of penicillin]]In 1928, Sir [[Alexander Fleming]] identified [[penicillin]], a molecule produced by certain molds that kills or stops the growth of certain kinds of bacteria. Fleming was working on a culture of [[pathogen|disease-causing]] bacteria when he noticed the [[spore]]s of a green mold, ''[[Penicillium chrysogenum]]'', in one of his [[agar plate|culture plates]]. He observed that the presence of the mold killed or prevented the growth of the bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tan|first=Siang Yong|last2=Tatsumura|first2=Yvonne|date=1 July 2015|title=Alexander Fleming (1881–1955): Discoverer of penicillin|journal=Singapore Medical Journal|volume=56|issue=7|pages=366–367|doi=10.11622/smedj.2015105|issn=0037-5675|pmc=4520913|pmid=26243971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleming postulated that the mold must secrete an antibacterial substance, which he named penicillin in 1928.  Fleming believed that its antibacterial properties could be exploited for chemotherapy. He initially characterized some of its biological properties, and attempted to use a crude preparation to treat some infections, but he was unable to pursue its further development without the aid of trained chemists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fleming1929&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sykes2001&quot;/&gt;

[[Ernst Chain]], [[Howard Florey]] and [[Edward Abraham]] succeeded in purifying the first penicillin, [[penicillin G]], in 1942, but it did not become widely available outside the Allied military before 1945. Later, [[Norman Heatley]] developed the back extraction technique for efficiently purifying penicillin in bulk. The chemical structure of penicillin was first proposed by Abraham in 1942&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=David S.|last2=Jones|first2=John H.|date=1 December 2014|title=Sir Edward Penley Abraham CBE. 10 June 1913 – 9 May 1999|url=http://rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/60/5.1|journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society|language=en|volume=60|pages=5–22|doi=10.1098/rsbm.2014.0002|issn=0080-4606}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then later confirmed by [[Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin]] in 1945. Purified penicillin displayed potent antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria and had low toxicity in humans. Furthermore, its activity was not inhibited by biological constituents such as pus, unlike the synthetic [[sulfonamides]]. (see below) The discovery of such a powerful antibiotic was unprecedented, and the development of penicillin led to renewed interest in the search for antibiotic compounds with similar efficacy and safety.&lt;ref name=&quot;Use of Micro-organisms for therapeutic purposes&quot;/&gt; For their successful development of penicillin, which Fleming had accidentally discovered but could not develop himself, as a therapeutic drug, Chain and Florey shared the 1945 [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] with Fleming.

Florey credited [[Rene Dubos]] with pioneering the approach of deliberately and systematically searching for antibacterial compounds, which had led to the discovery of gramicidin and had revived Florey's research in penicillin.&lt;ref name=Epps2006/&gt; In 1939, coinciding with the start of [[World War II]], Dubos had reported the discovery of the first naturally derived antibiotic, [[tyrothricin]], a compound of 20% [[gramicidin]] and 80% [[tyrocidine]], from ''B. brevis.'' It was one of the first commercially manufactured antibiotics and was very effective in treating wounds and ulcers during World War II.&lt;ref name=&quot;Epps2006&quot;/&gt; Gramicidin, however, could not be used systemically because of toxicity. Tyrocidine also proved too toxic for systemic usage. Research results obtained during that period were not shared between the [[Axis powers|Axis]] and the [[Allied powers of World War II|Allied powers]] during World War II and limited access during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Capocci|first=Mauro|date=1 January 2014|title=Cold drugs.

=== Synthetic antibiotics derived from dyes ===
Synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy as a science and development of antibacterials began in Germany with [[Paul Ehrlich]] in the late 1880s.&lt;ref name=&quot;CALDERIN2007&quot;/&gt; Ehrlich noted certain dyes would color human, animal, or bacterial cells, whereas others did not. He then proposed the idea that it might be possible to create chemicals that would act as a selective drug that would bind to and kill bacteria without harming the human host. After screening hundreds of dyes against various organisms, in 1907, he discovered a medicinally useful drug, the first synthetic antibacterial [[salvarsan]]&lt;ref name=&quot;CALDERIN2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Limbird2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosch2008&quot;/&gt; now called arsphenamine.
[[File:Paul Ehrlich and Sahachiro Hata.jpg|thumb|left|Dr. [[Paul Ehrlich]] and Dr. [[Sahachiro Hata]] ]]
The era of antibacterial treatment began with the discoveries of arsenic-derived synthetic antibiotics by [[Alfred Bertheim]] and Ehrlich in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams KJ | title = The introduction of 'chemotherapy' using arsphenamine – the first magic bullet | journal = J R Soc Med | volume = 102 | issue = 8 | pages = 343–8 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19679737 | pmc = 2726818 | doi = 10.1258/jrsm.2009.09k036 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;goodman&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goodman |first1=Louis S. |author-link1=Louis S.

While their early compounds were too toxic, Ehrlich and [[Sahachiro Hata]], a Japanese bacteriologist working with Erlich in the quest for a drug to treat [[syphilis]], achieved success with the 606th compound in their series of experiments. In 1910 Ehrlich and Hata announced their discovery, which they called drug &quot;606&quot;, at the Congress for Internal Medicine at [[Wiesbaden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jmvh.org&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frith|first1=John|title=Arsenic – the &quot;Poison of Kings&quot; and the &quot;Saviour of Syphilis&quot;|journal=Journal of Military and Veterans' Health|volume=21|issue=4|url=http://jmvh.org/article/arsenic-the-poison-of-kings-and-the-saviour-of-syphilis/|accessdate=31 January 2017|publisher=Australasian Military Medicine Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]] company began to market the compound toward the end of 1910 under the name Salvarsan.  This drug is now known as [[arsphenamine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jmvh.org&quot;/&gt; The drug was used to treat syphilis in the first half of the 20th century. In 1908, Ehrlich received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for his contributions to [[immunology]].&lt;ref name=nobel&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1908/ehrlich-bio.html The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1908, Paul Erlich – Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; Hata was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1911 and for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1912 and 1913.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=3941 Sachachiro Hata – Nomination Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]] and the first [[wikt:systemic|systemically]] active antibacterial drug, [[Prontosil]], was developed by a research team led by [[Gerhard Domagk]] in 1932 or 1933 at the [[Bayer]] Laboratories of the [[IG Farben]] conglomerate in Germany,&lt;ref name=&quot;goodman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aminov RI | title = A brief history of the antibiotic era: lessons learned and challenges for the future | journal = [[Frontiers in Microbiology]] | volume = 1 | pages = 134 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21687759 | pmc = 3109405 | doi = 10.3389/fmicb.2010.00134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosch2008&quot;/&gt; for which Domagk received the 1939 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1939/press.html |title=Physiology or Medicine 1939 – Presentation Speech |publisher=Nobel Foundation |accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sulfanilamide, the active drug of Prontosil, was not patentable as it had already been in use in the dye industry for some years.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Prontosil had a relatively broad effect against [[Gram-positive]] [[Coccus|cocci]], but not against [[Enterobacteriaceae|enterobacteria]]. Research was stimulated apace by its success.

Antibiotics are used to treat or prevent bacterial infections,&lt;ref name=Antibiotic&gt;{{cite book|title=Antibiotics Simplified.|date=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=9781449614591|pages=15–17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIRgA57q414C&amp;dq=Antibiotics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes [[protozoan infection]]s. ([[Metronidazole]] is effective against a number of [[parasitic disease]]s). When an infection is suspected of being responsible for an illness but the responsible pathogen has not been identified, an [[empiric therapy]] is adopted.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leekha|first=Surbhi|last2=Terrell|first2=Christine L.|last3=Edson|first3=Randall S.|date=1 February 2011|title=General principles of antimicrobial therapy|journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings|volume=86|issue=2|pages=156–167|doi=10.4065/mcp.2010.0639|issn=1942-5546|pmc=3031442|pmid=21282489}}&lt;/ref&gt; This involves the administration of a [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]] based on the signs and symptoms presented and is initiated pending laboratory results that can take several days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Antibiotic&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

When the responsible pathogenic microorganism is already known or has been identified, [[therapy#Definitive therapy|definitive therapy]] can be started. This will usually involve the use of a narrow-spectrum antibiotic. The choice of antibiotic given will also be based on its cost. Identification is critically important as it can reduce the cost and toxicity of the antibiotic therapy and also reduce the possibility of the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; To avoid surgery, antibiotics may be given for non-complicated acute [[appendicitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rollins|first1=KE|last2=Varadhan|first2=KK|last3=Neal|first3=KR|last4=Lobo|first4=DN|title=Antibiotics Versus Appendicectomy for the Treatment of Uncomplicated Acute Appendicitis: An Updated Meta-Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials.|journal=World journal of surgery|date=19 May 2016|pmid=27199000|doi=10.1007/s00268-016-3561-7|volume=40|pages=2305–2318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antibiotics may be given as a [[preventive healthcare|preventive measure]] (prophylactic) and this is usually limited to at-risk populations such as those with a [[immunodeficiency|weakened immune system]] (particularly in [[HIV]] cases to prevent [[pneumonia]]), those taking [[immunosuppressive drug]]s, [[cancer]] patients and those having [[surgery]].&lt;ref name=Antibiotic /&gt; Their use in surgical procedures is to help prevent infection of [[surgical incision|incisions]] made. They have an important role in [[dental antibiotic prophylaxis]] where their use may prevent [[bacteremia]] and consequent [[infective endocarditis]].

===Administration===
There are different [[routes of administration]] for antibiotic treatment.  Antibiotics are usually [[oral administration|taken by mouth]]. In more severe cases, particularly deep-seated [[systemic disease|systemic infection]]s, antibiotics can be given [[intravenous therapy|intravenously]] or by injection.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHSB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Where the site of infection is easily accessed, antibiotics may be given [[routes of administration#Topical|topically]] in the form of [[eye drop]]s onto the [[conjunctiva]] for [[conjunctivitis]] or [[ear drop]]s for ear infections and acute cases of [[otitis externa|swimmer's ear]].  Topical use is also one of the treatment options for some skin conditions including [[acne vulgaris|acne]] and [[cellulitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pangilinan|first=Ronald|last2=Tice|first2=Alan|last3=Tillotson|first3=Glenn|date=1 October 2009|title=Topical antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections: review of the literature|journal=Expert Review of Anti-Infective Therapy|volume=7|issue=8|pages=957–965|doi=10.1586/eri.09.74|issn=1744-8336|pmid=19803705}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advantages of topical application include achieving high and sustained concentration of antibiotic at the site of infection; reducing the potential for systemic absorption and toxicity, and total volumes of antibiotic required are reduced, thereby also reducing the risk of antibiotic misuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lipsky|first=Benjamin A.|last2=Hoey|first2=Christopher|date=15 November 2009|title=Topical antimicrobial therapy for treating chronic wounds|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|volume=49|issue=10|pages=1541–1549|doi=10.1086/644732|issn=1537-6591|pmid=19842981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topical antibiotics applied over certain types of surgical wounds have been reported to reduce the risk of surgical site infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heal|first=Clare F|last2=Banks|first2=Jennifer L|last3=Lepper|first3=Phoebe D|last4=Kontopantelis|first4=Evangelos|last5=van Driel|first5=Mieke L|title=Topical antibiotics for preventing surgical site infection in wounds healing by primary intention|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011426.pub2/full|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2016|issue=11|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011426.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are certain general causes for concern with topical administration of antibiotics. Some systemic absorption of the antibiotic may occur; the quantity of antibiotic applied is difficult to accurately dose, and there is also the possibility of local [[hypersensitivity]] reactions or [[contact dermatitis]] occurring.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

==Side-effects==
[[File:Choosing Wisely antibiotics poster small English.pdf|thumb|right|Health advocacy messages such as this one encourage patients to talk with their doctor about safety in using antibiotics.]]
Antibiotics are screened for any negative effects before their approval for clinical use, and are usually considered safe and well tolerated. However, some antibiotics have been associated with a wide extent of adverse [[side effect]]s ranging from mild to very severe depending on the type of antibiotic used, the microbes targeted, and the individual patient.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15993671&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Antibiotics and Selective Toxicity – Boundless Open Textbook|url = https://www.boundless.com/microbiology/textbooks/boundless-microbiology-textbook/antimicrobial-drugs-13/overview-of-antimicrobial-therapy-153/antibiotics-and-selective-toxicity-773-727/|website = Boundless|access-date = 12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Side effects may reflect the pharmacological or toxicological properties of the antibiotic or may involve hypersensitivity or [[allergy|allergic]] reactions.&lt;ref name=Antibioticandantiprotozal&gt;{{cite book|title=Chemical Analysis of Antibiotic Residues in Food.|date=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=9781449614591|pages=1–60|url=http://www.newbooks-services.de/MediaFiles/Texts/6/9780470490426_Excerpt_001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions, including [[photodermatitis]] and [[anaphylaxis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antibiotics – Side effects |website=NHS Choices |publisher=National Health Service (NHS), UK |url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Antibiotics-penicillins/Pages/Side-effects.aspx |date=6 May 2014 |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Safety profiles of newer drugs are often not as well established as for those that have a long history of use.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15993671&quot;/&gt;

Common side-effects include [[diarrhea]], resulting from disruption of the species composition in the [[intestinal flora]], resulting, for example, in overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, such as ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea – All you should know |accessdate=28 December 2014|url=http://www.bestnaturalremedies.net/antibiotic-associated-diarrhea}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibacterials can also affect the [[vaginal flora]], and may lead to overgrowth of [[yeast]] species of the genus ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]'' in the vulvo-vaginal area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pirotta and Garland&quot;/&gt; Additional side-effects can result from [[drug interaction|interaction]] with other drugs, such as the possibility of [[tendon]] damage from the administration of a [[quinolone antibiotic]] with a systemic [[corticosteroid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Trevor|last2=Cook|first2=Jill|title=Fluoroquinolones and Tendinopathy: A Guide for Athletes and Sports Clinicians and a Systematic Review of the Literature|journal=Journal of Athletic Training|date=1 January 2014|volume=49|issue=3|pages=422–427|doi=10.4085/1062-6050-49.2.09|pmc=4080593|issn=1062-6050|pmid=24762232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposure to antibiotics early in life is associated with increased body mass in humans and mouse models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Adding weight to the microbiota's role in obesity—exposure to antibiotics early in life can lead to increased adiposity|last = Ray|first = Katrina|date = September 2012|journal = Nature Reviews Endocrinology|doi = 10.1038/nrendo.2012.173|volume=8|pages=623}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early life is a critical period for the establishment of the [[Gut flora|intestinal microbiota]] and for [[Metabolism|metabolic]] development.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Microbiota, Antibiotics, and Obesity|last = Jess|first = Tine|date = December 2014|journal = The New England Journal of Medicine|doi = 10.1056/NEJMcibr1409799|volume=371|pages=2526–2528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mice exposed to subtherapeutic antibiotic treatment (STAT)– with either penicillin, [[vancomycin]], or [[chlortetracycline]] had altered composition of the gut microbiota as well as its metabolic capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Antibiotics in early life alter the murine colonic microbiome and adiposity|last = Cho|first = Ilseung|date = August 2012 |journal = Nature|doi = 10.1038/nature11400|pmid =22914093 |pmc=3553221  |display-authors=etal |volume=488 |pages=621–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study has reported that mice given low-dose penicillin (1 μg/g body weight) around birth and throughout the [[weaning]] process had an increased body mass and fat mass, accelerated growth, and increased [[hepatic]] expression of [[gene]]s involved in [[adipogenesis]], compared to control mice.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Altering the intestinal microbiota during a critical developmental window has lasting metabolic consequences |last = Cox|first = Laura |date = 14 August 2014 |journal = Cell |volume=158 |issue=4|pages=705–21|doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2014.05.052 |pmid = 25126780 |pmc=4134513 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, penicillin in combination with a high-fat diet increased fasting [[insulin]] levels in mice.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; However, it is unclear whether or not antibiotics cause [[obesity]] in humans.

Although there is a correlation between antibiotic use in early life and obesity, the effect of antibiotics on obesity in humans needs to be weighed against the beneficial effects of clinically indicated treatment with antibiotics in infancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==Interactions==

===Birth control pills===
Well controlled studies on the effect of [[oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptive]] failure and antibiotics are very limited.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Keri C.|last2=Schwartz|first2=Michael D.|last3=Lieu|first3=Siam O.|date=1 January 2013|title=Antibiotics and OC effectiveness|journal=JAAPA: official journal of the American Academy of Physician Assistants|volume=26|issue=1|pages=11|issn=1547-1896|pmid=23355994|doi=10.1097/01720610-201301000-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of studies indicate antibiotics do not interfere with [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Weaver1999&quot;/&gt; such as clinical studies that suggest the failure rate of contraceptive pills caused by antibiotics is very low (about 1%).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10384856&quot;/&gt; Situations that may increase the risk of oral contraceptive failure include [[Compliance (medicine)|non-compliance]] (missing taking the pill), vomiting or diarrhea.

In cases where antibiotics have been suggested to affect the efficiency of birth control pills, such as for the broad-spectrum antibiotic [[rifampicin]], these cases may be due to an increase in the activities of hepatic liver enzymes' causing increased breakdown of the pill's active ingredients.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weaver1999&quot; /&gt; Effects on the intestinal flora, which might result in reduced absorption of [[estrogen]]s in the colon, have also been suggested, but such suggestions have been inconclusive and controversial.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid3155374&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid2256523&quot; /&gt; Clinicians have recommended that extra contraceptive measures be applied during therapies using antibiotics that are suspected to interact with oral [[contraceptives]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Weaver1999&quot; /&gt; More studies on the possible interactions between antibiotics and birth control pills (oral contraceptives) are required as well as careful assessment of patient-specific risk factors for potential oral contractive pill failure prior to dismissing the need for backup contraception.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt;

===Alcohol===
Interactions between alcohol and certain antibiotics may occur and may cause side-effects and decreased effectiveness of antibiotic therapy.&lt;ref name=&quot;bmj&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;antibiotics-and-alcohol&quot;/&gt; While moderate alcohol consumption is unlikely to interfere with many common antibiotics, there are specific types of antibiotics with which alcohol consumption may cause serious side-effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHS&quot; /&gt; Therefore, potential risks of side-effects and effectiveness depend on the type of antibiotic administered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=Alison A.|last2=Whiteman|first2=Elizabeth J.|last3=Ward|first3=Katherine T.|title=Risks of Combined Alcohol-Medication Use in Older Adults|journal=The American journal of geriatric pharmacotherapy|date=1 March 2007|volume=5|issue=1|pages=64–74|pmc=4063202|issn=1543-5946|pmid=17608249|doi=10.1016/j.amjopharm.2007.03.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmacodynamics==
{{Main article|Antimicrobial pharmacodynamics}}
The successful outcome of antimicrobial therapy with antibacterial compounds depends on several factors. These include [[Immune system|host defense mechanisms]], the location of infection, and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the antibacterial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pankey2004&quot;/&gt; A bactericidal activity of antibacterials may depend on the bacterial growth phase, and it often requires ongoing metabolic activity and division of bacterial cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bactericidal action of daptomycin against stationary-phase and nondividing Staphylococcus aureus cells&quot;/&gt; These findings are based on laboratory studies, and in clinical settings have also been shown to eliminate bacterial infection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pankey2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Pelczar MJ, Chan EC, Krieg NR |year=2010 |contribution=Host-Parasite Interaction; Nonspecific Host Resistance |title=Microbiology Concepts and Applications |edition=6th |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |pages=478–479}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the activity of antibacterials depends frequently on its concentration,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhee2004&quot;/&gt; ''in vitro'' characterization of antibacterial activity commonly includes the determination of the [[minimum inhibitory concentration]] and minimum bactericidal concentration of an antibacterial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pankey2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Agar and broth dilution methods to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)of antimicrobial substances&quot;/&gt;

===Combination therapy===

In important infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, [[combination therapy]] (i.e., the concurrent application of two or more antibiotics) has been used to delay or prevent the emergence of resistance. In acute bacterial infections, antibiotics as part of combination therapy are prescribed for their [[Drug synergy|synergistic]] effects to improve treatment outcome as the combined effect of both antibiotics is better than their individual effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ocampo|first=Paolo S.|last2=Lázár|first2=Viktória|last3=Papp|first3=Balázs|last4=Arnoldini|first4=Markus|last5=Abel zur Wiesch|first5=Pia|last6=Busa-Fekete|first6=Róbert|last7=Fekete|first7=Gergely|last8=Pál|first8=Csaba|last9=Ackermann|first9=Martin|date=1 August 2014|title=Antagonism between bacteriostatic and bactericidal antibiotics is prevalent|journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy|volume=58|issue=8|pages=4573–4582|doi=10.1128/AAC.02463-14|issn=1098-6596|pmc=4135978|pmid=24867991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bollenbach|first=Tobias|date=1 October 2015|title=Antimicrobial interactions: mechanisms and implications for drug discovery and resistance evolution|journal=Current Opinion in Microbiology|volume=27|pages=1–9|doi=10.1016/j.mib.2015.05.008|issn=1879-0364|pmid=26042389}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus]] infections may be treated with a combination therapy of [[fusidic acid]] and rifampicin.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; Antibiotics used in combination may also be antagonistic and the combined effects of the two antibiotics may be less than if the individual antibiotic was given as part of a [[monotherapy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; For example, [[chloramphenicol]] and [[tetracyclines]] are antagonists to [[penicillins]] and [[aminoglycosides]].

==Classes==
{{Main article|List of antibiotics}}
[[File:Antibiotics action.svg|right|thumb|150px|Molecular targets of antibiotics on the bacteria cell]]

Antibiotics are commonly classified based on their [[mechanism of action]], [[chemical structure]], or spectrum of activity. Most target bacterial functions or growth processes.&lt;ref name=&quot;CALDERIN2007&quot;/&gt; Those that target the bacterial cell wall ([[penicillin]]s and [[cephalosporin]]s) or the cell membrane ([[polymyxin]]s), or interfere with essential bacterial enzymes ([[rifamycin]]s, [[lipiarmycin]]s, [[Quinolone antibiotic|quinolones]], and [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]]) have [[Bactericide|bactericidal]] activities. [[Protein synthesis inhibitor]]s ([[macrolide]]s, [[lincosamides]] and [[tetracycline]]s) are usually [[bacteriostatic]] (with the exception of bactericidal [[aminoglycoside]]s).&lt;ref name=&quot;The importance of bactericidal drugs: future directions in infectious disease&quot;/&gt; Further categorization is based on their target specificity. &quot;Narrow-spectrum&quot; antibiotics target specific types of bacteria, such as [[gram-negative]] or [[gram-positive]], whereas [[broad-spectrum antibiotics]] affect a wide range of bacteria. Following a 40-year break in discovering new classes of antibacterial compounds, four new classes of antibiotics have been brought into clinical use in the late 2000s and early 2010s: cyclic [[lipopeptide]]s (such as [[daptomycin]]), [[glycylcyclines]] (such as [[tigecycline]]), [[oxazolidinone]]s (such as [[linezolid]]), and [[lipiarmycin]]s (such as [[fidaxomicin]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cunha BA.

==Production==
{{Main article|Production of antibiotics}}
With advances in [[medicinal chemistry]], most modern antibacterials are [[semisynthetic]] modifications of various natural compounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nussbaum2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=von Nussbaum|first1=Franz|last2=Brands|first2=Michael|last3=Hinzen|first3=Berthold|last4=Weigand|first4=Stefan|last5=Häbich|first5=Dieter|title=Antibacterial Natural Products in Medicinal Chemistry—Exodus or Revival?|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|date=4 August 2006|volume=45|issue=31|pages=5072–5129|doi=10.1002/anie.200600350|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.200600350/abstract;jsessionid=1D843B672707790C436223082CDC24FC.f04t02|accessdate=3 August 2016|language=en|issn=1521-3773|pmid=16881035}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include, for example, the [[beta-lactam antibiotics]], which include the [[penicillin]]s (produced by fungi in the genus ''[[Penicillium]]''), the [[cephalosporin]]s, and the [[carbapenem]]s.

Since the first pioneering efforts of [[Howard Florey]] and [[Ernst Boris Chain|Chain]] in 1939, the importance of antibiotics, including antibacterials, to [[medicine]] has led to intense research into producing antibacterials at large scales. Following screening of antibacterials against a wide range of bacteria, production of the active compounds is carried out using [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]], usually in strongly aerobic conditions.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Resistance==
{{Main article|Antibiotic resistance}}

[[File:Human neutrophil ingesting MRSA.jpg|thumb|left|[[Scanning electron micrograph]] of a human [[neutrophil]] ingesting [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA)]]

The emergence of resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is a common phenomenon. Emergence of resistance often reflects [[evolution]]ary processes that take place during antibiotic therapy. The antibiotic treatment may [[Natural selection|select]] for bacterial strains with physiologically or genetically enhanced capacity to survive high doses of antibiotics. Under certain conditions, it may result in preferential growth of resistant bacteria, while growth of susceptible bacteria is inhibited by the drug.&lt;ref name=&quot;Balancing the drug-resistance equation&quot;/&gt; For example, antibacterial selection for strains having previously acquired antibacterial-resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943 by the [[Luria–Delbrück experiment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mutations of Bacteria from Virus Sensitivity to Virus Resistance&quot;/&gt; Antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin, which used to have a high efficacy against many bacterial species and strains, have become less effective, due to the increased resistance of many bacterial strains.&lt;ref name=&quot;voanews.com&quot;/&gt;

Resistance may take the form of biodegredation of pharmaceuticals, such as sulfamethazine-degrading soil bacteria introduced to sulfamethazine through medicated pig feces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Topp E, Chapman R, Devers-Lamrani M, Hartmann A, Marti R, Martin-Laurent F, Sabourin L, Scott A, Sumarah M | title = Accelerated Biodegradation of Veterinary Antibiotics in Agricultural Soil following Long-Term  {{subst:lc:Exposure}}, and Isolation of a Sulfamethazine-degrading sp | journal = J. Environ. Qual. | volume = 42 | issue = 1 | pages = 173–8 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23673752 | doi = 10.2134/jeq2012.0162 | url = http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/abstract/?id=27587000000610 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The survival of bacteria often results from an inheritable resistance,&lt;ref name=&quot;Witte2004&quot;/&gt; but the growth of resistance to antibacterials also occurs through [[horizontal gene transfer]]. Horizontal transfer is more likely to happen in locations of frequent antibiotic use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dyer|first=Betsey Dexter|title=A Field Guide To Bacteria|year=2003|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8854-2|chapter=Chapter 9, Pathogens|url=http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_1?asin=B002VA8L4Y&amp;qid=1305345229&amp;sr=1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antibacterial resistance may impose a biological cost, thereby reducing [[biological fitness|fitness]] of resistant strains, which can limit the spread of antibacterial-resistant bacteria, for example, in the absence of antibacterial compounds. Additional mutations, however, may compensate for this fitness cost and can aid the survival of these bacteria.&lt;ref name=&quot;The biological cost of mutational antibiotic resistance: any practical conclusions?&quot;/&gt;

Paleontological data show that both antibiotics and antibiotic resistance are ancient compounds and mechanisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;D'Costa2011&quot;/&gt; Useful antibiotic targets are those for which mutations negatively impact bacterial reproduction or viability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladki2013&quot;/&gt;

Several molecular mechanisms of antibacterial resistance exist. Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alekshun2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Nature Communications|volume=7|pages= 1–10|date=December 2016 | doi= 10.1038/ncomms13803|title=A diverse intrinsic antibiotic resistome from a cave bacterium|last1=Pawlowski |first1=Andrew C| last2=Wang|first2=Wenliang |last3=Koteva|first3=Kalinka| last4=Barton|first4=Hazel| last5=McArthur |first5=Andrew G| last6=Wright|first6=Gerard D| pmid=27929110}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial [[genome]]. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alekshun2007&quot;/&gt; Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been transferred to, antibacterial-resistant strains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glycopeptide antibiotic resistance genes in glycopeptide-producing organisms&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Multidrug Resistance in Bacteria&quot;/&gt; The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by [[Horizontal gene transfer|horizontal genetic exchange]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Witte2004&quot;/&gt; For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via [[plasmids]] that carry these resistance genes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Witte2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker2006&quot;/&gt; Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker2006&quot;/&gt; Cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker2006&quot;/&gt;

Antibacterial-resistant strains and species, sometimes referred to as &quot;superbugs&quot;, now contribute to the emergence of diseases that were for a while well controlled. For example, emergent bacterial strains causing tuberculosis that are resistant to previously effective antibacterial treatments pose many therapeutic challenges. Every year, nearly half a million new cases of [[multidrug-resistant tuberculosis]] (MDR-TB) are estimated to occur worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2009/tuberculosis_drug_resistant_20090402/en/index.html Health ministers to accelerate efforts against drug-resistant TB]&quot;.

===Misuse===
[[File:CDC Get Smart poster healthy adult.png|thumb|This poster from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &quot;Get Smart&quot; campaign, intended for use in doctors' offices and other healthcare facilities, warns that antibiotics do not work for viral illnesses such as the common cold.]]

{{main article|Antibiotic misuse}}

Per ''The ICU Book'' &quot;The first rule of antibiotics is try not to use them, and the second rule is try not to use too many of them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marino&quot;/&gt; Inappropriate antibiotic treatment and overuse of antibiotics have contributed to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. [[Self-prescribing|Self prescription]] of antibiotics is an example of misuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson2007&quot;/&gt; Many antibiotics are frequently prescribed to treat symptoms or diseases that do not respond to antibiotics or that are likely to resolve without treatment. Also, incorrect or suboptimal antibiotics are prescribed for certain bacterial infections.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15993671&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson2007&quot;/&gt; The overuse of antibiotics, like penicillin and erythromycin, has been associated with emerging antibiotic resistance since the 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;voanews.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawkey2008&quot;/&gt; Widespread usage of antibiotics in hospitals has also been associated with increases in bacterial strains and species that no longer respond to treatment with the most common antibiotics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawkey2008&quot;/&gt;

Common forms of antibiotic misuse include excessive use of [[prophylaxis|prophylactic]] antibiotics in travelers and failure of medical professionals to prescribe the correct dosage of antibiotics on the basis of the patient's weight and history of prior use. Other forms of misuse include failure to take the entire prescribed course of the antibiotic, incorrect dosage and administration, or failure to rest for sufficient recovery. Inappropriate antibiotic treatment, for example, is their prescription to treat viral infections such as the [[common cold]]. One study on [[respiratory tract infection]]s found &quot;physicians were more likely to prescribe antibiotics to patients who appeared to expect them&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17467120&quot;/&gt; Multifactorial interventions aimed at both physicians and patients can reduce inappropriate prescription of antibiotics.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17509729&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coxeter|first1=Peter|title=Interventions to facilitate shared decision making to address antibiotic use for acute respiratory infections in primary care|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=11 November 2015|volume=11|pmid=26560888|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010907.pub2/abstract|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010907.pub2|pages=CD010907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several organizations concerned with antimicrobial resistance are lobbying to eliminate the unnecessary use of antibiotics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson2007&quot;/&gt; The issues of misuse and overuse of antibiotics have been addressed by the formation of the US Interagency Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance. This task force aims to actively address antimicrobial resistance, and is coordinated by the US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), and the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), as well as other US agencies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pharmguide&quot;/&gt; An NGO campaign group is ''Keep Antibiotics Working''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keep Antibiotics Working&quot;/&gt; In France, an &quot;Antibiotics are not automatic&quot; government campaign started in 2002 and led to a marked reduction of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, especially in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sabuncu E, David J, Bernède-Bauduin C, Pépin S, Leroy M, Boëlle PY, Watier L, Guillemot D |title=Significant reduction of antibiotic use in the community after a nationwide campaign in France, 2002–2007 |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=e1000084 |year=2009 |pmid=19492093 |pmc=2683932 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000084 |url=http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000084 |editor1-last=Klugman |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uJyYYA93?url=http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000084 |deadurl=no |editor1-first=Keith P. |archivedate=18 November 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of antibiotic resistance has prompted restrictions on their use in the UK in 1970 (Swann report 1969), and the EU has banned the use of antibiotics as growth-promotional agents since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legaltext.ee/text/en/T80294.htm |title=Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109031010/http://www.legaltext.ee/text/en/T80294.htm |archivedate=9 January 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, several organizations (including the World Health Organization, the [[National Academy of Sciences]], and the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]) have advocated restricting the amount of antibiotic use in food animal production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consumersunion.org/news/the-overuse-of-antibiotics-in-food-animals-threatens-public-health-2/ |accessdate=4 July 2016 |title=The Overuse of Antibiotics in Food Animals Threatens Public Health |publisher=Consumer Reports}}{{MEDRS|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, commonly there are delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibiotics, attributable partly to resistance against such regulation by industries using or selling antibiotics, and to the time required for research to test causal links between their use and resistance to them. Two federal bills (S.742&lt;ref name=&quot;USbill1&quot;/&gt; and H.R. 2562&lt;ref name=&quot;USbill2&quot;/&gt;) aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in US food animals were proposed, but have not passed.&lt;ref name=&quot;USbill1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USbill2&quot;/&gt; These bills were endorsed by public health and medical organizations, including the American Holistic Nurses' Association, the American Medical Association, and the American Public Health Association (APHA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.acpm.org/2003051H.pdf |accessdate= 12 November 2008 |title=Kee Antibiotics Working|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325225525/http://www.acpm.org/2003051H.pdf |archivedate=25 March 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite pledges by food companies and restaurants to reduce or eliminate meat that comes from animals treated with antibiotics, the purchase of antibiotics for use on farm animals has been increasing every year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/12/22/506599017/despite-pledges-to-cut-back-farms-are-still-using-antibiotics&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been extensive use of antibiotics in animal husbandry. In the United States, the question of emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains due to [[Antibiotic use in livestock|use of antibiotics in livestock]] was raised by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1977. In March 2012, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, ruling in an action brought by the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] and others, ordered the FDA to revoke approvals for the use of antibiotics in livestock, which violated FDA regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=FDA Told to Move on Antibiotic Use in Livestock |url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/FDAGeneral/31792 |accessdate=24 March 2012 |newspaper=MedPage Today|date=23 March 2012|author=John Gever}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The term 'antibiosis', meaning &quot;against life&quot;, was introduced by the French bacteriologist [[Jean Paul Vuillemin]] as a descriptive name of the phenomenon exhibited by these early antibacterial drugs.&lt;ref name=&quot;CALDERIN2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Saxena/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Foster W, Raoult A | title = Early descriptions of antibiosis | journal = J R Coll Gen Pract | volume = 24 | issue = 149 | pages = 889–94 | date = December 1974 | pmid = 4618289 | pmc = 2157443 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibiosis was first described in 1877 in bacteria when Louis Pasteur and [[Robert Koch]] observed that an airborne bacillus could inhibit the growth of ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]''.&lt;ref name=Saxena&gt;Sanjai Saxena, Applied Microbiology&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= H |last= Landsberg |title= Prelude to the discovery of penicillin |journal= Isis |volume= 40 |issue= 3 |pages= 225–7 |year= 1949 |doi=10.1086/349043}}&lt;/ref&gt; These drugs were later renamed antibiotics by [[Selman Waksman]], an American microbiologist, in 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;CALDERIN2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Saxena/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman1947&quot;/&gt;

The term ''antibiotic'' was first used in 1942 by [[Selman Waksman]] and his collaborators in journal articles to describe any substance produced by a microorganism that is [[wikt:antagonism|antagonistic]] to the growth of other microorganisms in high dilution.&lt;ref name=Saxena/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman1947&quot;/&gt; This definition excluded substances that kill bacteria but that are not produced by microorganisms (such as [[gastric juices]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]]). It also excluded [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] antibacterial compounds such as the [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]]. In current usage, the term &quot;antibiotic&quot; is applied to any medication that kills bacteria or inhibits their growth, regardless of whether that medication is produced by a microorganism or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Antimicrobial Drugs|last=Scholar E.

[[Phage therapy]] is another method for treating antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Phage therapy infects pathogenic bacteria with their own viruses, [[bacteriophage]]s and their host ranges are extremely specific for certain bacteria, thus they do not disturb the host organism and intestinal microflora unlike antibiotics.&lt;ref name=&quot;:11&quot; /&gt; Bacteriophages, also known simply as phages, infect and can kill bacteria and affect bacterial growth primarily during lytic cycles.&lt;ref name=&quot;:11&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sulakvelidze&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Sulakvelidze, A. |author2=Alavidze, Z. |author3=Morris, Jr J.

However, some disadvantages to use of bacteriophages also exist. Bacteriophages may harbour virulence factors or toxic genes in their genomes and identification of genes with similarity to known virulence factors or toxins by genomic sequencing may be prudent prior to use. In addition, the oral and IV administration of phages for the eradication of bacterial infections poses a much higher safety risk than topical application, and there is the additional concern of uncertain immune responses to these large antigenic cocktails. There are considerable regulatory hurdles that must be cleared for such therapies.&lt;ref name=&quot;:11&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gill|first=Erin E.|last2=Franco|first2=Octavio L.|last3=Hancock|first3=Robert E.

===Development of new antibiotics===
In April 2013, the [[Infectious Disease Society of America]] (IDSA) reported that the weak antibiotic pipeline does not match bacteria's increasing ability to develop resistance. Since 2009, only 2 new antibiotics were approved in the United States. The number of new antibiotics approved for marketing per year declines continuously. The report identified seven antibiotics against the [[Gram-negative bacilli]] (GNB) currently in [[Phases of clinical research#Phase II|phase 2]] or [[Phases of clinical research#Phase III|phase 3]] clinical trials. However, these drugs do not address the entire spectrum of resistance of GNB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Drug pipeline for worst superbugs 'on life support': report |author=Steenhuysen, Julie |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/04/18/us-antibiotics-superbugs-idINBRE93H05520130418?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=health&amp;dlvrit=309303 |agency=Reuters |date=18 April 2013 |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IDSA2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boucher HW, Talbot GH, Benjamin DK, Bradley J, Guidos RJ, Jones RN, Murray BE, Bonomo RA, Gilbert D | title = 10 x '20 Progress—development of new drugs active against gram-negative bacilli: an update from the Infectious Diseases Society of America | journal = Clin.

''Streptomyces'' research is expected to provide new antibiotics, including treatment against [[MRSA]] and infections resistant to commonly used medication. Efforts of [[John Innes Centre]] and universities in the UK, supported by BBSRC, resulted in the creation of spin-out companies, for example Novacta Biosystems, which has designed the type-b [[lantibiotic]]-based compound NVB302 (in phase 1) to treat ''Clostridium difficile'' infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Osbourn |first=Anne |last2=Goss |first2=Rebecca J. |last3=Carter |first3=Guy T. |date=28 March 2014 |title=Discovery and Development of NVB302, a Semisynthetic Antibiotic for Treatment of ''Clostridium difficile'' Infection |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118794623.ch24/summary |journal=Natural Products: Discourse, Diversity, and Design |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |doi=10.1002/9781118794623.ch24 |accessdate=19 January 2015 |pages=455–468}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/research/impact/streptomyces-antibiotics.aspx Investing in world-class bioscience research and training on behalf of the UK public]&lt;/ref&gt;
Possible improvements include clarification of clinical trial regulations by FDA. Furthermore, appropriate economic incentives could persuade pharmaceutical companies to invest in this endeavor.&lt;ref name=IDSA2013/&gt; In the US, the [[Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment]] (ADAPT) Act was introduced with the aim of fast tracking the drug development of antibiotics to combat the growing threat of 'superbugs'. Under this Act, FDA can approve antibiotics and antifungals treating life-threatening infections based on smaller clinical trials. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] will monitor the use of antibiotics and the emerging resistance, and publish the data. The FDA antibiotics labeling process, 'Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Microbial Organisms' or 'breakpoints', will provide accurate data to healthcare professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.house.gov/press-release/green-gingrey-introduce-adapt-act-safeguard-public-health|title=Green, Gingrey Introduce ADAPT Act to Safeguard Public Health|author=Press Release|publisher=US Congress|date=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/lifesciences/HR3742.pdf|title=Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment Act of 2013|publisher=US Congress|date=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Allan Coukell, senior director for health programs at The Pew Charitable Trusts, &quot;By allowing drug developers to rely on smaller datasets, and clarifying FDA's authority to tolerate a higher level of uncertainty for these drugs when making a risk/benefit calculation, ADAPT would make the clinical trials more feasible.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clarke|first1=Toni|title=U.S. Congress urged to pass bill to speed development of antibiotics|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/19/us-usa-congress-antibiotics-idUSKBN0HE25W20140919|agency=Reuters|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
