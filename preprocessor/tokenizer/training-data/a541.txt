[[File:CantorEscalier.svg|thumb|right|250px| The derivative of the [[Cantor function]] on the [[unit interval]] is 0 for almost all numbers in the unit interval.]]

In [[mathematics]], the phrase &quot;'''almost all'''&quot; has a number of specialised uses which extend its intuitive meaning.

==Cardinality==

Referring to a subset of an infinite set, &quot;almost all&quot; is sometimes used synonymously with &quot;all but [except] [[finite set|finite]]ly many&quot; (that is, it is a [[cofinite]] subset). A simple example is that almost all prime numbers are odd, which is based on the fact that all but one prime number are odd. (The exception is the number 2, which is prime but not odd.)

Referring to a subset of an uncountable set, &quot;almost all&quot; is sometimes used to mean all the elements except for a [[countable set]]&quot; (that is, it is a [[cocountable]] subset).

==Measure theory==
When speaking about the [[real number|reals]], sometimes it means &quot;all reals but a set of [[Lebesgue measure]] zero&quot; (formally, [[almost everywhere]]). In this sense almost all reals are not a member of the [[Cantor set]] even though the Cantor set is [[Uncountable set|uncountable]].

More generally, &quot;almost all&quot; is sometimes used in the sense of &quot;[[almost everywhere]]&quot; in [[measure theory]], or in the closely related sense of &quot;[[almost surely]]&quot; in [[probability theory]].

==Number theory==
In [[number theory]], if ''P''(''n'') is a property of [[positive integers]], and if ''p''(''N'') denotes the number of positive integers ''n'' less than ''N'' for which ''P''(''n'') holds, and if

:''p''(''N'')/''N'' → 1 as ''N'' → ∞

(see [[Limit of a sequence|limit]]), then we say that &quot;''P''(''n'') holds for almost all positive integers ''n''&quot; (formally, [[asymptotically almost surely]]).

For example, the [[prime number theorem]] states that the number of [[prime numbers]] less than or equal to ''N'' is asymptotically equal to ''N''/ln ''N''. Therefore, the proportion of prime integers is roughly 1/ln ''N'', which tends to 0. Thus, ''almost all'' positive integers are [[composite number|composite]] (not prime), however there are still an infinite number of primes.
