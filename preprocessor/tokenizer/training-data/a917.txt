==Early and personal life==
{{see also|Bachchan family}}
Bachchan was born in [[Allahabad]], Uttar Pradesh, in north central India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Masih |first=Archana |date=9 October 2012 |title=Take a tour of Amitabh's home in Allahabad |url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-take-a-tour-of-amitabhs-home-in-allahabad/20121009.htm |newspaper=[[rediff.com]] |location= |publisher= |accessdate=14 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His ancestors on his father's side hailed from a village called [[Babupatti]], in the Raniganj tehsil, in the [[Pratapgarh district, Uttar Pradesh|Pratapgarh district]], in the present-day state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jaya inaugurates library in memory of Harivansh Rai Bachchan |website= OneIndia.com |publisher=Greynium Information Technologies Pvt.

In English, ''Inquilab Zindabad'' means &quot;Long live the revolution.&quot; However, at the suggestion of fellow poet [[Sumitranandan Pant]], Harivansh Rai changed the boy's name to Amitabh, which, according to a Times of India article, means &quot;the light that will never die.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/did-you-know-/Amitabh-was-initially-named-Inquilaab/articleshow/15889267.cms|title=Amitabh was initially named Inquilaab|work=The Times of India|date=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Times of India is incorrect: अमिताभ (cf. the name of the Buddha [[Amitābha]]) means &quot;(one) whose light is infinite (literally: immeasurable)&quot; while &quot;(one) whose light will never die (i.e. is immortal)&quot; would be: अमृताभ; &quot;immeasurable light&quot; and &quot;immortal light&quot; would be अमिताभा and अमृताभा respectively which could not be used as male names since they are feminine compound nouns.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although his surname was [[Srivastava|Shrivastava]], Amitabh's father had adopted the pen name Bachchan (&quot;child-like&quot; in colloquial Hindi), under which he published all of his works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/I-am-proud-of-my-surname-Amitabh-Bachchan/articleshow/9393354.cms|date=28 July 2011|accessdate=26 July 2017|title=I am proud of my surname Amitabh Bachchan}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is with this last name that Amitabh debuted in films and for all other practical purposes, Bachchan has become the surname for all of his immediate family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=In The Afternoon Time|last=Bachchan|first=Harivansh Rai|publisher=Viking Pr|year=1998|isbn=978-0670881581|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachchan's father died in 2003, and his mother in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teji Bachchan passes away |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=2078579f-853d-48ae-b826-eeee479169e2&amp;ParentID=d5c75cbf-62a5-49eb-a016-0cf71383854b&amp;&amp;Headline=Big+B's+mother+Teji+Bachchan+is+no+more |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225061509/http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=2078579f-853d-48ae-b826-eeee479169e2&amp;ParentID=d5c75cbf-62a5-49eb-a016-0cf71383854b&amp;&amp;Headline=Big+B%27s+mother+Teji+Bachchan+is+no+more |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 December 2007 |work=[[Hindustan Times]] |author=Khan, Alifiya |accessdate=10 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bachchan is an alumnus of [[Sherwood College]], [[Nainital]].

His mother had a keen interest in theatre and was offered a feature film role, but she preferred her domestic duties.

==Career==

===Early work: 1969–1972===
Bachchan made his film debut in 1969 as a voice narrator in [[Mrinal Sen]]'s [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film|National Award]] winning film ''[[Bhuvan Shome]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author =Suresh Kohli |url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/cinema/article3428922.ece |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130205112700/http://www.thehindu.com/arts/cinema/article3428922.ece |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 February 2013 |title=Arts / Cinema: Bhuvan Shome (1969) |work=The Hindu |date=17 May 2012 |accessdate=11 December 2012 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first acting role was as one of the seven protagonists in the film ''[[Saat Hindustani]]'' directed by [[Khwaja Ahmad Abbas]] and featuring [[Utpal Dutt]], [[Anwar Ali (actor)|Anwar Ali]] (brother of comedian [[Mehmood (actor)|Mehmood]]), [[Madhu (actor)|Madhu]] and [[Jalal Agha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author =Avijit Ghosh |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-11-07/india/28085479_1_amitabh-bachchan-saat-hindustani-malayalam-actor |title=Big B's debut film hit the screens 40 yrs ago, today |work=The Times of India |accessdate=11 December 2012 |date=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;First national award&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.rediff.com/movies/2007/aug/09amitabh.htm |title='I felt I did a good job in Black' |publisher=Rediff.com |date=9 August 2007 |accessdate=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Anand (1971 film)|Anand]]'' (1971) followed, in which Bachchan starred alongside Rajesh Khanna. His role as a doctor with a cynical view of life garnered Bachchan his first Filmfare ''[[List of awards for supporting actor|Best Supporting Actor]]'' award. He then played his first antagonist role as an infatuated lover-turned-murderer in ''[[Parwana (1971 film)|Parwana]]'' (1971). Following Parwana were several films including ''[[Reshma Aur Shera]]'' (1971). During this time, he made a guest appearance in the film ''[[Guddi (1971 film)|Guddi]]'' which starred his future wife Jaya Bhaduri. He narrated part of the film ''[[Bawarchi]].'' In 1972 he made an appearance in the road action comedy ''[[Bombay to Goa]]'' directed by [[S. Ramanathan]]. Many of Bachchan's films during this early period did not do well, but that was about to change.&lt;ref name=iconic1&gt;{{cite web|title=80 iconic performances 1/10 |url=http://www.filmfare.com/details.php?id=950 |date=1 June 2010 |accessdate=29 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118035457/http://www.filmfare.com/details.php?id=950 |archivedate=18 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise to stardom: 1973–1983===
[[File:BigB N JayaB.jpg|right|thumb|225px|Bachchan and wife [[Jaya Bhaduri|Jaya Bhaduri Bachchan]] in 2013, the couple got married in 1973, after the release of ''Zanjeer''.]]
Director [[Prakash Mehra]] cast him in the leading role for the film ''Zanjeer'' (1973) as Inspector Vijay Khanna. The film was a sharp contrast to the romantically themed films that had generally preceded it and established Amitabh in a new persona—the &quot;angry young man&quot; of Bollywood cinema.&lt;ref name=angryyoungman/&gt; Filmfare considers this one of the most iconic performances of Bollywood history.&lt;ref name=iconic1/&gt; The film was a huge success and one of the highest-grossing films of that year, breaking Bachchan's dry spell at the box office and making him a star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=179&amp;catName=MTk3Mw== |title=Box Office 1973 |publisher=Boxofficeindia.com |accessdate=12 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020131818/http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=179&amp;catName=MTk3Mw%3D%3D |archivedate=20 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From then onwards, Bachchan became one of the most successful leading men of the film industry. He earned his first Filmfare nomination for Best Actor for ''Zanjeer''. The year 1973 was also when he married Jaya, and around this time they appeared in several films together; not only in ''Zanjeer'' but in films such as ''[[Abhimaan (1973 film)|Abhimaan]]'' which followed and was released only a month after their marriage and was also successful at the box office. Later, Bachchan played the role of Vikram, once again along with Rajesh Khanna, in the film ''[[Namak Haraam]]'', a social drama directed by [[Hrishikesh Mukherjee]] and scripted by Biresh Chatterjee addressing themes of friendship. His supporting role won him his second Filmfare ''[[List of awards for supporting actor|Best Supporting Actor]]'' award.

In 1974, Bachchan made several guest appearances in films such as ''[[Kunwara Baap (1974 film)|Kunwara Baap]]'' and ''[[Dost (1974 film)|Dost]]'', before playing a supporting role in ''[[Roti Kapda Aur Makaan]]''. The film, directed and written by [[Manoj Kumar]], addressed themes of honesty in the face of oppression and financial and emotional hardship and was the top earning film of 1974. Bachchan then played the leading role in the film ''[[Majboor (1974 film)|Majboor]]'', released on 6 December 1974, which was a remake of the Hollywood film ''[[Zig Zag (1970 film)|Zig Zag]]''. The film was a success at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=180&amp;catName=MTk3NA== Box Office India].  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020121213/http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=180&amp;catName=MTk3NA%3D%3D |date=20 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, he starred in a variety of film genres from the comedy ''[[Chupke Chupke]],'' the crime drama ''[[Faraar]]'' to the romantic drama ''[[Mili (1975 film)|Mili]].'' 1975 was also the year when Bachchan appeared in two films regarded as important in Hindi cinema history. He starred in the [[Yash Chopra]] directed film ''Deewaar'' along with [[Shashi Kapoor]], [[Nirupa Roy]], and [[Neetu Singh]], earning him a Filmfare nomination for Best Actor. The film became a major hit at the box office in 1975, ranking in at number 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=181&amp;catName=MTk3NQ== |title=Box Office 1975 |work=BoxOffice India.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020122136/http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=181&amp;catName=MTk3NQ%3D%3D |archivedate=20 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Indiatimes Movies'' ranks ''Deewaar'' amongst the ''Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films''.&lt;ref name=&quot;mustsee&quot;/&gt; Released on 15 August 1975 was ''[[Sholay]]'', which became the highest-grossing film of 1975 and also of all time in India, earning [[Indian rupee|INR]] {{formatnum:2364500000}} equivalent to US$60 million, after adjusting for inflation,&lt;ref name=boxoffice&gt;{{cite web|title=Sholay |url=http://www.ibosnetwork.com/asp/filmbodetails.asp?id=Sholay |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120630155123/http://www.ibosnetwork.com/asp/filmbodetails.asp?id=Sholay |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 June 2012 |publisher=International Business Overview Standard |accessdate=6 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Bachchan played the role of Jaidev.

In 1976, he was cast by Yash Chopra in the romantic family drama ''[[Kabhie Kabhie (1976 film)|Kabhie Kabhie]]''. Bachchan starred as a young poet named Amit Malhotra who falls deeply in love with a beautiful young girl named Pooja ([[Rakhee Gulzar]]) who ends up marrying someone else ([[Shashi Kapoor]]). The film was notable for portraying Bachchan as a romantic hero, a far cry from his &quot;angry young man&quot; roles like ''Zanjeer'' and ''Deewar''. The film evoked a favourable response from critics and audiences alike. Bachchan was again nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award for his role in the film. That same year he played a double role in ''[[Adalat (1976 film)|Adalat]]'' as father and son. In 1977, he won his first [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor|Filmfare Best Actor Award]] for his performance in ''Amar Akbar Anthony'' where he played the third lead opposite [[Vinod Khanna]] and [[Rishi Kapoor]] as Anthony Gonsalves. The film was the highest-grossing film of that year. His other successes that year include ''[[Parvarish (1977 film)|Parvarish]]'' and ''[[Khoon Pasina]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=183&amp;catName=MTk3Nw== |title=Box Office 1977 |publisher=Boxofficeindia.com |accessdate=11 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012163829/http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=183&amp;catName=MTk3Nw%3D%3D |archivedate=12 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He once again resumed double roles in films such as ''[[Kasme Vaade]]'' (1978) as Amit and Shankar and ''[[Don (1978 film)|Don]]'' (1978) playing the characters of Don, a leader of an underworld gang and his look-alike Vijay. His performance won him his second Filmfare Best Actor Award. He also gave towering performances in Yash Chopra's ''[[Trishul (film)|Trishul]]'' and Prakash Mehra's ''[[Muqaddar Ka Sikandar]]'' both of which earned him further Filmfare Best Actor nominations. 1978 is widely regarded as perhaps his most successful year at the box office since all of his six releases the same year, namely Muqaddar Ka Sikandar, Trishul, Don, Kasme Vaade, ''[[Ganga Ki Saugandh]]'' and ''[[Besharam]]'' were massive successes, the former three being the consecutive highest-grossing films of the year, remarkably releasing within a couple of months of each other, a rare feat in Indian cinema.&lt;ref&gt;http://boxofficeindia.co.in/worth-their-weight-in-gold-70s/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

In 1979, Bachchan starred in ''[[Suhaag (1979 film)|Suhaag]]'' which was the highest earning film of that year. In the same year he also enjoyed critical acclaim and commercial success with films like ''[[Mr. Natwarlal]],'' ''[[Kaala Patthar]]'', ''[[The Great Gambler]]'' and ''[[Manzil (1979 film)|Manzil]]''. Amitabh was required to use his singing voice for the first time in a song from the film ''Mr. Natwarlal'' in which he starred with [[Rekha]]. Bachchan's performance in the film saw him nominated for both the Filmfare Best Actor Award and the ''[[Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer]]''. He also received Best Actor nomination for ''Kaala Patthar'' and then went on to be nominated again in 1980 for the [[Raj Khosla]] directed film ''[[Dostana (1980 film)|Dostana]]'', in which he starred opposite [[Shatrughan Sinha]] and [[Zeenat Aman]]. ''Dostana'' proved to be the top-grossing film of 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=186&amp;catName=MTk4MA== |title=BoxOffice India.com |publisher=BoxOffice India.com |accessdate=15 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102005754/http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=186&amp;catName=MTk4MA%3D%3D |archivedate=2 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, he starred in Yash Chopra's melodrama film ''[[Silsila (film)|Silsila]]'', where he starred alongside his wife Jaya and also Rekha. Other films of this period like ''[[Shaan (film)|Shaan]]'' (1980) and ''[[Shakti (1982 film)|Shakti]]'' (1982) which pitted him against the veteran actor [[Dilip Kumar]] were not successful at the box office but ''[[Ram Balram]]'' (1980), ''[[Naseeb (1981 film)|Naseeb]]'' (1981) and ''[[Laawaris (film)|Lawaaris]]'' (1981) were successful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Box office success&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Box Office India |title=Bachchan's box office success |url=http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=187&amp;catName=MTk4MQ== |accessdate=27 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005055546/http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=187&amp;catName=MTk4MQ%3D%3D |archivedate=5 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 he played double roles in the films ''[[Satte Pe Satta]]'' and ''[[Desh Premee]]'' which succeeded at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=187&amp;catName=MTk4MQ== |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928072451/http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=187&amp;catName=MTk4MQ%3D%3D |title=Boxofficeindia.com |archivedate=28 September 2013 |work=boxofficeindia.com |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 he played a triple role in ''[[Mahaan]]'' and starred in the top-grossing film of that year ''[[Coolie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=189&amp;catName=MTk4Mw== |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928072533/http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=189&amp;catName=MTk4Mw%3D%3D |title=Boxofficeindia.com |archivedate=28 September 2013 |work=boxofficeindia.com |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1982 injury while filming ''Coolie''===
On 26 July 1982, while filming ''[[Coolie (1983 Hindi film)|Coolie]]'', in the University Campus in Bangalore, Bachchan suffered a near fatal intestinal injury during the filming of a fight scene with co-actor [[Puneet Issar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Coolie fight scene&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Rediff.com |title=Bachchan injured whilst shooting scene |url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2001/oct/11amit.htm |accessdate=11 March 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070304103635/http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2001/oct/11amit.htm| archivedate= 4 March 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachchan was performing his own stunts in the film and one scene required him to fall onto a table and then on the ground. However, as he jumped towards the table, the corner of the table struck his abdomen, resulting in a [[Splenic injury|splenic rupture]] from which he lost a significant amount of blood. He required an emergency [[splenectomy]] and remained critically ill in hospital for many months, at times close to death. The public response included prayers in temples and offers to sacrifice limbs to save him, while later, there were long queues of well-wishing fans outside the hospital where he was recuperating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/Entertainment/Amitabh-Bachchan-no-longer-excited-about-birthdays/Article1-463669.aspx |title=Amitabh Bachchan no longer excited about birthdays |work=Hindustan Times |date=10 October 2009 |accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, he resumed filming later that year after a long period of recuperation. The film was released in 1983, and partly due to the huge publicity of Bachchan's accident, the film was a box office success and the top-grossing film of that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coolie&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Box Office India |title=Coolie a success |url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=125&amp;catName=MTk4MC0xOTg5 |accessdate=11 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112040659/http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=125 |archivedate=12 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The director, [[Manmohan Desai]], altered the ending of ''Coolie'' after Bachchan's accident. Bachchan's character was originally intended to have been killed off but after the change of script, the character lived in the end. It would have been inappropriate, said Desai, for the man who had just fended off death in real life to be killed on screen. Also, in the released film the footage of the fight scene is frozen at the critical moment, and a caption appears onscreen marking this as the instant of the actor's injury and the ensuing publicity of the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.ndtv.com/movie_story.aspx?Section=Movies&amp;ID=250266&amp;subcatg=&amp;keyword=Bollywood&amp;nid=250266 |title=30 years after the Coolie accident: Big B's &quot;second birthday&quot; |publisher=Movies.ndtv.com |date=2 August 2012 |accessdate=11 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130129170555/http://movies.ndtv.com/movie_story.aspx?Section=Movies&amp;ID=250266&amp;subcatg=&amp;keyword=Bollywood&amp;nid=250266 |archivedate=29 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, he was diagnosed with [[Myasthenia gravis]]. His illness made him feel weak both mentally and physically and he decided to quit films and venture into politics. At this time he became pessimistic, expressing concern with how a new film would be received and stated before every release, &quot;Yeh film to flop hogi!&quot; (&quot;This film will flop&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Myasthenia Gravis&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=mouthshut.com|title=Reviews on: To Be or Not To Be Amitabh Bachchan |author =Mohamed, Khalid|url=http://www.mouthshut.com/review/To_Be_or_Not_To_Be_Amitabh_Bachchan_-_Khalid_Mohamed-72513-1.html |accessdate=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics: 1984–87===
In 1984, Bachchan took a break from acting and briefly entered politics in support of long-time family friend, [[Rajiv Gandhi]]. He contested Allahabad's seat of [[8th Lok Sabha]] against [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna|H. N. Bahuguna]], former [[List of Chief Ministers of Uttar Pradesh|Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh]] and won by one of the highest victory margins in [[General elections in India|general election history]] (68.2% of the vote).&lt;ref name=election&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/specials/amitabh/politics.htm |title=Amitabh Bachchan: Stint in Politics |work=Hindustan Times |accessdate=5 December 2005| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060109123607/http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/specials/amitabh/politics.htm| archivedate= 9 January 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His political career, however, was short-lived: he resigned after three years, calling politics a [[Cesspit|cesspool]]. The resignation followed the implication of Bachchan and his brother in the &quot;[[Bofors scandal]]&quot; by a newspaper, which he vowed to take to court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sathnam.com/Features/17/interview-with-amitabh-bachchan |title=Interview with Amitabh Bachchan |publisher=sathnam.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ppKBfYB7?url=http://www.sathnam.com/Features/17/interview-with-amitabh-bachchan |archivedate=18 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachchan was eventually found not guilty of involvement in the ordeal.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=November 2016}}

His old friend, [[Amar Singh (politician)|Amar Singh]], helped him during the financial crisis caused by the failure of his company, [[Amitabh Bachchan Corporation|ABCL]]. Thereafter Bachchan started supporting the [[Samajwadi Party]], the political party to which Amar Singh belonged. Furthermore, Jaya Bachchan joined the Samajwadi party and represented the party as an MP in the  [[Rajya Sabha]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/02/18/stories/2007021804271000.htm &quot;Bachchan has no plans for election.&quot;] ''The Hindu''.&lt;/ref&gt; Bachchan has continued to do favours for the Samajwadi party, including appearing in advertisements and political campaigns. These activities have recently got him into trouble in the Indian courts for false claims after a previous incident of submission of legal papers by him, stating that he is a farmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iJuYOasTF-bsTo0AQjW96aD2Kr2w |title=Bollywood's Bachchan in trouble over crime claim |agency=Agence France-Presse |date=4 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5bPT62ngo?url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iJuYOasTF-bsTo0AQjW96aD2Kr2w |archivedate=8 October 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 15-year press ban against Bachchan was imposed during his peak acting years by ''[[Stardust (magazine)|Stardust]]'' and some of the other film magazines. In defence, Bachchan claimed to have banned the press from entering his sets until late 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldbh.bollywoodhungama.com/features/2007/01/27/2173/index.html |title=The 15-year ban on Bachchan! |publisher=Oldbh.bollywoodhungama.com |date=27 January 2007 |accessdate=24 March 2012 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comeback and retirement: 1988–1992===
[[File:Amitabhbachchan28529.jpg|right|thumb|225px|Bachchan during the shoot of 1990 Hindi film ''[[Agneepath (1990 film)|Agneepath]].]]
In 1988, Bachchan returned to films, playing the title role in ''[[Shahenshah (film)|Shahenshah]]'', which was a box office success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/cpages.php?pageName=top_actors&amp;PHPSESSID=cfa06e3b5a051913d58987e99cd292ae |work=boxofficeindia.com/topactors.htm |title=Top Actor |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191201/http://boxofficeindia.com/cpages.php?pageName=top_actors |archivedate=29 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of his comeback film however, his star power began to wane as all of his subsequent films like ''[[Jaadugar]]'', ''[[Toofan (1989 film)|Toofan]]'' and ''[[Main Azaad Hoon]]'' (all released in 1989) failed at the box office. The 1991 hit film, ''[[Hum (film)|Hum]]'', for which he won his third Filmfare Best Actor Award, looked like it might reverse the trend, but this momentum was short-lived and his string of box office failures continued. Notably, despite the lack of hits, it was during this era that Bachchan won his first [[National Film Award for Best Actor]] for his performance as a Mafia don in the 1990 film ''[[Agneepath (1990 film)|Agneepath]].'' These years would see his last on-screen appearances for some time. After the release of ''[[Khuda Gawah]]'' in 1992, Bachchan went into semi-retirement for five years. With the exception of the delayed release of ''[[Insaniyat (1994 film)|Insaniyat]]'' (1994), which was also a box office failure, Bachchan did not appear in any new releases for five years.&lt;ref name=&quot;boxoffice1994&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=200&amp;catName=MTk5NA== |publisher=Box Office India |title=Box Office 1994 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107074858/http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=200 |archivedate=7 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Producer and acting comeback 1996–99===
Bachchan turned producer during his temporary retirement period, setting up [[Amitabh Bachchan Corporation]], Ltd. (ABCL) in 1996, with a vision of becoming a 10 billion rupees (approx. U.S. $250 M) premier entertainment company by the year 2000.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} ABCL's strategy was to introduce products and services covering an entire cross-section of India's entertainment industry. ABCL's operations were mainstream commercial film production and distribution, audio cassettes and video discs, production and marketing of television software, and celebrity and event management.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Soon after the company was launched in 1996, the first film it produced was ''[[Tere Mere Sapne (1996 film)|Tere Mere Sapne]],'' which did not fare well at the box office but launched the careers of actors like  [[Arshad Warsi]] and southern film star [[Simran (actress)|Simran]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} ABCL produced a few other films, none of which did well.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In 1997, Bachchan attempted to make his acting comeback with the film ''[[Mrityudata]]'', produced by ABCL. Though ''Mrityudaata'' attempted to reprise Bachchan's earlier success as an action hero, the film was a failure both financially and critically.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} ABCL was the main sponsor of the ''[[Miss World 1996|1996 Miss World beauty pageant]]'', [[Bangalore]], but lost millions. The fiasco and the consequent legal battles surrounding ABCL and various entities after the event, coupled with the fact that ABCL was reported to have overpaid most of its top level managers, eventually led to its financial and operational collapse in 1997. The company went into administration and was later declared a failed company by the Indian Industries board.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The Bombay high court, in April 1999, restrained Bachchan from selling off his Bombay [[bungalow]] 'Prateeksha' and two flats till the pending loan recovery cases of [[Canara Bank]] were disposed of. Bachchan had, however, pleaded that he had mortgaged his bungalow to raise funds for his company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20010304/spectrum/main1.htm |title=Muqaddar Ka Sikandar |author =Patil, Vimla |date=4 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bachchan attempted to revive his acting career and had average success with ''[[Bade Miyan Chote Miyan]]'' (1998),&lt;ref name=&quot;boxoffice1994&quot;/&gt; and received positive reviews for ''[[Sooryavansham]]'' (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.rediff.com/movies/1999/may/22soo.htm |author =Taliculam, Sharmila |title=He's back!}}&lt;/ref&gt; but other films such as ''[[Lal Baadshah]]'' (1999) and ''[[Hindustan Ki Kasam (1999 film)|Hindustan Ki Kasam]]'' (1999) were box office failures.

===Return to prominence: 2000–present===
[[File:Amitabh Bachchan.jpg|thumb|Bachchan at the [[IIFA Awards]] in 2006]]
[[File:Bachan mohanlal.jpg|thumb|right|Bachchan with [[Mohanlal]]]]
In 2000, Amitabh Bachchan appeared in Yash Chopra's box-office hit, ''[[Mohabbatein]]'', directed by [[Aditya Chopra]]. He played a stern, older figure that rivalled the character of [[Shah Rukh Khan|Shahrukh Khan]]. His role won him his third [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor|Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award]]. Other hits followed, with Bachchan appearing as an older family patriarch in ''[[Ek Rishtaa: The Bond of Love]]'' (2001), ''[[Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...]]'' (2001) and ''[[Baghban (film)|Baghban]]'' (2003). As an actor, he continued to perform in a range of characters, receiving critical praise for his performances in ''[[Aks (film)|Aks]]'' (2001), ''[[Aankhen (2002 film)|Aankhen]]'' (2002), ''[[Khakee]]'' (2004) and ''[[Dev (film)|Dev]]'' (2004).
His performance in ''Aks'' won him his first [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor]].
One project that did particularly well for Bachchan was [[Sanjay Leela Bhansali]]'s ''[[Black (2005 film)|Black]]'' (2005). The film starred Bachchan as an aging teacher of a deaf-blind girl and followed their relationship. His performance was unanimously praised by critics and audiences and won him his second National Film Award for Best Actor, his fourth Filmfare Best Actor Award and his second Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor. Taking advantage of this resurgence, Amitabh began endorsing a variety of products and services, appearing in many television and billboard advertisements. In 2005 and 2006, he starred with his son Abhishek in the hit films ''[[Bunty Aur Babli]]'' (2005), the ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]'' tribute ''[[Sarkar (film)|Sarkar]]'' (2005), and ''[[Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna]]'' (2006).
