'''Afonso II''' ({{IPA-pt|ɐˈfõsu}}; English: ''Alphonzo''), or ''Affonso'' (Archaic Portuguese), ''Alfonso'' or ''Alphonso'' ([[Portuguese-Galician languages|Portuguese-Galician]]) or ''Alphonsus'' ([[Latin]] version), nicknamed &quot;the Fat&quot; ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''o Gordo''), [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King of Portugal]], was born in [[Coimbra]] on 23 April 1185{{Sfn|Caetano de Souza|1735|p=131}} and died on 25 March 1223 in the same city. He was the second but eldest surviving son of [[Sancho I of Portugal]] by his wife, [[Dulce of Aragon|Dulce]], ''[[Infante|Infanta]]'' of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]]. Afonso succeeded his father on 27 March 1211.{{Sfn|Caetano de Souza|1735|p=132}}{{Sfn|Carvalho Correia|2008|p=187}}

==Reign==
[[File:D. Afonso II - Pedro Perret 1603.png|thumb|left|A 17th century depiction of Afonso.]]
As a king, Afonso II set a different approach of government. Hitherto, his father Sancho I and his grandfather [[Afonso I of Portugal|Afonso I]] were mostly concerned with military issues either against the neighbouring [[Kingdom of Castile]] or against the [[Moors|Moorish]] lands in the south. Afonso did not pursue territory enlargement policies and managed to insure peace with Castile during his reign. Despite this, some towns, like [[Alcácer do Sal]] in 1217, were conquered from the Moors by the private initiative of noblemen. This does not mean that he was a weak or somehow cowardly man. The first years of his reign were marked instead by internal disturbances between Afonso and his brothers and sisters. The king managed to keep security within Portuguese borders only by outlawing and exiling his kin.

Since military issues were not a government priority, Afonso established the state's administration and centralized power on himself. He designed the first set of Portuguese written laws. These were mainly concerned with [[private property]], civil justice, and [[Mint (coin)|minting]]. Afonso also sent ambassadors to European kingdoms outside the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and began amicable commercial relations with most of them.

Other reforms included the always delicate matters with the pope. In order to get the independence of Portugal recognized by Rome, his grandfather, Afonso I, had to legislate an enormous number of privileges to the Church. These eventually created a state within the state. With Portugal's position as a country firmly established, Afonso II endeavoured to weaken the power of the clergy and to apply a portion of the enormous revenues of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] to purposes of national utility. These actions led to a serious diplomatic conflict between the pope and Portugal. After being [[excommunicated]] for his audacities by [[Pope Honorius III]], Afonso II promised to make amends to the church, but he died in Coimbra on 25 March 1223{{Sfn|Caetano de Souza|1735|p=134}} before making any serious attempts to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Alphonso|display=Alphonso s.v. Alphonso II.|first=David|last=Hannay|authorlink=David Hannay (historian)|volume=1|page=733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King Afonso was buried originally at the [[Monastery of Santa Cruz (Coimbra)|Monastery of Santa Cruz]] in Coimbra where his body remained for nearly ten years. His remains were transferred subsequently to [[Alcobaça Monastery]],{{Sfn|Caetano de Souza|1735|pp=134–135}} as he had stipulated in his will. He and his wife, Queen Urraca, were buried at its Royal Pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601000000*/http://www.mosteiroalcobaca.pt/pt/index.php?s=white&amp;pid=232&amp;identificador=at321_pt.doc|title=D.
