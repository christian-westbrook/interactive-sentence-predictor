Ashmore Reef is called ''Pulau Pasir'' by Indonesians and it is called ''Nusa Solokaek'' in the [[Rotenese language]].

==Geography==
The Territory comprises Ashmore Reef, which includes West, Middle, and [[East Island (Ashmore and Cartier Islands)|East Islands]], and two [[lagoon]]s, and Cartier Reef, which includes [[Cartier Islands|Cartier Island]]. Ashmore Reef covers approximately {{convert|150|km2|1|abbr=on}} and Cartier Reef {{convert|9|km2|0|abbr=on}}, both to the limits of the reefs.&lt;ref name=YrBk1981/&gt;{{citation needed | reason=An Australian Government page cited suggests Ashmore Reef is 239 sq km. | date=April 2014}} They have a total of {{convert|74.1|km|0|abbr=on}} of shoreline, measured along the outer edge of the [[reef]].{{clarify|reason=Which reef? Citation? CIA World Fact Book uses that figure, but does not say how measured.|date=April 2014}} Australia also claims a 12 nautical mile [[Territorial waters|territorial sea]] generated by the islands.&lt;ref name=DIRD/&gt;

West, Middle, and East Islands have a combined land area variously reported as 54 ha, 93 ha, and 112 ha (1 [[hectare]] is 0.01&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or about 2.5 [[acres]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carter|first1=Mike|last2=Clarke|first2=Rohan|last3=Pierce|first3=Frank|last4=Dooley|first4=Sean|last5=Swann|first5=George|last6=Grant|first6=Murray|title=Lesser Coucal 'Centropus bengalensis' on Ashmore Reef: First Record for Australia|issn=1448-0107|work=Australian Field Ornithology|volume=27|issue=3|year=2010|quote=Within the reef are three small islands: West, Middle and east Islands (total land area 54 ha).

==History==
By a British [[Order-in-council]] dated 23 July 1931, Ashmore and Cartier Islands were placed under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia, but Australia officially accepted the Territory on 10 May 1934 when the ''Ashmore and Cartier Islands Acceptance Act 1933'' came into operation. The Act authorised the [[Governor of Western Australia]] to make Ordinances for the Territory. In July 1938 the Territory was annexed to the Northern Territory, then also administered by the Commonwealth, whose laws, ordinances and regulations applied to the Territory. When [[self-government]] was granted to the Northern Territory on 1 July 1978, administration of the Territory was retained by the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name=DIRD/&gt;&lt;ref name=YrBk1981&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=MVc4-noHRpIC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=Authorities+close+off+Cartier+Island&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GAWhQNcmeV&amp;sig=Hjw9iTjJA0CN1RASyjxCV9uiGys&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiXoKH338LNAhXGoJQKHSv5BjYQ6AEIVjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Authorities%20close%20off%20Cartier%20Island&amp;f=false Year Book Australia, 1981, p.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its proximity to Indonesia, and the area being traditional fishing grounds of Indonesian fishermen for centuries, some Indonesian groups claim Ashmore Reef to be part of [[Rote Ndao Regency]] of [[East Nusa Tenggara]] province. However, the Indonesian government does not appear to actively contest Australia's sovereignty of the Territory. Australia's sovereignty is backed up by the fact that the Territory was not administered by the [[Netherlands]] (Indonesia's former colonial power), but by the [[United Kingdom|British]] before it was transferred to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agriculture.gov.au/fisheries/international/cooperation/indonesia Indonesia - Australia Fisheries Cooperation]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 the Territory was declared a nature reserve under the ''National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975'',&lt;ref name=DIRD/&gt; now replaced by the ''[[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/epabca1999588/ Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]''&lt;/ref&gt;

After the islands became a first point of contact with the [[Australian migration zone]], in September 2001, the Australian government excised the Ashmore and Cartier Islands from the Australian migration zone.&lt;ref name=DIRD/&gt;

==Governance==
Today, the Territory is administered from [[Canberra]] by the [[Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development]], which is also responsible for the administration of the territories of [[Christmas Island]], [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]], the [[Coral Sea Islands]], [[Jervis Bay Territory]] and [[Norfolk Island]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AussieAG&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author =  Assistant Director, Territories and Disaster Reconstruction Division | title = Territories of Australia | url = http://www.regional.gov.au/territories | publisher= Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport | date= 16 June 2012 | accessdate = 7 February 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110211125655/http://www.regional.gov.au/territories/| archivedate=11 February 2011&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Attorney-General's Department (Australia)|Attorney-General's Department]] had been responsible for the administration of Australian territories until the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]]. In that year the responsibility for Australian territories was transferred to the then [[Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport]],&lt;ref name=DIRD/&gt; and from 18 September 2013 the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development has administered Australian territories.

Defence of Ashmore and Cartier Islands is the responsibility of Australia, with periodic visits by the [[Royal Australian Navy]], [[Royal Australian Air Force]] and [[Australian Customs and Border Protection Service]].

Nearby Hibernia Reef, {{convert|42|km|0|abbr=on}} northeast of Ashmore Reef, is not part of the Territory, but belongs to [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statoids.com/uau.html States of Australia] Retrieved 2011-06-23&lt;/ref&gt; It has no permanently dry land area, although large parts of the reef become exposed during low tide.

===Ashmore Reef Commonwealth Marine Reserve===
[[File:Cartier Island.png|thumb|right|Cartier Island and surrounding reef ([[NASA]] satellite image)]]
The Ashmore Reef Commonwealth Marine Reserve (formerly Ashmore Reef National Nature Reserve), established in August 1983,&lt;ref name=DEnv&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/topics/marine/marine-reserves/north-west/ashmore Ashmore Reef Commonwealth Marine Reserve]&lt;/ref&gt; comprises an area of approximately {{convert|583|km2|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://laptop.deh.gov.au/marinereserves/north-west/ashmore/index.html | accessdate=2014-04-14 | date=2013-06-17 | work=Commonwealth Marine Reserves | publisher=Department of the Environment, Australian Government | title=Ashmore Reef Commonwealth Marine Reserve }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is of significant [[biodiversity]] value as it is in the flow of the [[Indonesian Throughflow]] ocean current from the Pacific Ocean through [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] to the Indian Ocean.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} It is also in a surface current west from the [[Arafura Sea]] and [[Timor Sea]].

The Reserve comprises several marine habitats, including seagrass meadows, intertidal sand flats, coral reef flats, and lagoons, and supports an important and diverse range of species, including 14 species of [[sea snake]]s, a population of [[dugong]] that may be genetically distinct, a diverse [[marine invertebrate]] fauna, and many [[endemism|endemic]] species, especially of sea snakes and [[mollusc]]s. There are feeding and nesting sites for [[Loggerhead Turtle|loggerhead]], [[Hawksbill turtle|hawksbill]] and [[green turtle]]s.  It is classified as an [[Important Bird Area]]  and has 50,000 breeding pairs of various kinds of [[seabird]]s.  A high abundance and diversity of [[sea cucumber]]s, [[over-exploitation|over-exploited]] on other reefs in the region, is present, with 45 species recorded.&lt;ref name=ARL/&gt;

In 2003 the nature reserve was recognised as a wetland of international importance due to the importance of its islands providing a resting place for migratory shorebirds and supporting large seabird breeding colonies.&lt;ref name=DEnv/&gt; It was designated Ramsar Site 1220 under the [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar Convention on Wetlands]].&lt;ref name=ARL&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-pubs-annolist-annotated-ramsar-16713/main/ramsar/1-30-168%5E16713_4000_0__ |title= The Annotated Ramsar List: Australia |accessdate= 10 April 2010 |work= |publisher= The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands |date= 4 January 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cartier Island Commonwealth Marine Reserve===
The Cartier Island Commonwealth Marine Reserve (formerly Cartier Island Marine Reserve) was established in June 2000, and comprises an area of approximately {{convert|172|km2|0|abbr=on}}, within a 4 nautical mile radius from the center of Cartier Island, and extends to a depth of {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on}} below the sea floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://laptop.deh.gov.au/marinereserves/north-west/cartier/index.html | accessdate=2014-04-14 | date=2013-06-17 | work=Commonwealth Marine Reserves | publisher=Department of the Environment, Australian Government | title=Cartier Island Commonwealth Marine Reserve }}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes the reef around Cartier island, a small submerged pinnacle called Wave Governor Bank, and two shallow pools to the island's northeast. The Reserve is part of the North-west Commonwealth Marine Reserve Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=North-west Commonwealth Marine Reserves Network|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/topics/marine/marine-reserves/north-west|publisher=Parks Australia, Department of the Environment|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
There is no economic activity in the Territory, Ashmore and Cartier Islands being uninhabited. Cartier Island is an unvegetated sand island.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa2004&quot;/&gt; Access to Cartier Island is prohibited because of the risk of [[unexploded ordnance]]s. There are no ports or harbours, only offshore anchorage. The customs vessel [[ACV Ashmore Guardian|ACV ''Ashmore Guardian'']] is stationed off the reef for up to 330 days per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;FactSheet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.customs.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/FS_AshmoreGuardian.pdf|title=Australian Customs Vessel ''Ashmore Guardian''|publisher=Australian Customs and Border Protection Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands are also visited by seasonal caretakers and occasional scientific researchers.

The area has been a traditional fishing ground of Indonesian fishermen for centuries, and continues. In the 1850s, American whalers operated in the region. Mining of phosphate deposits took place on Ashmore Island in the latter half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=DIRD/&gt; Today, all the [[water well|well]]s in the Territory are infected with [[cholera]] or contaminated and [[potable water|undrinkable]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defence.gov.au/news/NAVYNEWS/editions/1999/06_28_99/story03.htm Bizarre Happenings at Reef], [[Royal Australian Navy]] News, 28 June 1999, accessed 29 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Petroleum extraction activities take place at the [[Jabiru oil field|Jabiru]] and [[Challis oil field]]s, which are adjacent to the Territory, and which are administered by the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy on behalf of the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name=DIRD/&gt;

==Migration==
As Ashmore Reef is the closest point of Australian territory to Indonesia, it was a popular target for [[people smugglers]] transporting [[asylum seekers]] en route to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Roberts [https://web.archive.org/web/20080830045428/http://www.insideindonesia.org/edit66/anita4.htm &quot;Don't let them drown&quot;] ''Inside Indonesia'' Apr–Jun 2001, vol. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Once they had landed on Ashmore Island, asylum seekers could claim to have entered Australian migration zone and request to be processed as refugees. The use of Ashmore Island for this purpose created great notoriety during late 2001, when refugee arrivals became a major political issue in Australia. The Australian Government argued that as Australia was not the country of first asylum for these &quot;[[boat people]]&quot;, Australia did not have a responsibility to accept them.

A number of things were done to discourage the use of the Territory for this purpose, such as attempting to have the people smugglers arrested in Indonesia; the so-called [[Pacific Solution]] of processing them in third countries; the boarding and forced turnaround of the boats by Australian military forces; and finally excising the Territory and many other small islands from the [[Australian migration zone]].

Two boatloads of asylum seekers were each detained for several days in the lagoon at Ashmore Island after failed attempts by the [[Royal Australian Navy]] to turn them back to Indonesia in October 2001.
