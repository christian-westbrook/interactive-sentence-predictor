}}'''Alfons Maria Jakob''' (2 July 1884 in [[Aschaffenburg]]/[[Bavaria]] &amp;ndash; 17 October 1931 in [[Hamburg]]) was a German [[neurologist]] who worked in the field of [[neuropathology]].

He was born in [[Aschaffenburg]], [[Bavaria]] and educated in [[medicine]] at the universities of [[University of Munich|Munich]], [[University of Berlin|Berlin]], and [[University of Strasbourg|Strasbourg]], where he received his doctorate in 1908. During the following year, he began clinical work under the [[psychiatrist]] [[Emil Kraepelin]] and did laboratory work with [[Franz Nissl]] and [[Alois Alzheimer]] in [[Munich]].&lt;ref name=WN&gt;[http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/738.html Alfons Maria Jakob] at [[Who Named It]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, by way of an invitation from [[Wilhelm Weygandt]],&lt;ref name=NE&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JIkqCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT422&amp;lpg=PT422&amp;dq=%22Alfons+Maria+Jakob%22+1884&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cWpu4-Qd3g&amp;sig=ypftuqt9gBRY4AB44Fbo4mH4GII&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrvZCM3qLLAhVqsoMKHQGvBBs4ChDoAQgtMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Alfons%20Maria%20Jakob%22%201884&amp;f=false Neurological Eponyms] edited by Peter J. Koehler, George W. Bruyn, John M. S. Pearce&lt;/ref&gt; he relocated to [[Hamburg]], where he worked with [[Theodor Kaes]] and eventually became head of the laboratory of [[anatomical pathology]] at the psychiatric State Hospital Hamburg-Friedrichsberg. Following the death of Kaes in 1913, Jakob succeeded him as [[prosector]].&lt;ref name=WN/&gt; During [[World War I]] he served as an army physician in [[Belgium]],&lt;ref name=NE/&gt; and afterwards returned to Hamburg. In 1919 he obtained his [[habilitation]] for [[neurology]] and in 1924 became a professor of neurology. Under Jakob's guidance the department grew rapidly. He made significant contributions to knowledge on [[concussion]] and secondary nerve degeneration and became a doyen of [[neuropathology]].&lt;ref name=WH&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-TGgBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=%22Alfons+Maria+Jakob%22+1884&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LtqjFg23Fr&amp;sig=3UCfnUch2px79KIN-MOocNcIZS8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWvJ2f6aLLAhXmyIMKHUZrCRw4ChDoAQgvMAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Alfons%20Maria%20Jakob%22%201884&amp;f=false The Man Behind the Syndrome] by Greta Beighton&lt;/ref&gt;

Jakob was the author of five monographs and nearly 80 scientific papers.&lt;ref name=NE/&gt; His neuropathological research contributed greatly to the delineation of several diseases, including [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[Friedreich's ataxia]]. He first recognised and described [[Alper's disease]] and [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] (named along with Munich neuropathologist [[Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt]]).&lt;ref name=WN/&gt; He gained experience in [[neurosyphilis]], having a 200-bed ward devoted entirely to that disorder. Jakob made a lecture tour of the United States (1924) and South America (1928), of which, he wrote a paper on the neuropathology of [[yellow fever]].&lt;ref name=WH/&gt;&lt;ref name=NE/&gt;

He suffered from chronic [[osteomyelitis]] for the last seven years of his life. This eventually caused a retroperitoneal [[abscess]] and [[Paralysis|paralytic]] [[ileus]] from which he died following operation.&lt;ref name=WN/&gt;
