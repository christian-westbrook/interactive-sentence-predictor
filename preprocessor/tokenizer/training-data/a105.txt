'''Andorra''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Andorra.ogg|æ|n|ˈ|d|ɔːr|ə}}; {{IPA-ca|ənˈdorə|lang}}, {{IPA-ca|anˈdɔra|local}}), officially the '''Principality of Andorra''' ({{lang-ca|Principat d'Andorra}}), also called the '''Principality of the Valleys of Andorra'''&lt;ref&gt;Funk and Wagnalls Encyclopedia, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ca|Principat de les Valls d'Andorra|links=no}}), is a [[sovereign]] [[landlocked country|landlocked]] [[microstate]] in [[Iberian Peninsula|Southwestern Europe]], located in the eastern [[Pyrenees]] mountains and bordered by [[Spain]] and [[France]]. Created under a charter in 988, the present principality was formed in 1278. It is known as a [[principality]] as it is a [[coregency|diarchy]] headed by two [[Co-Princes of Andorra|Co-Princes]]{{snd}}the Catholic [[Bishop of Urgell]] in Spain, and the [[President of France]].

==Etymology==
The origin of the word ''Andorra'' is unknown, although several hypotheses have been formulated. The oldest derivation of the word ''Andorra'' is from the Greek historian [[Polybius]] (''[[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]]'' III, 35, 1) who describes the ''Andosins'', an [[Iberians|Iberian]] [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|Pre-Roman tribe]], as historically located in the valleys of Andorra and facing the [[Carthaginian]] army in its passage through the Pyrenees during the [[Punic Wars]]. The word ''Andosini'' or ''Andosins'' (Ἀνδοσίνους) may derive from the [[Basque language|Basque]] ''handia'' whose meaning is &quot;big&quot; or &quot;giant&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diccionari&quot;&gt;''Diccionari d'Història de Catalunya''; ed. 62; Barcelona; 1998; {{ISBN|84-297-3521-6}}; p. 42; entrada &quot;Andorra&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Andorran [[toponymy]] shows evidence of [[Basque language]] in the area. Another theory suggests that the word ''Andorra'' may derive from the old word ''Anorra'' that contains the Basque word ''ur'' (water).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Font Rius |first=José María |title=Estudis sobre els drets i institucions locals en la Catalunya medieval |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JQL6rtB8VtQC&amp;pg=PA743&amp;dq=Anorra+andorra&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DcwZT6_ALYzs-gaKmt3OCg&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Anorra%20andorra&amp;f=false |publisher=Edicions Universitat Barcelona |year=1985 |page=743 |isbn=8475281745 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory suggests that ''Andorra'' may derive from [[Arabic]] ''al-durra'', meaning &quot;The forest&quot; (الدرة). When the [[Moors]] colonized the [[Iberian Peninsula]], the valleys of the Pyrenees were covered by large tracts of forest, and other regions and towns, also administered by Muslims, received this designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Andorra, the Hidden Republic: Its Origin and Institutions, and the Record of a Journey Thither|year=1912|page=9|last=Gaston|first=L. L.|publisher=McBridge, Nast &amp; Co|location=New York, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theories suggest that the term derives from the [[Navarro-Aragonese]] ''andurrial'', which means &quot;land covered with bushes&quot; or &quot;scrubland&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Andorra |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[folk etymology]] holds that [[Charlemagne]] had named the region as a reference to the [[Biblical]] [[Cannan|Canaanite]] valley of ''[[Endor (village)|Endor]]'' or ''[[Endor (village)|Andor]]'' (where the [[Midianites]] had been defeated), a name also bestowed by his heir and son [[Louis le Debonnaire]] after defeating the Moors in the &quot;wild valleys of Hell&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Images of the Medieval Peasant|page=189|last=Freedman|first=Paul|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=CA, USA|year=1999|isbn=9780804733731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Andorra}}

=== Prehistory ===
[[File:Gravats_del_Roc_de_les_Bruixes.JPG|left|thumb|''Roc de les Bruixes'' prehistorical sanctuary located in [[Canillo]] (detail).]]

[[File:Ann%C3%ADbal,_andosins.png|right|thumb|[[Hannibal]]'s route (in red) during the [[Second Punic War]]. The Iberian tribes (in green) fought against the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] army in the Pyrenees.]]

''La Balma de la [[La Margineda|Margineda]]'' found by [[archaeologist]]s at [[Sant Julia de Loria]] were the first temporal settled in 10,000 BC as a passing place between the two sides of the Pyrenees. The seasonal camp was perfectly located for hunting and fishing by the groups of hunter-gatherers from [[Ariège (river)|Ariege]] and [[Segre (river)|Segre]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140421050925/http://www.elcami.cat/principat-andorra/andorra/andorra-vella/margineda]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Neolithic Age]] the group of humans moved to the [[Madriu-Perafita-Claror Valley|Valley of Madriu]] (nowaday Natural Parc located in [[Escaldes-Engordany]] declared [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]) as a permanent camp in 6640 BC. The population of the valley grew cereals, raised domestic livestock and developed a commercial trade with people from the [[Segre]] and [[Occitania]].{{sfn|Guillamet Antoni|2009|p = 32, 33}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 44 a 92}}

Other archaeological deposits include the ''Tombs of [[Segudet]]'' ([[Ordino]]) and ''Feixa del Moro'' (Sant Julia de Loria) both dated in 4900–4300 BC as an example of the [[Urnfield culture|Urn culture]] in Andorra.{{sfn|Guillamet Antoni|2009|p = 32, 33}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 44 a 92}}
The model of small settlements begin to evolved as a complex urbanism during the [[Bronze Age]]. [[Metallurgy|Metallurgical]] items of iron, ancient coins and relicaries can be found in the [[Sanctuary|ancient sanctuaries]] scattered around the country.

The [[sanctuary]] of ''Roc de les Bruixes'' (Stone of the Witches) is maybe the most important archeological complex of this Age in Andorra, located in the parish of [[Canillo]], about the rituals of funerals, ancient scripture and engraved stone [[mural]]s.{{sfn|Guillamet Antoni|2009|p = 34, 35, 38, 39}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 44 a 92}}

===The Iberian and Roman Andorra===
The inhabitants of the valleys were traditionally associated with the [[Iberians]] and historically located in Andorra as the Iberian tribe ''Andosins'' or ''Andosini'' (Ἀνδοσίνους) during the VII and II centuries BC. Influenced by [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanias]], [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Iberian languages]] the locals developed some current toponyms. Early writings and documents relating this group of people goes back to the second century BC by the Greek writer [[Polybius]] in his ''Histories'' during the [[Punic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100522044257/http://www15.gencat.net/pres_casa_llengues/mapes/mapes.html?idioma=1&amp;start=cercador]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Guillamet Antoni|2009|p = 43}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 44 a 92}}{{sfn|Guillamet Antoni|2009|p = 37, 36}}

Some of the most significant remains of this era are the Castle of the ''Roc d'Enclar'' (part of the early [[Marca Hispanica]]),{{sfn|Guillamet Antoni|2009|p = 44, 45, 46, 47}} ''l'Anxiu'' in [[Les Escaldes]] and ''Roc de L'Oral'' in [[Encamp]].{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 44 a 92}}{{sfn|Guillamet Antoni|2009|p = 37, 36}}
It is known the presence of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] influence from the II century BC to the V century AD. The places found with more Roman presence are in ''Camp Vermell'' (Red Field) in Sant Julia de Loria and in some places in Encamp as well as in the ''Roc d'Enclar''. People continued trading, mainly with wine and cereals, with the Roman cities of [[Urgellet]] (nowaday [[La Seu d'Urgell]]) and all across Segre through the ''[[Roman roads|Via Romana]] Strata Ceretana'' (also known as ''Strata Confluetana'').{{sfn|Guillamet Antoni|2009|p = 52, 53}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 44 a 92}} {{sfn|Guillamet Antoni|2009|p = 44, 45, 46, 47}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 44 a 92}}

===The Visigoths and Carolingians: the legend of Charlemagne===
[[File:Charlemagne_et_Louis_le_Pieux.jpg|right|thumb|[[Charlemagne]] instructing his son [[Louis the Pious]]]]

After the [[fall of the Roman Empire]] Andorra was under the influence of the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigoths]], not directly from the [[History of Toledo, Spain#Visigothic Toledo|Kingdom of Toledo]] by distance, but more particular from the [[Diocese of Urgell]]. The Visigoths remained during 200 years in the valleys, a period in which [[Gothic Christianity|Christianization]] takes place within the country. The fall of the Visigoths came from the [[Al-Andalus|Muslim Empire]] and its [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|conquest]] of the Iberian Peninsula. Andorra remained away from these invasions by the [[Francia|Franks]].{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009}}

Tradition holds that ''Charles the Great'' ([[Charlemagne]]) granted a charter to the Andorran people, under the command of ''Marc Almugaver'' and an army of five thousand soldiers, in return for fighting against the [[Moors]] near [[Porté-Puymorens]] ([[Cerdanya]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://turisme.andorralavella.ad/llegendes-tradicionals/pas-carlemany|title=El pas de Carlemany - Turisme Andorra la Vella|website=turisme.andorralavella.ad|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parr%C3%B2quies_andorra.png|left|thumb|The six old parishes named by their [[patron saint]] as depicted in the ''Acta de Consagració i Dotació de la Catedral de la Seu d'Urgell'' (839)]]

Andorra remained part of the Marca Hispanica of the [[Frankish Empire]] being [[Feudalism|overlordship]] of the territory the [[Count of Urgell]] and eventually by the [[Bishop of Urgel|bishop]] of the Diocese of Urgell. Also tradition holds that it was guaranteed by the son of Charlemagne, [[Louis the Pious]], writing the ''Carta de Poblament'' or a local [[municipal charter]] circa 805.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpuntavui.cat/article/19-cultura/933027-andorra-mira-els-arxius.html|title=Andorra mira els arxius|first=Jaume|last=Vidal|website=Elpuntavui.cat|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 988, [[Borrell II]], Count of Urgell, gave the Andorran valleys to the Diocese of Urgell in exchange for land in Cerdanya.&lt;ref name=&quot;histo1&quot;&gt;{{Cite GREC|title=La formació d'Andorra|NDCHEC=0003864|en=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the Bishop of Urgell, based in Seu d'Urgell, has been [[Co-Princes of Andorra|Co-prince]] of Andorra.&lt;ref name=elements&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coprince-fr.ad/catala/elements.htm |title=Elements de la història del Principat d'Andorra |language=Catalan |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20100209181327/http://www.coprince-fr.ad/catala/elements.htm |archivedate= 9 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first document that mentions ''Andorra'' as a territory is the ''Acta de Consagració i Dotació de la Catedral de la Seu d'Urgell'' (Deed of Consecration and Endowment of the Cathedral of La Seu d'Urgell). The old document dated from 839 depicts the six old [[Parishes of Andorra|parishes]] of the Andorran valleys and therefore the administrative division of the country.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 96 a 146}}

===Medieval Age: The Paréages and the founding of the Co-Principality===
[[File:Esgl%C3%A9sia_de_Sant_Joan_de_Caselles_-_7.jpg|thumb|[[Sant Joan de Caselles]] church, dating from the 11th century, part of the Andorran Romanesque heritage]]
Before 1095, Andorra did not have any type of military protection and the Bishop of Urgell, who knew that the Count of Urgell wanted to reclaim the Andorran valleys,&lt;ref name=elements/&gt; asked the [[Lord of Caboet]] for help and protection. In 1095 the Lord of Caboet and the Bishop of Urgell signed under oath a declaration of their co-sovereignty over Andorra. Arnalda, daughter of Arnau of Caboet, married the Viscount of Castellbò and both became Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya. Years later their daughter, Ermessenda,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite GREC|title=Ermessenda de Castellbò|NDCHEC=0024413|en=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; married [[Roger-Bernard II, Count of Foix|Roger Bernat II]], the French [[Count of Foix]]. They became Roger Bernat II and Ermessenda I, Counts of Foix, Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya, and co-sovereigns of Andorra (shared with the Bishop of Urgell).

In the 13th century, a military dispute arose between the Bishop of Urgell and the Count of Foix as aftermath of the [[Cathar Crusade]]. The conflict was resolved in 1278 with the mediation of the king of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Pere el Gran|Pere II]] between the Bishop and the Count,  by the signing of the first [[Paréage of Andorra 1278|paréage]] which provided that Andorra's sovereignty be shared between the count of Foix&lt;ref name=elements/&gt; (whose title would ultimately transfer to the French head of state) and the Bishop of Urgell, in [[Catalonia]]. This gave the [[principality]] its territory and political form.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 96 a 146}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009}}{{sfn|Jordi Planellas|2013}}

A second paréage was signed in 1288 after a dispute when the [[Roger-Bernard III, Count of Foix|Count of Foix]] ordered the construction of a castle in ''Roc d'Enclar''.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 96 a 146}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009}}{{sfn|Jordi Planellas|2013}} The document was ratified by the noble notary [[County of Cerdanya|Jaume Orig of Puigcerdà]] and the construction of military structures in the country was prohibited.{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|p = 60, 61}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 96 a 146}}

In 1364 the political organization of the country named the figure of the [[syndic]] (now spokesman and president of the parliament) as representative of the Andorrans to their co-princes making possible the creation of [[Parishes of Andorra|local departments]] (''comuns'', ''quarts'' and ''veïnats''). After being ratified by the Bishop Francesc Tovia and the Count [[John I, Count of Foix|Jean I]], the ''Consell de la Terra'' or [[General Council (Andorra)|Consell General de les Valls]] (General Council of the Valleys) was founded in 1419, the second oldest parliament in Europe. The syndic Andreu d'Alàs and the General Council organized the creation of the [[Politics of Andorra#Judicial branch|Justice Courts]] (''La Cort de Justicia'') in 1433 with the Co-Princes and the collection of taxes like ''foc i lloc'' (literally ''fire and site'', a national tax active since then).{{sfn|Guillamet Antoni|2009|p = 78, 79, 80, 81, 88, 89}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009}}

Although we can find remains of ecclesiastical works dating before the 9th century (''Sant Vicenç d'Enclar'' or [[Església de Santa Coloma]]), Andorra developed an exquisite [[Romanesque Art and Architecture|Romanesque Art]] during the 9th and 14th centuries, as much in the construction of churches, bridges, religious murals and statues of the [[Virgin and Child]] (being the most important the [[Our Lady of Meritxell]]).{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009}} Nowadays, the [[List of regional characteristics of Romanesque churches#Romanesque churches in Spain.2C Portugal and Andorra|Romanesque]] buildings that form part of [[Cultural Heritage of Andorra|Andorra's cultural heritage]] stand out in a remarkable way, with an emphasis on [[Església de Sant Esteve]], [[Sant Joan de Caselles]], [[Església de Sant Miquel d'Engolasters]], [[Sant Martí de la Cortinada]] and the medieval bridges of [[Pont de la Margineda|Margineda]] and [[Pont dels Escalls|Escalls]] among many others.{{sfn|Guillamet Antoni|2009|p = 48, 49,}}{{sfn|Garcia|2011}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 150 a 194}}

While the Catalan Pyrenees were embryonic of the [[Catalan language]] at the end of the 11th century Andorra was influenced by the appearance of that language where it was adopted by proximity and influence even decades before it was expanded by the rest of the Kingdom of Aragon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webs.racocatala.cat/cat1714/d/histcat.pdf|format=PDF|title=HISTÒRIA DE LA LLENGUA CATALANA|website=Racocatala.cat|accessdate=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The local population based its economy during the Middle Ages in the livestock and agriculture, as well as in furs and weavers. Later, at the end of the 11th century, the first [[Bloomery#Medieval Europe|foundries of iron]] began to appear in Northern Parishes like [[Ordino]], much appreciated by the master artisans who developed the art of the forges, an important economic activity in the country from the 15th century.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009}}{{sfn|Anne Doustaly-Dunyach|2011}}

In 1601 the [[Andorra#Law and criminal justice|Tribunal de Corts]] (High Court of Justice) was created as a result of [[Huguenot rebellions]] from France, [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] courts coming from Spain and [[Catalan mythology about witches|indigenous witchcraft]] experienced in the country due to the [[Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]].{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|p=44, 45, 47, 48, 50}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|p = 108, 109}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 238, 239}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 238, 239}}  With the passage of time, the co-title to Andorra passed to the kings of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]. After Henry of Navarre became King [[Henry IV of France]], he issued an edict in 1607, that established the head of the French state and the Bishop of Urgell as [[Co-Princes of Andorra]]. During 1617 communal councils form the ''sometent'' (popular militia or army) to deal with the rise of ''bandolerisme'' ([[brigandage]]) and the Consell de la Terra was defined and structured in terms of its composition, organization and competences current today .{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|p=44, 45, 47, 48, 50}}{{sfn|Jordi Planellas|2013|p = 42}}{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|p = 53, 54, 56}}

Andorra continues with the same economic system that it had during the 12th-14th centuries with a large production of metallurgy (''fargues'', a system similar to ''Farga catalana'') and with the introduction of [[tobacco]] circa 1692 and import trade. The [[fair]] of Andorra la Vella was ratified by the co-princes in 1371 and 1448 being the most important annual national festival commercially ever since.{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|p=14}}{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|p=15}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|p = 134}}

The country had a unique and experienced [[guild]] of weavers, ''Confraria de Paraires i Teixidors'', located in [[Escaldes-Engordany]] founded in 1604 taking advantage of the thermal waters of the area. By the time the country constitutes the social system of ''prohoms'' (wealthy society) and ''casalers'' (rest of the population with smaller economic acquisition), deriving to the tradition of ''[[pubilla]]'' and [[Heir|''hereu'']].{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|p=20, 21}}{{sfn|Guillamet Antoni|2009|p=106, 107}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|p = 105, 106, 107, 140, 141}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 263 a 270}}

Three centuries after its foundation the Consell de la Terra locates its headquarters and the Tribunal de Corts in [[Casa de la Vall]] in 1702. The [[manor house]] built in 1580 served as a noble fortress of the Busquets family. Inside the parliament was placed the ''Closet of the six keys'' (''Armari de les sis claus'') representative of each Andorran parish and where the [[Andorran constitution]] and other documents and laws were kept later on.{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|p=60}}{{sfn|Guillamet Antoni|2009|p = 82}}

In both [[Guerra dels Segadors]] and [[Guerra de Sucesión Española]] conflicts, the Andorran people (although with the statement neutral country) supported the [[Catalans]] who saw their [[Catalan constitutions|rights]] reduced in [[Nueva Planta decrees|1716]]. The reaction was the promotion of Catalan writings in Andorra, with cultural works such as the ''Book of Privileges'' (''Llibre de Privilegis de 1674''), ''Manual Digest'' (1748) by Antoni Fiter i Rossell or the ''Polità andorrà'' (1763) by Antoni Puig.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 229}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 229}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 229}}{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|p = 49 a 52, i 57, 58}}

After the French Revolution Napoleon I reestablished in 1809 the Co-Principate and deleted the French medieval tithe. Although in 1812–13, the [[First French Empire]] annexed Catalonia during the [[Peninsular War]] (''Guerra del francés'') and divided it in four [[département]]s, with Andorra being made part of the district of [[Puigcerdà]] (département of [[Sègre]]). In 1814 a royal decree reestablished the independence and economy of Andorra.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 172}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|p = 172}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 342, 343}}

Andorra retained its late medieval institutions and rural culture largely unchanged during this period. In 1866 the syndic [[Casa d'Areny-Plandolit|Guillem d'Areny-Plandolit]] lead the ''reformist'' group in a Council General of 24 members, elected by suffrage limited to heads of families, replaced the aristocratic oligarchy that previously ruled the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Page 966, Volume 1, [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], Eleventh Edition 1910–1911&lt;/ref&gt; The New Reform (''Nova Reforma'' or  ''Pla de Reforma'') began after being ratified by both Co-Princes and established the basis of the [[Constitution of Andorra|constitution]] and symbols (such as the [[Flag of Andorra|tricolor flag]]) of Andorra.

The authorities of the Co-Princes (''veguer'') banned casinos and betting houses throughout the country by establishing an economic conflict with the demand of the Andorran people. The conflict led to the so-called ''Revolution of 1881'' or ''Troubles of Andorra'', when revolutionaries assaulted the house of the syndic during 8 December 1880 and established the ''Provisional Revolutionary Council'' led by Joan Pla i Calvo and Pere Baró i Mas, who granted the construction of casinos and spas to foreign companies.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 198, 199, 203}} During 7 and 9 June 1881, the loyalists of [[Canillo]] and [[Encamp]] reconquered the parishes of [[Ordino]] and [[Massana]] by establishing contact with the revolutionary forces in [[Escaldes-Engordany]].{{sfn|Peruga Guerrero|1998|p = 59, 60, 63}}  After a day of combat finally the [[Pont dels Escalls|Treaty of the Bridge of Escalls]] was signed the 10 of June.{{sfn|Ministeri d'Educació, Joventut i Esports|1996|p = 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 194, 195}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|p = 194, 195}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 348 a 350}}{{sfn|Segalàs|2012|p = 95}}  The Council was replaced and new elections were made but the economic situation worsened with a divided society: the ''Qüestió d'Andorra'' (the ''Andorran Question'' in relation to the [[Eastern Question]]).{{sfn|Peruga Guerrero|1998|p = 64, 65, 66, 67, 68}} The struggles continued between pro-bishops, pro-French and nationalists who derived the troubles of Canillo in 1882 and 1885.{{sfn|Ministeri d'Educació, Joventut i Esports|1996|p = 67 a 70}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|p = 198, 199, 202, 203}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 352, 353}}

Andorra participated in the cultural movement of the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] [[Renaixença]]. Between 1882 and 1887 the first academic schools were formed where trilingualism coexists with the knowledge of the official language, Catalan. Some [[Romanticism|romantic]] authors from both France and Spain reported the awakening of the [[Romantic nationalism|national consciousness]] of the country. [[Jacint Verdaguer]] lived in Ordino during the 1880s where he wrote and share works related to the Renaixença with [[Casa Rossell|Joaquim de Riba]], writer and photographer. [[Fromental Halévy]], for his part, had already premiered in 1848 the opera ''[[Le val d'Andorre|Le Val d'Andorre]]'' of great success in Europe, where the national consciousness of the valleys during the [[Peninsular War]] was exposed in the romantic work.{{sfn|Peruga Guerrero|1998|p = 78, 79, 80, 81}}{{sfn|Ministeri d'Educació, Joventut i Esports|1996|p = 74}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 354, 355, 356, 357}}{{sfn|Àrea de Recerca Històrica del Govern d'Andorra|2006|p = 33}}{{sfn|Segalàs|2012}}

===20th century===
[[File:Borís Skósyrev.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Boris Skossyreff]], briefly self-proclaimed &quot;King of Andorra&quot; in 1934]]
Andorra declared war on [[Imperial Germany]] during World War I, but did not actually take part in the fighting. It remained in an official state of [[belligerency]] until 1958 as it was not included in the [[Treaty of Versailles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DYKAndorra&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=World War I Ends in Andorra |newspaper=New York Times |date=25 September 1958 |page=66 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D06E6DF1530E73BBC4D51DFBF668383649EDE }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, France occupied Andorra following social unrest which occurred before elections. On 12 July 1934, adventurer [[Boris Skossyreff]] issued a proclamation in Urgell, declaring himself &quot;Boris I, King of Andorra&quot;, simultaneously declaring war on the Bishop of Urgell. He was arrested by the Spanish authorities on 20 July and ultimately expelled from [[Spain]]. From 1936 until 1940, a French military detachment was garrisoned in Andorra to secure the principality against disruption from the [[Spanish Civil War]] and [[Francoist Spain]]. Francoist troops reached the Andorran border in the later stages of the war. During World War II, Andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between [[Vichy France]] and [[Spain]].

Given its relative isolation, Andorra has existed outside the mainstream of European history, with few ties to countries other than [[France]], [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]. In recent times, however, its thriving tourist industry along with developments in transport and communications have removed the country from its isolation. Its political system was modernised in 1993, when it became a member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Council of Europe]].

Andorra is a parliamentary [[co-principality]] with the [[President of the French Republic|President of France]] and the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Bishop of Urgell]] ([[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]) as [[List of Co-Princes of Andorra|Co-Princes]]. This peculiarity makes the President of France, in his capacity as [[Prince of Andorra]], an elected reigning monarch, although he is not elected by a popular vote of the Andorran people. The politics of Andorra take place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]], whereby the [[List of heads of government of Andorra|Head of Government]] is the [[head of government|chief executive]], and of a [[wiktionary:pluriform|pluriform]] multi-party system.

The current Head of Government is [[Antoni Martí]] of the [[Democrats for Andorra]] (DA). [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both government and parliament.

The Parliament of Andorra is known as the General Council. The General Council consists of between 28 and 42 Councillors. The Councillors serve for four-year terms, and elections are held between the 30th and 40th days following the dissolution of the previous Council.

Half are elected in equal numbers by each of the seven administrative parishes, and the other half of the Councillors are elected in a single national constituency. Fifteen days after the election, the Councillors hold their inauguration. During this session, the Syndic General, who is the head of the General Council, and the Subsyndic General, his assistant, are elected. Eight days later, the Council convenes once more. During this session the Head of Government is chosen from among the Councillors.

[[File:Casa de la Vall - 18.jpg|thumb|Casa de la Vall, Andorran Parliament]]

Candidates can be proposed by a minimum of one-fifth of the Councillors. The Council then elects the candidate with the absolute majority of votes to be Head of Government. The Syndic General then notifies the Co-Princes, who in turn appoint the elected candidate as the Head of Government of Andorra. The General Council is also responsible for proposing and passing laws. Bills may be presented to the Council as Private Members' Bills by three of the local Parish Councils jointly or by at least one tenth of the citizens of Andorra.

The Council also approves the annual budget of the principality. The government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval at least two months before the previous budget expires. If the budget is not approved by the first day of the next year, the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved. Once any bill is approved, the Syndic General is responsible for presenting it to the Co-Princes so that they may sign and enact it.

If the Head of Government is not satisfied with the Council, he may request that the Co-Princes dissolve the Council and order new elections. In turn, the Councillors have the power to remove the Head of Government from office. After a motion of censure is approved by at least one-fifth of the Councillors, the Council will vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes, the Head of Government is removed.

==Law and criminal justice==
The judiciary is composed of the Magistrates Court, the Criminal Law Court, the High Court of Andorra, and the Constitutional Court. The High Court of Justice is composed of five judges: one appointed by the Head of Government, one each by the Co-Princes, one by the Syndic General, and one by the Judges and Magistrates. It is presided over by the member appointed by the Syndic General and the judges hold office for six-year terms.

The Magistrates and Judges are appointed by the High Court, as is the President of the Criminal Law Court. The High Court also appoints members of the Office of the Attorney General. The Constitutional Court is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and reviewing all appeals of unconstitutionality against laws and treaties. It is composed of four judges, one appointed by each of the Co-Princes and two by the General Council. They serve eight-year terms. The Court is presided over by one of the Judges on a two-year rotation so that each judge at one point will preside over the Court.

==Foreign relations, defence, and security==
{{Main|Foreign relations of Andorra}}
[[File:Bruxelles rue de la Montagne 10.jpg|thumb|The embassy of Andorra in [[Brussels]] ]]
Andorra does not have its own armed forces,&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;/&gt; although there is a small ceremonial army. Responsibility for defending the nation rests primarily with [[France]] and [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-1993-16868 |title=Documento BOE-A-1993-16868 |publisher=BOE.es |date=30 June 1993 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in case of emergencies or natural disasters, the ''Sometent'' (an alarm) is called and all able-bodied men between 21 and 60 of Andorran nationality must serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://turisme.andorralavella.ad/?q=en/node/281 |title=El Sometent &amp;#124; Tourism |publisher=Turisme.andorralavella.ad |date=17 May 2011 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;recarrega.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recarrega.net/arxius/Decret%20veguers%20Sometent,%20del%2023%20d%27octubre%20de%201984.pdf |title=Decret veguers Sometent, del 23 d'octubre de 1984 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is why all Andorrans, and especially the head of each house (usually the eldest able-bodied man of a house) should, by law, keep a rifle, even though the law also states that the police will offer a firearm in case of need.&lt;ref name=&quot;recarrega.net&quot;/&gt; Andorra is a full member of the United Nations (UN), the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), and has a special agreement with the European Union (EU).

===Military===
Andorra has a small army, which has historically been raised or reconstituted at various dates, but has never in modern times amounted to a standing army. The basic principle of Andorran defence is that all able-bodied men are available to fight if called upon by the sounding of the ''Sometent''. Being a [[landlocked country]], Andorra has no [[navy]].

Prior to World War I Andorra maintained an armed force of about 600 part-time militiamen. This body was not liable for service outside the principality and was commanded by two officials (''viguiers'') appointed by France and the Bishop of Urgell.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Despite not being involved in any fighting during the [[World War I|First World War]], Andorra was technically the longest combatant, as the country was left out of the [[Versailles Peace Conference]], [[de jure|technically]] remaining at war with Germany from its original declaration of war in 1914 until 24 September 1958 when Andorra officially declared peace with Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;DYKAndorra&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reich |first=Herb |date=2012 |title=Lies They Teach in School: Exposing the Myths Behind 250 Commonly Believed Fallacies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NsI_ub0Vh7EC |location=New York |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc.|page=52 |isbn=9781620873458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, the army has consisted of a very small body of volunteers willing to undertake ceremonial duties. Uniforms were handed down from generation to generation within families and communities.

The army's role in internal security was largely taken over by the formation of the [[Police Corps of Andorra]] in 1931. Brief civil disorder associated with the elections of 1933 led to assistance being sought from the French [[National Gendarmerie]],&lt;!-- Reference removed, as site quoted is currently on WP blacklist --&gt; with a detachment resident in Andorra for two months under the command of René-Jules Baulard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Cahoon |url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Andorra.html |title=Andorra |publisher=Worldstatesmen.org |date= |access-date=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Andorran Army was reformed in the following year, with eleven soldiers appointed to supervisory roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1157484 |title=Andorra's 'ARMY' – Eleven Permanent Troops! |work=The Times |date=5 January 1934 |access-date=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The force consisted of six [[Corporal]]s, one for each parish (although there are currently seven parishes, there were only six until 1978), plus four junior staff officers to co-ordinate action, and a commander with the rank of major. It was the responsibility of the six corporals, each in his own parish, to be able to raise a fighting force from among the able-bodied men of the parish.

Today a small, twelve-man ceremonial unit remains the only permanent section of the Andorran Army, but all able-bodied men remain technically available for military service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3164.htm |title=Andorra |publisher=State.gov |date=20 April 2012 |access-date=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Can't locate that in the source, but it links to the CIA World factbook, that says:

Military - note:
defense is the responsibility of [[France]] and [[Spain]]--&gt; with a requirement for each family to have access to a firearm. The army has not fought for more than 700 years, and its main responsibility is to present the [[flag of Andorra]] at official ceremonial functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aire.ad/documents/10200707_BOP14073Reglament_atm.pdf |title=Bop14073 |format=PDF |date= |access-date=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andorramania.com/histoire_gb.htm |title=History of the Principality of Andorra |publisher=Andorramania.com |date=11 December 1997 |access-date=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Marc Forné Molné]], Andorra's military budget is strictly from voluntary donations, and the availability of full-time volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/webcast/ga/58/statements/andoeng030925.htm |title=Andorra |publisher=Un.org |date=25 September 2003 |access-date=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The myth that all members of the Andorran Army are ranked as officers is popularly maintained in many works of reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3164.htm |title=Andorra |publisher=State.gov |date=2013-09-13 |access-date=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Europe/Andorra-POLITICS-GOVERNMENT-AND-TAXATION.html |title=Andorra Politics, government, and taxation, Information about Politics, government, and taxation in Andorra |publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com |date= |access-date=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, all those serving in the permanent ceremonial reserve hold ranks as [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]], or [[non-commissioned officer]]s, because the [[Enlisted rank|other ranks]] are considered to be the rest of the able-bodied male population, who may still be called upon by the ''Sometent'' to serve, although such a call has not been made in modern times.

===Police Corps===
{{Main|Police Corps of Andorra}}
Andorra maintains a small but modern and well-equipped internal police force, with around 240 police officers supported by civilian assistants. The principal services supplied by the corps are uniformed community policing, criminal detection, border control, and traffic policing. There are also small specialist units including police dogs, mountain rescue, and a bomb disposal team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Carles Iglesias Carril |url=http://www.policia.ad/ |title=Andorran Police Service website |publisher=Policia.ad |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====GIPA====
The ''Grup d'Intervenció Policia d'Andorra'' (GIPA) is a small special forces unit trained in [[counter-terrorism]], and [[Hostage negotiator|hostage recovery]] tasks. Although it is the closest in style to an active military force, it is part of the [[Police Corps of Andorra|Police Corps]], and not the [[Military of Andorra|army]]. As terrorist and hostage situations are a rare threat to the nation, the GIPA is commonly assigned to prisoner escort duties, and at other times to routine policing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Carles Iglesias Carril |url=http://www.policia.ad/estructura.html |title=Cos de Policia – Estructura organitzativa |publisher=Policia.ad |date= |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Andorran Fire Brigade'', with headquarters at [[Santa Coloma d'Andorra|Santa Coloma]], operates from four modern fire stations, and has a staff of around 120 firefighters. The service is equipped with 16 heavy appliances (fire tenders, turntable ladders, and specialist four-wheel drive vehicles), four light support vehicles (cars and vans) and four ambulances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bombers.ad/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=80&amp;Itemid=64 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120722172143/http://www.bombers.ad/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=80&amp;Itemid=64 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 July 2012 |title=Vehicle details with extensive photo gallery here |publisher=Bombers.ad |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the families of the six ancient parishes of Andorra maintained local arrangements to assist each other in fighting fires. The first fire pump purchased by the government was acquired in 1943. Serious fires which lasted for two days in December 1959 led to calls for a permanent fire service, and the ''Andorran Fire Brigade'' was formed on 21 April 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bombers.ad/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=83&amp;Itemid=44 |title=Fire Brigade history here (in Catalan) |publisher=Bombers.ad |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120801135702/http://www.bombers.ad/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=83&amp;Itemid=44 |archivedate=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fire service maintains full-time cover with five fire crews on duty at any time{{snd}} two at the brigade's headquarters in Santa Coloma, and one crew at each of the other three fire stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bombers.ad |title=Andorran Fire Service site |publisher=Bombers.ad |date=17 August 2012 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

{{Main|Geography of Andorra|Geology of Andorra}}

===Parishes===
{{Main|Parishes of Andorra}}
Andorra consists of seven parishes:

* [[Andorra la Vella]]
* [[Canillo]]
* [[Encamp]]
* [[Escaldes-Engordany]]
* [[La Massana]]
* [[Ordino]]
* [[Sant Julià de Lòria]]

===Physical geography===
[[File:Grandvalira ski resort, Andorra5.jpg|thumb|right|Scenery of Andorran mountains]]
[[File:Andorra topographic map-en.svg|thumb|Topographic map of Andorra]]

Due to its location in the eastern [[Pyrenees]] mountain range, Andorra consists predominantly of rugged mountains, the highest being the [[Coma Pedrosa]] at {{convert|2942|m|ft|0}}, and the average elevation of Andorra is {{convert|1996|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;Atlas of Andorra (1991), Andorran Government. {{oclc|801960401}}. {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are dissected by three narrow valleys in a Y shape that combine into one as the main stream, the [[Gran Valira]] river, leaves the country for [[Spain]] (at Andorra's lowest point of {{convert|840|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}). Andorra's land area is {{convert|468|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|0}}.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Andorra belongs to the Atlantic European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Andorra belongs to the [[ecoregion]] of Pyrenees conifer and mixed forests.

===Climate===
Andorra has an [[alpine climate]] and [[continental climate]]. Its higher elevation means there is, on average, more snow in winter, lower humidity, and it is slightly cooler in summer.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Andorra}}
[[File:Tree map export 2009 Andorra.jpeg|thumb|Exports in 2009]]
Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's tiny, well-to-do economy, accounts for roughly 80% of GDP. An estimated 10.2&amp;nbsp;million tourists visit annually,&lt;ref name=&quot;es2&quot;/&gt; attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts.

One of the main sources of income in Andorra is tourism from ski resorts which total over {{convert|175|km|0|abbr=on}} of ski ground. The sport brings in over 7 million visitors and an estimated 340 million euros per year, sustaining 2,000 direct and 10,000 indirect jobs at present{{When|date=June 2015}}.

The banking sector, with its [[tax haven]] status, also contributes substantially to the economy (the financial and insurance sector accounts for approximately 19% of GDP&lt;ref name=&quot;fs2013&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aba.ad/pub/publicaciones/financial_system_2013.pdf|format=PDF|title=Andorra and its financial system 2013|publisher=Aba.ad|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The financial system comprises five banking groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebanks.eu/banks-by-country/Andorra |title=List of Banks in Andorra |publisher=Thebanks.eu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; one specialised credit entity, 8 investment undertaking management entities, 3 asset management companies and 29 insurance companies, 14 of which are branches of foreign insurance companies authorised to operate in the principality.&lt;ref name=&quot;fs2013&quot;/&gt;

Agricultural production is limited—only 2% of the land is arable—and most food has to be imported. Some tobacco is grown locally. The principal livestock activity is domestic sheep raising. Manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture. Andorra's natural resources include hydroelectric power, mineral water, timber, iron ore, and lead.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/an.html |title=CIA World Factbook entry: Andorra |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andorra is not a member of the European Union, but enjoys a [[Andorra–European Union relations|special relationship]] with it, such as being treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products. Andorra lacked a currency of its own and used both the [[French franc]] and the [[Spanish peseta]] in banking transactions until 31 December 1999, when both currencies were replaced by the EU's single currency, the euro. Coins and notes of both the franc and the peseta remained legal tender in Andorra until 31 December 2002. Andorra negotiated to issue its own euro coins, beginning in 2014.

Andorra has traditionally had one of the world's lowest unemployment rates. In 2009 it stood at 2.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2129rank.html |title=CIA World Factbook: Andorra |accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andorra has long benefited from its status as a tax haven, with revenues raised exclusively through import tariffs. However, during the [[European sovereign-debt crisis]] of the 21st century, its tourist economy suffered a decline, partly caused by a drop in the prices of goods in [[Spain]], which undercut Andorran [[duty-free shop]]ping. This led to a growth in unemployment. On 1 January 2012, a business tax of 10% was introduced,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andorra gets a taste of taxation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/27/andorra-financial-crisis-tax|work=The guardian|accessdate=30 March 2013|date=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a [[sales tax]] of 2% a year later, which raised just over 14 million euros in its first quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Andorra Unveils First Indirect Tax Revenue Figures|url=http://www.tax-news.com/news/Andorra_Unveils_First_Indirect_Tax_Revenue_Figures____60703.html|newspaper=Tax News|date=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 May 2013, it was announced that Andorra intended to legislate for the introduction of an [[income tax]] by the end of June, against a background of increasing dissatisfaction with the existence of tax havens among EU members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Andorra to introduce income tax for first time|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22745895|newspaper=BBC News|date=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement was made following a meeting in Paris between the Head of Government [[Antoni Marti]] and the French President and Prince of Andorra, [[François Hollande]]. Hollande welcomed the move as part of a process of Andorra &quot;bringing its taxation in line with international standards&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.notretemps.com/argent/andorre-aligne-progressivement-sa,i29431|title=Andorre aligne progressivement sa fiscalité sur les standards internationaux (Elysée)|newspaper=Notre Temps|date=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of Andorra is estimated at {{UN_Population|Andorra}} ({{UN_Population|Year}}).{{UN_Population|ref}} The population has grown from 5,000 in 1900.

Two-thirds of residents lack Andorran nationality and do not have the right to vote in communal elections.

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Andorra}}
The historic and [[official language]] is [[Catalan language|Catalan]], a [[Romance language]]. The Andorran government encourages the use of Catalan. It funds a Commission for Catalan [[Toponymy]] in Andorra (Catalan: ''la Comissió de Toponímia d'Andorra''), and provides free Catalan classes to assist immigrants. Andorran television and radio stations use Catalan.

Because of immigration, historical links, and close geographic proximity, [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[French language|French]] are also commonly spoken. Most Andorran residents can speak one or more of these, in addition to Catalan. English is less commonly spoken among the general population, though it is understood to varying degrees in the major tourist resorts. Andorra is one of only four European countries (together with France, Monaco, and Turkey)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/minorities/default_en.asp |title=Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (FCNM) : National Minorities, '&amp;#39;Council of Europe'&amp;#39;, 14 September 2010 |publisher=Coe.int |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that have never signed the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities|Council of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=157&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG|title=Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities CETS No. 157 |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
The population of Andorra is predominantly (88.2%) Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/2011/12/19/table-christian-population-as-percentages-of-total-population-by-country/ PEW 2011]. Pewforum.org (2011-12-19). Retrieved on 2015-12-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Their patron saint is [[Our Lady of Meritxell]]. Though it is not an official state religion, the constitution acknowledges a special relationship with the Catholic Church, offering some special privileges to that group{{clarify|date=August 2014}}. Other Christian denominations include the [[Anglican Church]], the [[Unification Church]], the [[New Apostolic Church]], and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. The small [[Islam in Andorra|Muslim community]] is primarily made up of North African immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andorra facts|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/places/spain-portugal-italy-greece-and-balkans/spanish-and-portuguese-political-geography/andorra|website=Encyclopedia.com|publisher=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a small community of [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and [[Bahá'í Faith in Andorra|Bahá'ís]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ARDA05&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Andorra | work = International – Regions – Southern Europe | publisher = The Association of Religion Data Archives | year = 2005| url =http://www.thearda.com/internationalData/countries/Country_6_2.asp | accessdate = 4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolfram&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Andorra: population, capital, cities, GDP, map, flag, currency, languages, ... | encyclopedia = [[Wolfram Alpha]] | volume = Online | publisher = Wolfram – Alpha (curated data) | date = 13 March 2010 | url =http://www.wolframalpha.com/entities/countries/andorra/xy/p0/k6/| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120308145150/http://www.wolframalpha.com/entities/countries/andorra/xy/p0/k6/| archivedate =2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and roughly 100 Jews live in Andorra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51537.htm |title=US Dept of State information |publisher=State.gov |date=8 November 2005 |accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[History of the Jews in Andorra]].)

==Education==

===Schools===
Children between the ages of 6 and 16 are required by law to have full-time education. Education up to secondary level is provided free of charge by the government.

There are three systems of school—Andorran, French, and Spanish—which use Catalan, French, and Spanish, respectively, as the main language of instruction. Parents may choose which system their children attend. All schools are built and maintained by Andorran authorities, but teachers in the French and Spanish schools are paid for the most part by [[France]] and [[Spain]]. About 50% of Andorran children attend the French primary schools, and the rest attend Spanish or Andorran schools.

===University of Andorra===
The [[Universitat d'Andorra]] (UdA) is the state public university and is the only university in Andorra. It was established in 1997. The university provides first-level degrees in nursing, computer science, business administration, and educational sciences, in addition to higher professional education courses. The only two graduate schools in Andorra are the Nursing School and the School of Computer Science, the latter having a PhD programme.

====Virtual Studies Centre====
The geographical complexity of the country as well as the small number of students prevents the University of Andorra from developing a full academic programme, and it serves principally as a centre for virtual studies, connected to Spanish and French universities. The Virtual Studies Centre (''Centre d’Estudis Virtuals'') at the University runs approximately twenty different academic degrees at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels in fields including tourism, law, Catalan philology, humanities, psychology, political sciences, audiovisual communication, telecommunications engineering, and East Asia studies. The Centre also runs various postgraduate programmes and continuing-education courses for professionals.

==Healthcare==
Healthcare in Andorra is provided to all employed persons and their families by the government-run social security system, ''[[Caixa Andorrana de Seguretat Social]]'' (CASS), which is funded by employer and employee contributions in respect of salaries. The cost of healthcare is covered by CASS at rates of 75% for out-patient expenses such as medicines and hospital visits, 90% for hospitalisation, and 100% for work-related accidents. The remainder of the costs may be covered by private health insurance. Other residents and tourists require full private health insurance.&lt;ref name=&quot;travenand&quot;&gt;''Travailler en Andorre'' (May 2006), ''Govern d'Andorra, Servei d'Ocupació, p.30.'' {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main hospital, Meritxell, is in [[Escaldes-Engordany]]. There are also 12 primary health care centres in various locations around the principality.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassps&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.cass.ad/web/lacass/professionalSalut/hospitals/Andorra |title=List of specialties with coverage by CASS at the ''Hospital Nostra Senyora de Meritxell'' (2009) |publisher=Online.cass.ad |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 20th century, Andorra had very limited transport links to the outside world, and development of the country was affected by its physical isolation. Even now, the nearest major airports at Toulouse and Barcelona are both three hours' drive from Andorra.

Andorra has a road network of {{convert|279|km|0|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|76|km|0|abbr=on}} is unpaved. The two main roads out of [[Andorra la Vella]] are the CG-1 to the Spanish border, and the CG-2 to the French border via the Envalira Tunnel near [[El Pas de la Casa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mobi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobilitat.ad/CA/default.asp|archive-url=http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20130317185954/http://www.mobilitat.ad/CA/default.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-03-17|title=Agència de Mobilitat, Govern d'Andorra |publisher=Mobilitat.ad}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bus services cover all metropolitan areas and many rural communities, with services on most major routes running half-hourly or more frequently during peak travel times. There are frequent long-distance bus services from Andorra to [[Barcelona]] and [[Toulouse]], plus a daily tour from the former city. Bus services are mostly run by private companies, but some local ones are operated by the government.

There are no airports for fixed-wing aircraft within Andorra's borders but there are, however, heliports in [[La Massana]] (Camí Heliport), [[Arinsal]] and [[Escaldes-Engordany]] with commercial helicopter services&lt;ref name=&quot;heliand&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heliand.com/ |title=Inici – Heliand – Helicopters a Andorra |publisher=Heliand |date= |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;helitrans&quot;&gt;[http://www.helitrans.ad/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715233032/http://www.helitrans.ad/ |date=15 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an airport located in the neighbouring Spanish comarca of [[Alt Urgell]], {{convert|12|km|abbr=off}} south of the Andorran-Spanish border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.gencat.cat/en/actualitat/detall/Aeroport-public-i-comercial-dAndorra-la-Seu-dUrgell-00002|title=Public and regional airport of Andorra-la Seu d’Urgell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since July 2015, [[Andorra–La Seu d'Urgell Airport]] has operated commercial flights to [[Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport|Madrid]] and [[Palma de Mallorca Airport|Palma de Mallorca]], and is the [[airline hub|main hub]] for [[Air Andorra]] and [[Andorra Airlines]].

Nearby airports located in [[Spain]] and [[France]] provide access to international flights for the principality. The nearest airports are at [[Perpignan–Rivesaltes Airport|Perpignan]], France ({{convert|156|km|disp=or|abbr=off}} from Andorra) and [[Lleida-Alguaire Airport|Lleida]], [[Spain]] ({{convert|160|km|disp=or|abbr=off}} from Andorra). The largest nearby airports are at [[Toulouse]], France ({{convert|165|disp=or|km|abbr=off}} from Andorra) and [[Barcelona Airport|Barcelona]], [[Spain]] ({{convert|215|km|disp=or|abbr=off}} from Andorra). There are hourly bus services from both Barcelona and Toulouse airports to Andorra.

The nearest railway station is [[L'Hospitalet-près-l'Andorre]] {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} east of Andorra which is on the {{RailGauge|1435mm}}[[Standard gauge|-gauge]] line from [[Latour-de-Carol]] ({{convert|25|km|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) southeast of Andorra, to [[Toulouse]] and on to Paris by the French [[TGV|high-speed trains]].

==Media and telecommunications==
{{Main|Telecommunications in Andorra}}
{{See also|Andorra Telecom}}
{{update|section|date=November 2015}}
In Andorra, mobile and fixed telephone and internet services are operated exclusively by the Andorran national telecommunications company, SOM, also known as [[Andorra Telecom]] (STA). The same company also manages the technical infrastructure for national broadcasting of digital television and radio.

By the end of 2010, it was planned that every home in the country would have fibre-to-the-home for internet access at a minimum speed of 100&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s,&lt;ref name=&quot;somfo&quot;&gt;SOM Newsletter, March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and the availability was complete in June 2012.
