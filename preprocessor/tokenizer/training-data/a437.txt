An '''algebraic number''' is any [[complex number]] that is a [[root of a function|root]] of a non-zero [[polynomial]] in one variable with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients (or equivalently – by clearing [[denominator]]s – with [[integer]] coefficients). All [[integer]]s and [[rational number]]s are algebraic, as are all roots of integers. The same is not true for all [[real number|real]] and [[complex number]]s because they also include [[transcendental number]]s such as [[Pi|{{pi}}]] and [[e (mathematical constant)|e]]. [[Almost all]] real and complex numbers are transcendental.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Properties|Properties]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
*The [[rational number]]s, expressed as the quotient of two [[integer]]s ''a'' and ''b'', ''b'' not equal to zero, satisfy the above definition because {{nowrap|1=''x'' = {{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} is the root of {{nowrap|''bx'' − ''a''}}.&lt;ref&gt;Some of the following examples come from Hardy and Wright 1972:159–160 and pp. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[quadratic surd]]s (irrational roots of a quadratic polynomial {{nowrap|''ax''{{sup|2}} + ''bx'' + ''c''}} with integer coefficients ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'') are algebraic numbers. If the quadratic polynomial is monic ({{nowrap|1=''a'' = 1}}) then the roots are [[quadratic integer]]s.
*The [[constructible number]]s are those numbers that can be constructed from a given unit length using straightedge and compass. These include all quadratic surds, all rational numbers, and all numbers that can be formed from these using the [[Arithmetic#Arithmetic operations|basic arithmetic operations]] and the extraction of square roots. (Note that by designating cardinal directions for 1, −1, ''i'', and −''i'', complex numbers such as {{nowrap|3 + {{sqrt|2}}''i''}} are considered constructible.)
*Any expression formed from algebraic numbers using any combination of the basic arithmetic operations and extraction of [[nth root|''n''th roots]] gives another algebraic number.
*Polynomial roots that ''cannot'' be expressed in terms of the basic arithmetic operations and extraction of ''n''th roots (such as the roots of {{nowrap|''x''{{sup|5}} − ''x'' + 1}}). This [[Abel–Ruffini theorem|happens with many]], but not all, polynomials of degree 5 or higher.
*[[Gaussian integer]]s: those complex numbers {{nowrap|''a'' + ''bi''}} where both ''a'' and ''b'' are integers are also quadratic integers.
*[[Trigonometric functions]] of [[rational number|rational]] multiples of {{pi}} (except when undefined): that is, the [[trigonometric number]]s. For example, each of {{nowrap|cos {{sfrac|{{pi}}|7}}}}, {{nowrap|cos {{sfrac|3{{pi}}|7}}}}, {{nowrap|cos {{sfrac|5{{pi}}|7}}}} satisfies {{nowrap|1=8''x''{{sup|3}} − 4''x''{{sup|2}} − 4''x'' + 1 = 0}}. This polynomial is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] over the rationals, and so these three cosines are ''conjugate'' algebraic numbers. Likewise, {{nowrap|tan {{sfrac|3{{pi}}|16}}}}, {{nowrap|tan {{sfrac|7{{pi}}|16}}}}, {{nowrap|tan {{sfrac|11{{pi}}|16}}}}, {{nowrap|tan {{sfrac|15{{pi}}|16}}}} all satisfy the irreducible polynomial {{nowrap|1=''x''{{sup|4}} − 4''x''{{sup|3}} − 6''x''{{sup|2}} + 4x + 1}}, and so are conjugate [[algebraic integers]].
*Some [[irrational number]]s are algebraic and some are not:
**The numbers {{sqrt|2}} and {{sfrac|{{radic|3|3}}|2}} are algebraic since they are roots of polynomials {{nowrap|''x''{{sup|2}} − 2}} and {{nowrap|8''x''{{sup|3}} − 3}}, respectively.
**The [[golden ratio]] ''φ'' is algebraic since it is a root of the polynomial {{nowrap|''x''{{sup|2}} − ''x'' − 1}}.
**The numbers [[Pi|{{pi}}]] and [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']] are not algebraic numbers (see the [[Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem]]);&lt;ref&gt;Also [[Liouville number|Liouville's theorem]] can be used to &quot;produce as many examples of transcendental numbers as we please,&quot; cf Hardy and Wright p.&amp;nbsp;161ff&lt;/ref&gt; hence they are transcendental.

*The set of algebraic numbers is [[countable set|countable]] (enumerable).&lt;ref&gt;Hardy and Wright 1972:160 / 2008:205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niven 1956, Theorem 7.5.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Hence, the set of algebraic numbers has [[Lebesgue measure]] zero (as a subset of the complex numbers), i.e. &quot;[[Almost everywhere|almost all]]&quot; complex numbers are not algebraic.
*Given an algebraic number, there is a unique [[monic polynomial]] (with rational coefficients) of least [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] that has the number as a root. This polynomial is called its [[minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]]. If its minimal polynomial has degree ''n'', then the algebraic number is said to be of ''degree n''. An algebraic number of degree 1 is a [[rational number]]. A real algebraic number of degree 2 is a [[quadratic irrational]].
*All algebraic numbers are [[computable number|computable]] and therefore [[definable number|definable]] and [[arithmetical numbers|arithmetical]].
*The set of real algebraic numbers is [[linearly ordered]], countable, [[densely ordered]], and without first or last element, so is [[order-isomorphic]] to the set of rational numbers.
*For real numbers ''a'' and ''b'', the complex number ''a'' + ''bi'' is algebraic if and only if both ''a'' and ''b'' are algebraic.&lt;ref&gt;Niven 1956, Corollary 7.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The field of algebraic numbers==
[[File:Algebraic number in the complex plane.png|thumb|Algebraic numbers colored by degree (blue=4, cyan=3, red=2, green=1). The unit circle is black.]]
The sum, difference, product and quotient (if the denominator is nonzero) of two algebraic numbers is again algebraic (this fact can be demonstrated using the [[resultant]]), and the algebraic numbers therefore form a [[field (mathematics)|field]] &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline;&quot;&gt;'''Q'''&lt;/span&gt; (sometimes denoted by '''A''', though this usually denotes the [[adele ring]]). Every root of a polynomial equation whose coefficients are ''algebraic numbers'' is again algebraic. This can be rephrased by saying that the field of algebraic numbers is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]]. In fact, it is the smallest algebraically closed field containing the rationals, and is therefore called the [[algebraic closure]] of the rationals.

The set of ''real'' algebraic numbers itself forms a field.&lt;ref&gt;Niven 1956, p.&amp;nbsp;92.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related fields==

===Numbers defined by radicals===
All numbers that can be obtained from the integers using a [[finite set|finite]] number of integer [[addition]]s, [[subtraction]]s, [[multiplication]]s, [[division (mathematics)|division]]s, and taking ''n''th roots where ''n'' is a positive integer (i.e., [[radical expression]]s) are algebraic. The converse, however, is not true: there are algebraic numbers that cannot be obtained in this manner. All of these numbers are roots of polynomials of degree ≥5. This is a result of [[Galois theory]] (see [[Quintic equation]]s and the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]]). An example of such a number is the unique real root of the polynomial {{nowrap|''x''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; − ''x'' − 1}} (which is approximately 1.167304).

===Closed-form number===
{{Main|Closed-form number}}
Algebraic numbers are all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials, starting from the rational numbers. One may generalize this to &quot;[[closed-form number]]s&quot;, which may be defined in various ways. Most broadly, all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms are called &quot;elementary numbers&quot;, and these include the algebraic numbers, plus some transcendental numbers. Most narrowly, one may consider numbers ''explicitly'' defined in terms of polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms – this does not include all algebraic numbers, but does include some simple transcendental numbers such as ''e'' or log(2).

==Algebraic integers==
{{Main|Algebraic integer}}
[[Image:Leadingcoeff.png|thumb|Algebraic numbers colored by leading coefficient (red signifies 1 for an algebraic integer)]]
An '''[[algebraic integer]]''' is an algebraic number that is a root of  a polynomial with integer coefficients with leading coefficient 1 (a monic polynomial). Examples of algebraic integers are {{nowrap|5 + 13√{{overline|2}}}}, {{nowrap|2 − 6''i''}}, and {{nowrap|{{sfrac|1|2}}(1 + ''i''√{{overline|3}}).}} Note, therefore, that the algebraic integers constitute a proper [[superset]] of the [[integer]]s, as the latter are the roots of monic polynomials {{nowrap|''x'' − ''k''}} for all {{nowrap|''k'' ∈ '''Z'''.}} In this sense, algebraic integers are to algebraic numbers what [[integer]]s are to [[rational number]]s.

The sum, difference and product of algebraic integers are again algebraic integers, which means that the algebraic integers form a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]. The name ''algebraic integer'' comes from the fact that the only rational numbers that are algebraic integers are the integers, and because the algebraic integers in any [[algebraic number field|number field]] are in many ways analogous to the integers. If ''K'' is a number field, its [[ring of integers]] is the subring of algebraic integers in ''K'', and is frequently denoted as ''O&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;''. These are the prototypical examples of [[Dedekind domain]]s.
