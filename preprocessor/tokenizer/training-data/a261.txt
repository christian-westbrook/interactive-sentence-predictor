'''Andy Warhol''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɔːr|h|ɒ|l}};&lt;ref&gt;''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]'': [http://www.dictionary.com/browse/warhol &quot;Warhol&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; born '''Andrew Warhola'''; August 6, 1928&amp;nbsp;– February 22, 1987) was an American artist, director and producer who was a leading figure in the [[Art movement|visual art movement]] known as [[pop art]]. His works explore the relationship between artistic expression, [[celebrity culture]], and [[advertising]] that flourished by the 1960s, and span a variety of media, including painting, [[silkscreening]], photography, film, and sculpture. Some of his best known works include the silkscreen paintings ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]'' (1962) and ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'' (1962), the experimental film ''[[Chelsea Girls]]'' (1966), and the [[multimedia]] events known as the ''[[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]]'' (1966–67).

Born and raised in [[Pittsburgh]], Warhol initially pursued a successful career as a [[commercial illustrator]]. After exhibiting his work in several [[art gallery|galleries]] in the late 1950s, he began to receive recognition as an influential and controversial artist. His [[New York City|New York]] studio, [[The Factory]], became a well-known gathering place that brought together distinguished [[intellectual]]s, [[drag queen]]s, playwrights, [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] street people, [[Hollywood]] celebrities, and wealthy patrons. He promoted a collection of personalities known as [[Warhol superstars]], and is credited with coining the widely used expression &quot;[[15 minutes of fame]].&quot; In the late 1960s, he managed and produced the [[experimental rock]] band [[The Velvet Underground]] and founded ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine. He authored numerous books, including ''[[The Philosophy of Andy Warhol]]'' and ''[[Popism: The Warhol Sixties]]''. He is also notable as a [[gay]] man who lived openly as such before the [[gay liberation|gay liberation movement]]. After a [[gallbladder]] [[surgery]] in 1987, Warhol died in February of that year at the age of 58.

Warhol has been the subject of numerous retrospective [[art exhibition|exhibitions]], books, and [[I Shot Andy Warhol|feature]] and documentary films.  [[The Andy Warhol Museum]] in his native city of Pittsburgh, which holds an extensive permanent collection of art and archives, is the largest museum in the United States dedicated to a single artist. Many of his creations are very collectible and highly valuable. The highest price ever paid for a Warhol painting is US$105&amp;nbsp;million for a 1963 [[canvas]] titled ''[[Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)]]''; his works include some of the [[List of most expensive paintings|most expensive paintings ever sold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/andy-warhol-painting-sells-105m-article-1.1516240 |title=Andy Warhol painting sells for $105M |work=New York Daily News |date= November 13, 2013|accessdate=November 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 article in ''The Economist'' described Warhol as the &quot;[[bellwether]] of the art market&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14941229 |title=A special report on the art market: The Pop master's highs and lows |work=The Economist |date= November 26, 2009|accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life and beginnings (1928–49)===
[[File:WarholaHousePittsburgh.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Warhol's childhood home. 3252 Dawson Street, [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|South Oakland]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania]]
Warhol was born on August 6, 1928, in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://warholfoundation.org/legacy/biography.html |title=Andy Warhol: Biography |publisher=Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the fourth child of Ondrej Warhola (Americanized as Andrew Warhola, Sr., 1889–1942)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1342249/John-Warhola-dies-aged-85.html  &quot;Elder brother of Andy Warhol, who raised young artist, dies aged 85&quot;], ''Daily Mail'', December 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warhola.com/biography.html |title=Biography |publisher=Warhola.com |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. Bockris, ''Warhol: The Biography'', Da Capo Press, 2009, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Julia Warhola|Julia]] (''née'' Zavacká, 1892–1972),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warhola.com/andysmother.html |title=Mother |publisher=Warhola.com |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose first child was born in their homeland and died before their move to the U.S.

His parents were working-class [[Lemko]]&lt;ref&gt;Paul Robert Magocsi, Ivan Pop, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ovCVDLYN_JgC&amp;pg=PA539], University of Toronto Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Daggett Dillenberger, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KemglT-1jSIC&amp;pg=PA7 Religious Art of Andy Warhol], Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; emigrants from [[Miková|Mikó]] (now called Miková), located in today's northeastern [[Slovakia]], part of the former [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. Warhol's father emigrated to the United States in 1914, and his mother joined him in 1921, after the death of Warhol's grandparents. Warhol's father worked in a coal mine. The family lived at 55 Beelen Street and later at 3252 Dawson Street in the [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]] neighborhood of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bockris&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Victor |last=Bockris |authorlink=Victor Bockris |title=The life and death of Andy Warhol |publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City |year=1989 |pages=4–5 |isbn=0-553-05708-1 |oclc=19631216}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family was [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian Catholic]] and attended [[St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church (Pittsburgh)|St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church]]. Andy Warhol had two older brothers—Pavol (Paul), the oldest, was born before the family emigrated; [[John Warhola|Ján]] was born in Pittsburgh. Pavol's son, [[James Warhola]], became a successful children's book illustrator.

In third grade, Warhol had [[Sydenham's chorea]] (also known as St. Vitus' Dance), the nervous system disease that causes involuntary movements of the extremities, which is believed to be a complication of [[Rheumatic fever|scarlet fever]] which causes skin pigmentation blotchiness.&lt;ref name=&quot;warhol.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warhol.org/collection/aboutandy/andyfaq/ |title=biography |publisher=warhol |accessdate=January 13, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106165536/http://www.warhol.org/collection/aboutandy/andyfaq/ |archivedate=January 6, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a [[Hypochondriasis|hypochondriac]], developing a fear of hospitals and doctors. Often bedridden as a child, he became an outcast at school and bonded with his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Fred Lawrence |last=Guiles |title=Loner at the ball: the life of Andy Warhol |publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=London |year=1989 |isbn=0-593-01540-1 |oclc=19455278}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times when he was confined to bed, he drew, listened to the radio and collected pictures of movie stars around his bed. Warhol later described this period as very important in the development of his personality, skill-set and preferences. When Warhol was 13, his father died in an accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/popart/Andy-Warhol.html |title=The Prince of Pop Art |publisher=Arthistoryarchive.com |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707153626/http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/popart/Andy-Warhol.html |archivedate=July 7, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager, Warhol graduated from [[Schenley High School]] in 1945. Also as a teen, Warhol won a [[Scholastic Art and Writing Awards|Scholastic Art and Writing Award]].&lt;ref&gt;Scholastic Inc., Newsroom, AMERICA’S MOST CREATIVE TEENS NAMED AS NATIONAL 2016 SCHOLASTIC ART &amp; WRITING AWARDS RECIPIENTS, http://mediaroom.scholastic.com/press-release/america-s-most-creative-teens-named-national-2016-scholastic-art-writing-awards-recipi&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from high school, his intentions were to study [[Visual arts education|art education]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in the hope of becoming an art teacher, but his plans changed and he enrolled in the Carnegie Institute of Technology, now [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in Pittsburgh, where he studied [[commercial art]]. During his time there, Warhol joined the campus  Modern Dance Club and Beaux Arts Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andy Warhol: The College Years|url=http://www.warhol.org/responsive/event.aspx?id=2077|website=The Andy Warhol Museum|accessdate=February 9, 2015|ref=warholmuse}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as art director of the student art magazine, ''Cano'', illustrating a cover in 1948&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warhol.org/Warhol/Content/collection/art/earlywork/1998-1-1590|title=warhol:|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209190850/http://www.warhol.org/Warhol/Content/collection/art/earlywork/1998-1-1590/|archivedate=February 9, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a full-page interior illustration in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gopnik|first1=Blake|title=Feb 9, 2015: The Daily Pic|url=http://blakegopnik.com/post/110535434580|website=Blake Gopnik on Art|accessdate=February 9, 2015|ref=gopnik}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are believed to be his first two published artworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gopnik|first1=Blake|title=Feb 9, 2015: The Daily Pic|url=http://blakegopnik.com/post/110535434580|website=Blake Gopnik on Art|accessdate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warhol earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in pictorial design in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he moved to New York City and began a career in magazine illustration and advertising.

===1950s===
Warhol's early career was dedicated to commercial and advertising art, where his first commission had been to draw shoes for ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'' magazine in the late 1940s.&lt;ref name=foot/&gt; In the 1950s, Warhol worked as a [[Footwear|designer]] for shoe manufacturer Israel Miller.&lt;ref name=foot&gt;
Benstock, Shari and Suzanne Ferriss (editors). ''Footnotes: On Shoes'';  Rutgers University Press; February 1, 2001; {{ISBN|978-0813528717}}; pp. 44–48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Israel Miller see [[i.a.]] &quot;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/realestate/10scap.html A Little Jewel Box of a Shoe Store]&quot; by Christopher Gray, ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; American photographer John Coplans recalled that
&lt;blockquote&gt;nobody drew shoes the way Andy did. He somehow gave each shoe a temperament of its own, a sort of sly, [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] kind of sophistication, but the shape and the style came through accurately and the buckle was always in the right place. The kids in the apartment [which Andy shared in New York – note by Coplans] noticed that the [[Shoe#Construction|vamp]]s on Andy's shoe drawings kept getting longer and longer but [Israel] Miller didn't mind. Miller loved them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Warhol's &quot;whimsical&quot; [[Pen-and-ink drawing|ink drawing]]s of shoe advertisements figured in some of his earliest showings at the [[Bodley Gallery]] in New York.

Warhol was an early adopter of the [[Screen printing|silk screen]] printmaking process as a technique for making paintings. While working in the shoe industry, Warhol developed his &quot;blotted line&quot; technique,  applying ink to paper and then blotting the ink while still wet, which was akin to a [[printmaking]] process on the most rudimentary scale. His use of tracing paper and ink allowed him to repeat the basic image and also to create endless variations on the theme, a method that prefigures his 1960s silk-screen canvas.&lt;ref name=foot/&gt; In his book ''[[Popism: The Warhol Sixties]]'', Warhol writes, &quot;When you do something exactly wrong, you always turn up something.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/33886455/ns/today-entertainment/t/warhols-dollar-bills-painting-fetches-millions/ |title=Warhol's dollar bills painting fetches millions|publisher=MSNBC Today |date=November 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sherman&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SC0MCcfRsA8C&amp;pg=PA106 |title=Pop: The Genius of Andy Warhol|author= Tony Scherman, David Dalton|publisher= HarperCollins|date= 2010 |
isbn= 9780060936631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rapid expansion of the [[record industry]], [[RCA Records]] hired Warhol, along with another freelance artist, Sid Maurer, to design album covers and promotional materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Andrew |last1=Oldham |authorlink=Andrew Loog Oldham |author2=Simon Spence |author3=Christine Ohlman |title=2Stoned |publisher=[[Secker and Warburg]] |location=London |year=2002 |isbn=0-436-28015-9 |oclc=50215773|page=137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition marked his [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] debut of pop art.&lt;ref name=&quot;L158&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Lucy R. |last=Lippard |authorlink=Lucy R.

Andy Warhol's first New York solo [[pop art]] exhibition was hosted at Eleanor Ward's [[Stable Gallery]] November 6–24, 1962. The exhibit included the works ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'', ''100 Soup Cans'', ''100 Coke Bottles'', and ''100 Dollar Bills''. At the [[Stable Gallery]] exhibit, the artist met for the first time poet [[John Giorno]] who would star in Warhol's first film, ''[[Sleep (film)|Sleep]]'', in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.warholstars.org/warhol/warhol1/warhol1b/johngiorno.html |work=www.warholstars.org |title=John Giorno }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during the 1960s that Warhol began to make paintings of iconic American objects such as dollar bills, [[mushroom cloud]]s, [[electric chair]]s, [[Campbell's Soup Cans]], [[Coca-Cola]] bottles, celebrities such as [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Marlon Brando]], [[Troy Donahue]], [[Muhammad Ali]], and [[Elizabeth Taylor]], as well as newspaper headlines or photographs of police dogs attacking African-American protesters during the [[Birmingham campaign]] in the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. During these years, he founded his studio, &quot;[[The Factory]]&quot; and gathered about him a wide range of artists, writers, musicians, and underground celebrities. His work became popular and controversial. Warhol had this to say about Coca-Cola:

{{quote|What's great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coca-Cola, Liz Taylor drinks Coca-Cola, and just think, you can drink Coca-Cola, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good. Liz Taylor knows it, the President knows it, the bum knows it, and you know it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Andy |last=Warhol |title=[[The Philosophy of Andy Warhol|The philosophy of Andy Warhol: from A to B and back again]] |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=San Diego |year=1975 |isbn=0-15-189050-1 |oclc=1121125 |pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

New York City's [[Museum of Modern Art]] hosted a Symposium on pop art in December 1962 during which artists such as Warhol were attacked for &quot;capitulating&quot; to consumerism. Critics were scandalized by Warhol's open embrace of market culture. This symposium set the tone for Warhol's reception.

A pivotal event was the 1964 exhibit ''The American Supermarket'', a show held in Paul Bianchini's Upper East Side gallery. The show was presented as a typical U.S. small supermarket environment, except that everything in it—from the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc.—was created by six prominent pop artists of the time, among them the controversial (and like-minded) [[Billy Apple]], Mary Inman, and [[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]]. Warhol's painting of a can of Campbell's soup cost $1,500 while each autographed can sold for $6. The exhibit was one of the first mass events that directly confronted the general public with both pop art and the perennial question of what art is.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

As an [[Commercial art|advertisement illustrator]] in the 1950s, Warhol used assistants to increase his productivity. Collaboration would remain a defining (and controversial) aspect of his working methods throughout his career; this was particularly true in the 1960s. One of the most important collaborators during this period was [[Gerard Malanga]]. Malanga assisted the artist with the production of silkscreens, films, sculpture, and other works at &quot;[[The Factory]]&quot;, Warhol's [[aluminum foil]]-and-silver-paint-lined studio on 47th Street (later moved to Broadway). Other members of Warhol's Factory crowd included [[Freddie Herko]], [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]], [[Ronald Tavel]], [[Mary Woronov]], [[Billy Name]], and [[Brigid Berlin]] (from whom he apparently got the idea to tape-record his phone conversations).&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, Warhol also groomed a retinue of [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] and [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] eccentrics upon whom he bestowed the designation &quot;[[Warhol Superstar|Superstars]]&quot;, including [[Nico]], [[Joe Dallesandro]], [[Edie Sedgwick]], [[Viva (actress)|Viva]], [[Isabelle Collin Dufresne|Ultra Violet]], [[Holly Woodlawn]], [[Jackie Curtis]], and [[Candy Darling]]. These people all participated in the Factory films, and some—like Berlin—remained friends with Warhol until his death. Important figures in the New York underground art/cinema world, such as writer [[John Giorno]] and film-maker [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]], also appear in Warhol films of the 1960s, revealing Warhol's connections to a diverse range of artistic scenes during this time. Less well known was his support and collaboration with several teen-agers during this era, who would achieve prominence later in life including writer David Dalton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Menand|first1=Louis|title=Top of the Pops|work=New Yorker|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/01/11/top-of-the-pops|date=January 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; photographer Stephen Shore&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grow|first1=Krystal|title=Time Lightbox|url=http://lightbox.time.com/2014/09/23/stephen-shore-at-the-factory/#1|publisher=Time Inc.|date=September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and artist Bibbe Hansen (mother of pop musician [[Beck]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=Dagon|title=Billy Name:The Silver Age Black and White Photographs of Andy Warhol's Factory|date=2014|publisher=Reel Art Press|isbn=1909526177|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attempted murder (1968)====
On June 3, 1968, [[radical feminist]] writer [[Valerie Solanas]] shot Warhol and [[Mario Amaya]], art critic and curator, at Warhol's studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schaffner |first=Ingrid |authorlink=Ingrid Schaffner |title=The Essential Andy Warhol |publisher=[[Harry N. Abrams]] |location=New York City |page=79 |year=1999 |isbn=0-8109-5806-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the shooting, Solanas had been a marginal figure in the Factory scene. She authored in 1967 the ''[[S.C.U.M. Manifesto]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Solanas&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Valerie |last=Solanas |authorlink=Valerie Solanas |title=[[SCUM Manifesto]] |publisher=Verso |location=London |origyear=1967 |year=2004 |isbn=1-85984-553-3 |oclc=53932627}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Separatist feminism|separatist feminist]] tract that advocated the elimination of men; and appeared in the 1968 Warhol film ''[[I, a Man]]''. Earlier on the day of the attack, Solanas had been turned away from the Factory after asking for the return of a script she had given to Warhol. The script had apparently been misplaced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jobey&quot;&gt;Jobey, Liz, &quot;Solanas and Son,&quot; ''The Guardian'' (Manchester, England), August 24, 1996, p, T10 and following.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amaya received only minor injuries and was released from the hospital later the same day. Warhol was seriously wounded by the attack and barely survived: surgeons opened his chest and [[internal cardiac massage|massaged his heart]] to help stimulate its movement again. He suffered physical effects for the rest of his life, including being required to wear a surgical corset.&lt;ref name=&quot;warhol.org&quot;/&gt; The shooting had a profound effect on Warhol's life and art.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harding&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Harding |first=James |title=The Simplest Surrealist Act: Valerie Solanas and the (Re)Assertion of Avantgarde Priorities |journal=[[TDR (journal)|TDR/The Drama Review]] |volume=45 |issue=4; Winter 2001 |pages=142–162 |doi=10.1162/105420401772990388|year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;popism287-295&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Andy |last1=Warhol |author2=Pat Hacket |title=POPism: the Warhol '60s |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=New York |year=1980 |pages=287–295 |isbn=0-15-173095-4 |oclc=5673923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solanas was arrested the day after the assault, after turning herself in to police. By way of explanation, she said that Warhol &quot;had too much control over my life.&quot; She was subsequently diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenia]] and eventually sentenced to three years under the control of the [[New York City Department of Correction|Department of Corrections]]. After the shooting, the Factory scene heavily increased security, and for many the &quot;Factory 60s&quot; ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;popism287-295&quot;/&gt;

Warhol had this to say about the attack: &quot;Before I was shot, I always thought that I was more half-there than all-there—I always suspected that I was watching TV instead of living life. People sometimes say that the way things happen in movies is unreal, but actually it's the way things happen in life that's unreal. The movies make emotions look so strong and real, whereas when things really do happen to you, it's like watching television—you don't feel anything. Right when I was being shot and ever since, I knew that I was watching television. The channels switch, but it's all television.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;StilesSelz1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kristine Stiles|author2=Peter Howard Selz|title=Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art: a Sourcebook of Artists' Writings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WXV-HlsUzdcC&amp;pg=PA345|accessdate=January 13, 2013|year=1996|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20251-1|pages=345–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to the success and scandal of Warhol's work in the 1960s, the 1970s were a much quieter decade, as he became more entrepreneurial. According to [[Bob Colacello]], Warhol devoted much of his time to rounding up new, rich patrons for portrait commissions—including Shah of Iran [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], his wife Empress [[Farah Pahlavi]], his sister [[Princess Ashraf Pahlavi]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[John Lennon]], [[Diana Ross]], [[Luigi Accame]], and [[Brigitte Bardot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8179627.stm |work=BBC News | title=Warhol's Jackson goes on display | date=August 7, 2009 | accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Warhol's famous portrait of Chinese Communist leader [[Mao Zedong]] was created in 1973. He also founded, with [[Gerard Malanga]], ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine, and published ''The Philosophy of Andy Warhol'' (1975). An idea expressed in the book: &quot;Making money is art, and working is art and good business is the best art.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Delves Broughton|first=Philip|title=The Art of the Sale|year=2012|publisher=The Penguin Press|location=New York, NY|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol socialized at various nightspots in New York City, including [[Max's Kansas City]]; and, later in the 1970s, [[Studio 54]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maxskansascity.com/warhol/ |title=Andy Warhol Biography: From The Velvet Underground To Basquiat |accessdate=January 6, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107015819/http://www.maxskansascity.com/warhol/ |archivedate=January 7, 2009 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was generally regarded as quiet, shy, and a meticulous observer.

With his longtime friend [[Stuart Pivar]], Warhol founded the [[New York Academy of Art]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYM 1992&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gOMCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA28 |title=New York Magazine Jan 27, 1992 |publisher= |date=January 27, 1992 |accessdate=December 4, 2013|author1=New York Media |first1=LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NOECAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA24 |title=New York Magazine Apr 8, 1996 |publisher= |date=April 8, 1996 |accessdate=December 4, 2013|author1=New York Media |first1=LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
Warhol had a re-emergence of critical and financial success in the 1980s, partially due to his affiliation and friendships with a number of prolific younger artists, who were dominating the &quot;[[bull market]]&quot; of 1980s New York art: [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Julian Schnabel]], [[David Salle]] and other so-called [[Neo-expressionism|Neo-Expressionists]], as well as members of the [[Transavantgarde]] movement in Europe, including [[Francesco Clemente]] and [[Enzo Cucchi]]. Before the 1984 [[Sarajevo]] [[Winter Olympics]], he teamed up with 15 other artists, including [[David Hockney]] and [[Cy Twombly]], and contributed a [[Speed Skater]] print to the Art and Sport collection. The Speed Skater was used for the official [[1984 Winter Olympics|Sarajevo Winter Olympics]] poster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aanddgallery.com/store/images/uploads/WarholWinterolympics.jpg|title=&quot;Speed Skater&quot; official 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics poster by Andy Warhol|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, [[graffiti]] artist [[Fab Five Freddy]] paid homage to Warhol when he painted an entire train with Campbell soup cans. This was instrumental in Freddy becoming involved in the underground NYC art scene and becoming an affiliate of Basquiat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hip Hop Family Tree|last=Piskor|first=Ed|publisher=Fantagraphics|year=2013|isbn=1606996908|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this period, Warhol was being criticized for becoming merely a &quot;business artist&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;jpost&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|first=Michal |last=Lando |date=April 8, 2008 |title=Reexamining Warhol's Jews |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1207486218796&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |accessdate=January 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703204535/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1207486218796&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |archivedate=July 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, reviewers disliked his exhibits of portraits of 1970s personalities and celebrities, calling them superficial, facile and commercial, with no depth or indication of the significance of the subjects. They also criticized his 1980 exhibit of 10 portraits at the [[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|Jewish Museum]] in Manhattan, entitled ''Jewish Geniuses'', which Warhol—who was uninterested in [[Judaism]] and Jews—had described in his diary as &quot;They're going to sell.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jpost&quot; /&gt; In hindsight, however, some critics have come to view Warhol's superficiality and commerciality as &quot;the most brilliant mirror of our times,&quot; contending that &quot;Warhol had captured something irresistible about the [[zeitgeist]] of American culture in the 1970s.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jpost&quot; /&gt;

Warhol also had an appreciation for intense [[Hollywood glamour]]. He once said: &quot;I love Los Angeles. I love Hollywood. They're so beautiful. Everything's plastic, but I love plastic. I want to be plastic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Victor |last1=Bockris |authorlink=Victor Bockris |author2=[[Gerard Malanga]] |title=Up-tight: the Velvet Underground story |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |location=London |year=2002 |page=66 |isbn=0-7119-9170-7 |oclc=49906101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol died in Manhattan at 6:32&amp;nbsp;a.m. on February 22, 1987. According to news reports, he had been making a good recovery from [[gallbladder]] surgery at [[New York Hospital]] before dying in his sleep from a sudden post-operative [[cardiac arrhythmia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DA1639F930A25757C0A961948260 |first=Robert O. |last=Boorstin |title=Hospital Asserts it Gave Warhol Adequate Care |date=April 13, 1987 |accessdate=January 2, 2009 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his diagnosis and operation, Warhol delayed having his recurring gallbladder problems checked, as he was afraid to enter hospitals and see doctors.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYM 1992&quot; /&gt; His family sued the hospital for inadequate care, saying that the arrhythmia was caused by improper care and [[water intoxication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sullivan |first=Ronald |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/05/nyregion/care-faulted-in-the-death-of-warhol.html |title=Care faulted in the death of warhol |work=The New York Times |date=December 5, 1991 |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The malpractice case was quickly settled out of court; Warhol's family received an undisclosed sum of money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-12-24/news/9112240841_1_warhol-york-hospital-gallstones |title=Andy Warhol Heirs Settle Lawsuit With Hospital Over Artist's Death| work= Orlando Sentinel |publisher= |date=December 24, 1991 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before Warhol's death, doctors expected Warhol to survive the surgery, though a revaluation of the case about thirty years after his death showed many indications that Warhol's surgery was in fact riskier than originally thought.&lt;ref name=&quot;death-nyt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=GOPNIK|first1=BLAKE|title=Warhol’s Death: Not So Simple, After All|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/21/arts/design/andy-warhols-death-not-so-routine-after-all.html?_r=0|website=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=February 22, 2017 | deadurl = No | archivedate = February 22, 2017 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2017%2F02%2F21%2Farts%2Fdesign%2Fandy-warhols-death-not-so-routine-after-all.html%3Faction%3Dclick%26contentCollection%3DU.S.%26module%3DTrending%26version%3DFull%26region%3DMarginalia%26pgtype%3Darticle&amp;date=2017-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was widely reported at the time that Warhol died of a &quot;routine&quot; surgery, though when considering factors such as his age, a [[Family history (medicine)|family history]] of gallbladder problems, his previous [[Ballistic trauma|gunshot wounds]], and his medical state in the weeks leading up to the procedure, the potential risk of death following the surgery appeared to have been significant.&lt;ref name=&quot;death-nyt&quot; /&gt;

Warhol's brothers took his body back to Pittsburgh, where an open-coffin [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] was held at the Thomas P. Kunsak Funeral Home. The solid bronze casket had gold-plated rails and white upholstery. Warhol was dressed in a black cashmere suit, a paisley tie, a platinum wig, and sunglasses. He was laid out holding a small prayer book and a red rose. The funeral liturgy was held at the [[Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church (Pittsburgh)|Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church]] on Pittsburgh's [[North Shore (Pittsburgh)|North Side]]. The eulogy was given by Monsignor Peter Tay. [[Yoko Ono]] and [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]] were speakers. The coffin was covered with white roses and [[Asparagus aethiopicus|asparagus ferns]]. After the liturgy, the coffin was driven to [[St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cemetery]] in [[Bethel Park, Pennsylvania|Bethel Park]], a south suburb of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.

At the grave, the priest said a brief prayer and sprinkled holy water on the casket. Before the coffin was lowered, Paige Powell dropped a copy of ''Interview'' magazine, an ''Interview'' T-shirt, and a bottle of the [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estee Lauder]] perfume &quot;Beautiful&quot; into the grave. Warhol was buried next to his mother and father. A memorial service was held in Manhattan for Warhol on April 1, 1987, at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York]].

==Foundation==

Warhol's will dictated that his entire estate—with the exception of a few modest legacies to family members—would go to create a foundation dedicated to the &quot;advancement of the visual arts&quot;. Warhol had so many possessions that it took [[Sotheby's]] nine days to auction his estate after his death; the auction grossed more than US$20&amp;nbsp;million.

In 1987, in accordance with Warhol's will, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts began. The foundation serves as the estate of Andy Warhol, but also has a mission &quot;to foster innovative artistic expression and the creative process&quot; and is &quot;focused primarily on supporting work of a challenging and often experimental nature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;warholfoundation intro&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warholfoundation.org/foundation/overview.html|title=Introduction |publisher=The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts |accessdate=January 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

===Paintings===
By the beginning of the 1960s, [[pop art]] was an experimental form that several artists were independently adopting; some of these pioneers, such as [[Roy Lichtenstein]], would later become synonymous with the movement. Warhol, who would become famous as the &quot;Pope of Pop&quot;, turned to this new style, where popular subjects could be part of the artist's palette. His early paintings show images taken from [[cartoons]] and advertisements, hand-painted with paint drips. Marilyn Monroe was a pop art painting that Warhol had done and it was very popular. Those drips emulated the style of successful abstract expressionists (such as [[Willem de Kooning]]). Warhol's first pop art paintings were displayed in April 1961, serving as the backdrop for New York Department Store Bronwit Teller's window display. This was the same stage his Pop Art contemporaries [[Jasper Johns]], [[James Rosenquist]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]] had also once graced.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Patrick S (1986). ''Andy Warhol's Art and Films''; UMI Research Press; p.98; {{ISBN|0-8357-1733-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the gallerist Muriel Latow who came up with the ideas for both the soup cans and Warhol's dollar paintings. On November 23, 1961, Warhol wrote Latow a check for $50 which, according to the 2009 Warhol biography, ''Pop, The Genius of Warhol'', was payment for coming up with the idea of the soup cans as subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warholstars.org/art/warhol/soup.html |title=The Soup Cans—Andy Warhol |publisher=Warholstars.org |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801234441/http://www.warholstars.org/art/warhol/soup.html |archivedate=August 1, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; For his first major exhibition, Warhol painted his famous cans of Campbell's soup, which he claimed to have had for lunch for most of his life. A 1964 ''Large Campbell’s Soup Can'' was sold in a 2007 [[Sotheby's]] auction to a South American collector  for £5.1 million ($7.4 million).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://news.artnet.com/market/sothebys-100-million-contemporary-art-evening-sale-422258 Early Lucian Freud Painting Leads Sotheby’s $100 Million Contemporary Art Evening Sale]&quot; by Colin Gleadell, ''[[Artnet]]'', February 10, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

He loved [[celebrity|celebrities]], so he painted them as well. From these beginnings he developed his later style and subjects. Instead of working on a signature subject matter, as he started out to do, he worked more and more on a signature style, slowly eliminating the handmade from the artistic process. Warhol frequently used [[silk-screen]]ing; his later drawings were traced from slide projections. At the height of his fame as a painter, Warhol had several assistants who produced his silk-screen multiples, following his directions to make different versions and variations.&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Warhol was commissioned by BMW to paint a Group-4 race version of the then &quot;elite supercar&quot; [[BMW M1]] for the fourth installment in the [[BMW Art Car Project]]. It was reported at the time that, unlike the three artists before him, Warhol opted to paint directly onto the automobile himself instead of letting technicians transfer his scale-model design to the car.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060525054033/http://www.carbodydesign.com/archive/2006/03/27-bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1/Andy-Warhol-lg.jpg Bmw Art Car 1979: M1 by Andy Warhol], ''Car Body Design'', March 27, 2006 (archived)&lt;/ref&gt; It was indicated that Warhol spent only a total of 23 minutes to paint the entire car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbodydesign.com/archive/2006/03/27-bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1/bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213000309/http://www.carbodydesign.com/archive/2006/03/27-bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1/bmw-art-car-1979-andy-warhol-m1.php |archivedate=February 13, 2010 |title=Bmw Art Car 1979: M1 by Andy Warhol |publisher=carbodydesign.com |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol produced both comic and serious works; his subject could be a soup can or an electric chair. Warhol used the same techniques—silkscreens, reproduced serially, and often painted with bright colors—whether he painted celebrities, everyday objects, or images of suicide, car crashes, and disasters, as in the 1962–63 ''Death and Disaster'' series. The ''Death and Disaster'' paintings included ''Red Car Crash'', ''Purple Jumping Man'', and ''Orange Disaster.'' One of these paintings, the diptych ''Silver Car Crash'', became the highest priced work of his when it sold at Sotheby's Contemporary Art Auction on Wednesday, November 13, 2013, for $105.4 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;sothebys.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Sotheby's – November 14, 2013 |url=http://www.sothebys.com/content/sothebys/en/news-video/blogs/all-blogs/contemporary/2013/11/record-warhol-leads-.html |title=Record Warhol Leads Contemporary Sale &amp;#124; Sotheby's |publisher=Sothebys.com |date=November 14, 2013 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Warhol's work, as well as his own personality, has been described as being [[Buster Keaton|Keatonesque]]. Warhol has been described as playing dumb to the media. He sometimes refused to explain his work. He has suggested that all one needs to know about his work is &quot;already there 'on the surface'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artexpertswebsite.com/pages/artists/warhol.php |title=Andy Warhol Biography (1928–1987) |publisher=Art Experts |accessdate=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[Rorschach test|Rorschach inkblots]] are intended as pop comments on art and what art could be. His cow wallpaper (literally, wallpaper with a cow [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]) and his [[redox|oxidation]] paintings (canvases prepared with copper paint that was then oxidized with urine) are also noteworthy in this context. Equally noteworthy is the way these works—and their [[means of production]]—mirrored the atmosphere at Andy's New York &quot;Factory&quot;. Biographer Bob Colacello provides some details on Andy's &quot;piss paintings&quot;:

{{quote|Victor&amp;nbsp;... was Andy's ghost pisser on the Oxidations. He would come to the Factory to urinate on canvases that had already been primed with copper-based paint by Andy or Ronnie Cutrone, a second ghost pisser much appreciated by Andy, who said that the vitamin B that Ronnie took made a prettier color when the acid in the urine turned the copper green. Did Andy ever use his own urine? My diary shows that when he first began the series, in December 1977, he did, and there were many others: boys who'd come to lunch and drink too much wine, and find it funny or even flattering to be asked to help Andy 'paint'. Andy always had a little extra bounce in his walk as he led them to his studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Bob |last=Colacello |authorlink=Bob Colacello |title=Holy terror: Andy Warhol close up |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |year=1990 |page=343 |isbn=0-06-016419-0 |oclc=21196706}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Warhol's first portrait of ''Basquiat'' (1982) is a black photo-silkscreen over an oxidized copper &quot;piss painting&quot;.

After many years of silkscreen, oxidation, photography, etc., Warhol returned to painting with a brush in hand in a series of more than 50 large collaborative works done with [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]] between 1984 and 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Chiappini, Rudi (ed.), ''Jean-Michel Basquiat''.

Andy Warhol was commissioned in 1984 by collector and gallerist [[Alexander Iolas]] to produce work based on [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' for an exhibition at the old refectory of the Palazzo delle Stelline in [[Milan]], opposite from the [[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)|Santa Maria delle Grazie]] where Leonardo da Vinci's mural can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Schmuckli, [http://pastexhibitions.guggenheim.org/warhol/ &quot;Andy Warhol: The Last Supper&quot; (June 1999 – December 2001)] [[Guggenheim Museum SoHo]].

Artist [[Maurizio Cattelan]] describes that it is difficult to separate daily encounters from the art of Andy Warhol: &quot;That's probably the greatest thing about Warhol: the way he penetrated and summarized our world, to the point that distinguishing between him and our everyday life is basically impossible, and in any case useless.&quot; Warhol was an inspiration towards Cattelan's magazine and photography compilations, such as ''Permanent Food, Charley'', and ''Toilet Paper''.&lt;ref&gt;Spector, Nancy. ''Maurizio Cattelan: All''. New York, NY: Guggenheim Museum Publications, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period just before his death, Warhol was working on ''[[Cars (painting)|Cars]]'', a series of paintings for [[Mercedes-Benz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/sep/01/arts.warhol|title=Warhol: Cars|date=September 1, 2001|accessdate=April 24, 2010|work=The Guardian |location=London | first=Maev | last=Kennedy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A self-portrait by Andy Warhol (1963–64), which sold in New York at the May Post-War and Contemporary evening sale in [[Christie's]], fetched $38.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13371502|title=Andy Warhol self-portrait fetches $38.4m|date=May 12, 2011|newspaper=BBC News|access-date=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, 2012, his classic painting ''Double Elvis (Ferus Type)'' sold at auction at [[Sotheby's]] in New York for US$33 million. With commission, the sale price totaled US$37,042,500, short of the $50 million that Sotheby's had predicted the painting might bring. The piece (silkscreen ink and [[spray paint]] on canvas) shows [[Elvis Presley]] in a [[gunslinger]] pose. It was first exhibited in 1963 at the [[Ferus Gallery]] in [[Los Angeles]]. Warhol made 22 versions of the ''Double Elvis'', nine of which are held in museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=AP|title=Warhol 'Elvis' sells for $37M; Lichtenstein, Weiwei works break own records at NYC auction|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/warhol-elvis-sells-for-37m-lichtenstein-weiwei-works-break-own-records-at-nyc-auction/2012/05/09/gIQAQQKDEU_story.html|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=May 10, 2012}}{{Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Films===
Warhol worked across a wide range of media—painting, photography, drawing, and sculpture. In addition, he was a highly prolific filmmaker. Between 1963 and 1968, he made more than 60 films,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0912238/|title=Andy Warhol Filmography|work=The Internet Movie Database|accessdate=September 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus some 500 short black-and-white &quot;[[Screen Tests|screen test]]&quot; portraits of Factory visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffner (1999), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his most famous films, ''[[Sleep (film)|Sleep]]'', monitors poet [[John Giorno]] sleeping for six hours. The 35-minute film ''[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]]'' is one continuous shot of the face of [[DeVeren Bookwalter]] supposedly receiving [[oral sex]] from filmmaker [[Willard Maas]], although the camera never tilts down to see this. Another, ''[[Empire (1964 film)|Empire]]'' (1964), consists of eight hours of footage of the [[Empire State Building]] in New York City at dusk. The film ''[[Eat (film)|Eat]]'' consists of a man eating a mushroom for 45 minutes. Warhol attended the 1962 premiere of the static composition by [[LaMonte Young]] called ''Trio for Strings'' and subsequently created his famous series of static films including ''Kiss'', ''Eat'', and ''Sleep'' (for which Young initially was commissioned to provide music). Uwe Husslein cites filmmaker [[Jonas Mekas]], who accompanied Warhol to the Trio premiere, and who claims Warhol's static films were directly inspired by the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Uwe |last=Husslein |title=Pop goes art: Andy Warhol &amp; Velvet Underground |publisher=Wuppertal |year=1990 |oclc=165575494}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Batman Dracula]]'' is a 1964 film that was produced and directed by Warhol, without the permission of [[DC Comics]]. It was screened only at his art exhibits. A fan of the ''Batman''  series, Warhol's movie was an &quot;homage&quot; to the series, and is considered the first appearance of a blatantly [[Camp (style)|campy]] Batman. The film was until recently thought to have been lost, until scenes from the picture were shown at some length in the 2006 documentary ''[[Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis]]''.

Warhol's 1965 film ''[[Vinyl (1965 film)|Vinyl]]'' is an adaptation of [[Anthony Burgess]]' popular [[dystopia]]n novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. Others record improvised encounters between Factory regulars such as [[Brigid Berlin]], [[Viva (actress)|Viva]], [[Edie Sedgwick]], [[Candy Darling]], [[Holly Woodlawn]], [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]], [[Nico]], and [[Jackie Curtis]]. Legendary underground artist [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]] appears in the film ''Camp''.

His most popular and critically successful film was ''[[Chelsea Girls]]'' (1966). The film was highly innovative in that it consisted of two [[16 mm film|16 mm]]-films being projected simultaneously, with two different stories being shown in tandem. From the projection booth, the sound would be raised for one film to elucidate that &quot;story&quot; while it was lowered for the other. The multiplication of images evoked Warhol's seminal silk-screen works of the early 1960s.

Other important films include ''[[Bike Boy]]'', ''My Hustler'', ''[[The Nude Restaurant]]'', and ''[[Lonesome Cowboys (1968 film)|Lonesome Cowboys]]'', a raunchy pseudo-[[Western (genre)|western]]. These and other titles document gay underground and camp culture, and continue to feature prominently in scholarship about sexuality and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Matthew |last=Tinkcom |title=Working like a homosexual: camp, capital, and cinema |publisher=[[Duke University Press]] |location=Durham, North Carolina |year=2002 |isbn=0-8223-2862-3 |oclc=48098591}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Juan Antonio |last=Suárez |title=Bike boys, drag queens &amp; superstars: avant-garde, mass culture, and gay identities in the 1960s underground cinema |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |location=Bloomington, Indiana |year=1996 |isbn=0-253-32971-X |oclc=32548890}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warhol was a fan of filmmaker [[Radley Metzger]]{{'s}} film work&lt;ref name=&quot;FD-20140807&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Hudson |first=David |title= This Is Softcore: The Art Cinema Erotica of Radley Metzger |url=https://www.fandor.com/keyframe/daily-this-is-softcore-the-art-cinema-erotica-of-radley-metzger |date=August 7, 2014 |work=[[Fandor (film site)|Fandor]] |accessdate=February 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and commented that Metzger's film, ''[[The Lickerish Quartet]]'', was &quot;an outrageously kinky masterpiece&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20170404&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Sandmir |first=Richard |title=Radley Metzger, Whose Artful Erotica Turned Explicit, Dies at 88 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/movies/radley-metzger-director-who-left-erotica-for-hard-core-dies-at-88.html |date=April 4, 2017 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=April 5, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TRR-20170402&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Metzger |first1=Juliette |last2=Feldman |first2=Caryl |last3=West |first3=Ashley |title=Press Release: Radley Metzger, pioneering filmmaker, dies at 88 |url=http://www.therialtoreport.com/2017/04/02/radley-metzger-2/ |date=April 2, 2017 |work=[[The Rialto Report]] |accessdate=April 2, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FSLC-AndyWarhol&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff |title=''The Lickerish Quartet''|url=http://www.filmlinc.com/films/on-sale/the-lickerish-quartet |date=August 8, 2014|work=[[Film Society of Lincoln Center]]|accessdate=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Blue Movie]]''—a film in which Warhol superstar [[Viva (actress)|Viva]] makes love in bed with [[Louis Waldon]], another Warhol superstar—was Warhol's last film as director.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-19690722&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Movie Review – Blue Movie (1968) Screen: Andy Warhol's 'Blue Movie' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9507E5D91738E63ABC4A51DFB1668382679EDE |date=July 22, 1969 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=December 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-19690810&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Warhol's Red Hot and 'Blue' Movie.

After his June 3, 1968, shooting, a reclusive Warhol relinquished his personal involvement in filmmaking. His acolyte and assistant director, [[Paul Morrissey]], took over the film-making chores for [[the Factory]] collective, steering Warhol-branded cinema towards more mainstream, narrative-based, B-movie [[exploitation film|exploitation]] fare with ''[[Flesh (1968 film)|Flesh]]'', ''[[Trash (1970 film)|Trash]]'', and ''[[Heat (1972 film)|Heat]]''. All of these films, including the later ''[[Blood for Dracula|Andy Warhol's Dracula]]'' and ''[[Flesh for Frankenstein|Andy Warhol's Frankenstein]]'', were far more mainstream than anything Warhol as a director had attempted. These latter &quot;Warhol&quot; films starred [[Joe Dallesandro]]—more of a Morrissey star than a true [[Warhol superstar]].

In the early 1970s, most of the films directed by Warhol were pulled out of circulation by Warhol and the people around him who ran his business. After Warhol's death, the films were slowly restored by the Whitney Museum and are occasionally projected at museums and film festivals. Few of the Warhol-directed films are available on video or DVD.

===Music===
In the mid-1960s, Warhol adopted the band [[the Velvet Underground]], making them a crucial element of the [[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]] multimedia performance art show. Warhol, with [[Paul Morrissey]], acted as the band's manager, introducing them to [[Nico]] (who would perform with the band at Warhol's request). In 1966 he &quot;produced&quot; their first album ''[[The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico]]'', as well as providing its album art. His actual participation in the album's production amounted to simply paying for the studio time. After the band's first album, Warhol and band leader [[Lou Reed]] started to disagree more about the direction the band should take, and their artistic friendship ended.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In 1989, after Warhol's death, Reed and [[John Cale]] re-united for the first time since 1972 to write, perform, record and release the concept album ''[[Songs for Drella]]'', a tribute to Warhol.

Warhol designed many album covers for various artists starting with the photographic cover of [[John Wallowitch]]'s debut album, ''This Is John Wallowitch!!!'' (1964). He designed the cover art for [[The Rolling Stones]]' albums ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971) and ''[[Love You Live]]'' (1977), and the [[John Cale]] albums ''[[The Academy in Peril]]'' (1972) and ''[[Honi Soit (album)|Honi Soit]]'' in 1981. One of Warhol's last works was a portrait of [[Aretha Franklin]] for the cover of her 1986 [[Music recording sales certification|gold album]] ''[[Aretha (1986 album)|Aretha]]'', which was done in the style of the ''Reigning Queens'' series he had completed the year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bego | first = Mark |title =Aretha Franklin: The Queen of Soul |publisher=Da Capo Press |year = 2001 | page = 250 |isbn = 0-306-80935-4 |oclc = 46488152 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=ErKigdCXUwoC&amp;pg=PA250&amp;lpg=PA250&amp;dq=warhol+album+cover+1986 | accessdate=March 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol strongly influenced the [[New wave music|new wave]]/[[punk rock]] band [[Devo]], as well as [[David Bowie]]. Bowie recorded a song called &quot;[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]&quot; for his 1971 album ''[[Hunky Dory]]''. Lou Reed wrote the song &quot;Andy's Chest&quot;, about [[Valerie Solanas]], the woman who shot Warhol, in 1968. He recorded it with the Velvet Underground, and this version was released on the ''[[VU (album)|VU]]'' album in 1985. Bowie would later play Warhol in the 1996 movie, ''[[Basquiat (film)|Basquiat]]''. Bowie recalled how meeting Warhol in real life helped him in the role, and recounted his early meetings with him:
{{quote|I met him a couple of times, but we seldom shared more than platitudes. The first time we saw each other an awkward silence fell till he remarked my bright yellow shoes and started talking enthusiastically. He wanted to be very superficial. And seemingly emotionless, indifferent, just like a dead fish. Lou Reed described him most profoundly when he once told me they should bring a doll of Andy on the market: a doll that you wind up and doesn't do anything. But I managed to observe him well, and that was a helping hand for the film ''[Basquiat'']. … We borrowed his clothes from the museum in Pittsburgh, and they were intact, unwashed. Even the pockets weren't emptied: they contained pancake, white, deadly pale ''{{abbr|fond de teint|foundation}}'' which Andy always smeared on his face, a check torn in pieces, someone's address, lots of homeopathic pills and a wig. Andy always wore those silver wigs, but he never admitted it were wigs. One of his hairdressers has told me lately that he had his wigs regularly cut, like it were real hair. When the wig was trimmed, he put on another next month as if his hair had grown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.algonet.se/~bassman/articles/95/h.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130616041825/http://www.algonet.se/~bassman/articles/95/h.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 16, 2013 |title=Can the Real David Bowie Rise, Please? |journal=''[[HUMO]]'' magazine |date=December 5, 1995 |accessdate=June 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Books and print===
Beginning in the early 1950s, Warhol produced several unbound portfolios of his work.

The first of several bound self-published books by Warhol was ''[[25 Cats Name Sam and One Blue Pussy]]'', printed in 1954 by Seymour Berlin on Arches brand watermarked paper using his blotted line technique for the lithographs. The original edition was limited to 190 numbered, hand colored copies, using Dr. Martin's ink washes. Most of these were given by Warhol as gifts to clients and friends. Copy No. 4, inscribed &quot;Jerry&quot; on the front cover and given to [[Geraldine Stutz]], was used for a facsimile printing in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John |last=Russell |authorlink=John Russell (art critic) |date=December 6, 1987 |title=Art |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DF133DF935A35751C1A961948260 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=January 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the original was auctioned in May 2006 for US $35,000 by [[Doyle New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doylenewyork.com/default.htm May 3, 2006, auction at Doyle New York]. Retrieved August 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other self-published books by Warhol include:
* ''A Gold Book''
* ''Wild Raspberries''
* ''Holy Cats''

Warhol's book ''A La Recherche du Shoe Perdu'' (1955) marked his &quot;transition from commercial to gallery artist&quot;.&lt;ref name=SmithAllaraWarhol2002&gt;Smith, John W., Pamela Allara, and Andy Warhol. ''Possession Obsession: Andy Warhol and Collecting''. Pittsburgh, PA: Andy Warhol Museum, 2002, p. 46. {{ISBN|0-9715688-0-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (The title is a [[wordplay|play on words]] by Warhol on the title of French author [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[À la recherche du temps perdu]]''.)&lt;ref name=SmithAllaraWarhol2002/&gt;

After gaining fame, Warhol &quot;wrote&quot; several books that were commercially published:
* ''[[A, a novel|a, A Novel]]'' (1968, {{ISBN|0-8021-3553-6}}) is a literal transcription—containing spelling errors and phonetically written background noise and mumbling—of audio recordings of [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]] and several of Andy Warhol's friends hanging out at the Factory, talking, going out.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* ''[[The Philosophy of Andy Warhol]] (From A to B &amp; Back Again)'' (1975, {{ISBN|0-15-671720-4}})—according to Pat Hackett's introduction to ''The Andy Warhol Diaries'', Pat Hackett did the transcriptions and text for the book based on daily phone conversations, sometimes (when Warhol was traveling) using audio cassettes that Andy Warhol gave her. Said cassettes contained conversations with [[Brigid Berlin]] (also known as Brigid Polk) and former ''Interview'' magazine editor [[Bob Colacello]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* ''[[Popism: The Warhol Sixties]]'' (1980, {{ISBN|0-15-672960-1}}), authored by Warhol and Pat Hackett, is a retrospective view of the 1960s and the role of pop art.
* ''[[The Andy Warhol Diaries]]'' (1989, {{ISBN|0-446-39138-7}}), edited by Pat Hackett, is a diary dictated by Warhol to Hackett in daily phone conversations. Warhol started the diary to keep track of his expenses after being audited, although it soon evolved to include his personal and cultural observations.&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol created the fashion magazine ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' that is still published today. The loopy title script on the cover is thought to be either his own handwriting or that of his mother, Julia Warhola, who would often do text work for his early commercial pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Colacello, Bob (1990), pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other media===
Although Andy Warhol is most known for his paintings and films, he authored works in many different media.
* '''Drawing:''' Warhol started his career as a commercial illustrator, producing drawings in &quot;blotted-ink&quot; style for advertisements and magazine articles. Best known of these early works are his drawings of shoes. Some of his personal drawings were self-published in small booklets, such as ''Yum, Yum, Yum'' (about food), ''Ho, Ho, Ho'' (about Christmas) and (of course) ''Shoes, Shoes, Shoes''. His most artistically acclaimed book of drawings is probably ''A Gold Book'', compiled of sensitive drawings of young men. ''A Gold Book'' is so named because of the [[gold leaf]] that decorates its pages.&lt;ref name=Bourdon51&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdon |first=David |title=Warhol |publisher=Harry N.

The image was said to have been drawn when Andy was nine or 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-17591826 |title='Andy Warhol sketch found' in US garage sale |date=April 2, 2012 |accessdate=April 3, 2012 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various authorities have challenged the image's authenticity.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}
[[File:Silver Clouds Warhol Musee dArt Moderne ville Paris.jpg|thumb|''Silver Clouds'' Reproduction at the [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]], December 2015, Warhol Unlimited Exposition]]
* '''Sculpture:''' Warhol's most famous sculpture is probably his ''Brillo Boxes'', silkscreened ink on wood replicas of the large, branded cardboard boxes used to hold 24 packages of [[Brillo]] soap pads. The original Brillo design was by commercial artist [[James Harvey (artist)|James Harvey]]. Warhol's sculpture was part of a series of &quot;grocery carton&quot; works that also included Heinz ketchup and Campbell's tomato juice cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;365 Takes&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Staff of The Andy Warhol Museum |title=Andy Warhol: 365 Takes |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |location=New York |year=2004 |page=35 |isbn=0-500-23814-6 |oclc=56117613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other famous works include the ''Silver Clouds''—helium filled, silver mylar, pillow-shaped [[balloon]]s. A ''Silver Cloud'' was included in the traveling exhibition ''Air Art'' (1968–1969) curated by [[Willoughby Sharp]]. ''Clouds'' was also adapted by Warhol for [[avant-garde]] choreographer Merce Cunningham's dance piece ''RainForest'' (1968).&lt;ref name=Bourdon231&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdon |first=David |title=Warhol |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |location=New York |year=1989 |page=231 |isbn=0-8109-1761-0 |oclc=19389231}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Audio:''' At one point Warhol carried a portable recorder with him wherever he went, taping everything everybody said and did. He referred to this device as his &quot;wife&quot;. Some of these tapes were the basis for his literary work. Another audio-work of Warhol's was his ''Invisible Sculpture'', a presentation in which burglar alarms would go off when entering the room. Warhol's cooperation with the musicians of The Velvet Underground was driven by an expressed desire to become a music producer.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* '''Time Capsules:''' In 1973, Warhol began saving ephemera from his daily life—correspondence, newspapers, souvenirs, childhood objects, even used plane tickets and food—which was sealed in plain cardboard boxes dubbed Time Capsules. By the time of his death, the collection grew to include 600, individually dated &quot;capsules&quot;. The boxes are now housed at the Andy Warhol Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Staff of The Andy Warhol Museum |title=Andy Warhol: 365 Takes |publisher=Harry N.

* '''Television:''' Andy Warhol dreamed of a [[television special]] about a favorite subject of his{{dash}}[[Nothing]]{{dash}}that he would call ''The Nothing Special''. Later in his career he did create two cable television shows, ''Andy Warhol's TV'' in 1982 and ''[[Andy Warhol's Fifteen Minutes]]'' (based on his famous &quot;[[fifteen minutes of fame]]&quot; quotation) for MTV in 1986. Besides his own shows he regularly made guest appearances on other programs, including ''[[The Love Boat]]'' wherein a Midwestern wife ([[Marion Ross]]) fears Andy Warhol will reveal to her husband ([[Tom Bosley]], who starred alongside Ross in sitcom ''[[Happy Days]]'') her secret past as a Warhol superstar named Marina del Rey. Warhol also produced a TV commercial for [[Schrafft's]] Restaurants in New York City, for an ice cream dessert appropriately titled the &quot;Underground Sundae&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joedallesandro.com/sundae.htm |title=Underground Sundae |year=2005 |first=Michael |last=Ferguson |accessdate=January 6, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116182237/http://www.joedallesandro.com/sundae.htm |archivedate=January 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol's work in fashion includes silkscreened dresses, a short sub-career as a catwalk-model and books on fashion as well as paintings with fashion (shoes) as a subject.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Warhol himself has been described as a modern [[dandy]], whose authority &quot;rested more on presence than on words&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Walden]], ''Who's a Dandy?—Dandyism and Beau Brummell'', London: Gibson Square, 2002. {{ISBN|1-903933-18-8}}.

* '''Performance Art:''' Warhol and his friends staged theatrical multimedia happenings at parties and public venues, combining music, film, slide projections and even Gerard Malanga in an [[Sadomasochism|S&amp;M]] outfit cracking a whip. The [[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]] in 1966 was the culmination of this area of his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bourdon221-225&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdon |first=David |title=Warhol |publisher=Harry N.

* '''Theater:''' Andy Warhol's ''Pork'' opened on May 5, 1971, at LaMama theater in New York for a two-week run and was brought to the Roundhouse in London for a longer run in August 1971. ''Pork'' was based on tape-recorded conversations between Brigid Berlin and Andy during which Brigid would play for Andy tapes she had made of phone conversations between herself and her mother, socialite Honey Berlin. The play featured [[Jayne County]] as &quot;Vulva&quot; and [[Cherry Vanilla]] as &quot;Amanda Pork&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Andy Warhol Museum|url=http://www.warhol.org/responsive/event.aspx?id=2215|accessdate=January 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Andy Warhol also produced the stage musical ''[[Man on the Moon (musical)|Man on the Moon]]'', which was written by [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]] of the [[Mamas and the Papas]].
* '''Photography:''' To produce his silkscreens, Warhol made photographs or had them made by his friends and assistants. These pictures were mostly taken with a specific model of [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] camera that Polaroid kept in production especially for Warhol. This photographic approach to painting and his snapshot method of taking pictures has had a great effect on artistic photography. Warhol was an accomplished photographer, and took an enormous amount of photographs of Factory visitors, friends.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* '''Computer:''' Warhol used [[Amiga]] computers to generate digital art, including ''[[You Are the One (Andy Warhol)|You Are the One]]'', which he helped design and build with Amiga, Inc. He also displayed the difference between slow fill and fast fill on live TV with [[Debbie Harry]] as a model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nowseethis.org/invisiblephoto/posts/108 |title=Andy Warhol's Amiga Experiments |year=2014 |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oqUd8utr14 video])

===Producer and product===
Warhol had assistance in producing his paintings. This is also true of his film-making and commercial enterprises.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

He founded the gossip magazine ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'', a stage for celebrities he &quot;endorsed&quot; and a business staffed by his friends. He collaborated with others on all of his books (some of which were written with Pat Hackett.) He adopted the young painter [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], and the band [[The Velvet Underground]], presenting them to the public as his latest interest, and collaborating with them. One might even say that he produced people (as in the Warholian &quot;Superstar&quot; and the Warholian portrait). He endorsed products, appeared in commercials, and made frequent celebrity guest appearances on television shows and in films (he appeared in everything from ''[[Love Boat]]'' to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and the [[Richard Pryor]] movie ''Dynamite Chicken'').{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In this respect Warhol was a fan of &quot;Art Business&quot; and &quot;Business Art&quot;—he, in fact, wrote about his interest in thinking about art as business in ''The Philosophy of Andy Warhol from A to B and Back Again''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/903973784|title=The philosophy of Andy Warhol : (from A to B and back again)|last=1928-1987,|first=Warhol, Andy,|isbn=9780547543437|oclc=903973784}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that Warhol's homosexuality influenced his work and shaped his relationship to the art world is a major subject of scholarship on the artist and is an issue that Warhol himself addressed in interviews, in conversation with his contemporaries, and in his publications (''e.g.'', ''Popism: The Warhol 1960s''). Throughout his career, Warhol produced erotic photography and drawings of male nudes. Many of his most famous works (portraits of [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Judy Garland]], and [[Elizabeth Taylor]], and films such as ''[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]]'', ''My Hustler'' and ''[[Lonesome Cowboys (1968 film)|Lonesome Cowboys]]'') draw from gay underground culture or openly explore the complexity of sexuality and desire. As has been addressed by a range of scholars, many of his films premiered in gay porn theaters.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Waugh, ''Hard to Imagine: Gay Male eroticism in Photography and Film from the Beginnings to Stonewall'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first works that Warhol submitted to a fine art gallery, homoerotic drawings of male nudes, were rejected for being too openly gay.&lt;ref name=lobel1996&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Michael |last=Lobel |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0425/is_n4_v55/ai_19101783 |title=Warhol's closet—Andy Warhol—We're Here: Gay and Lesbian Presence in Art and Art History |journal=[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]] Winter 1966 |accessdate=January 5, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115214807/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0425/is_n4_v55/ai_19101783 |archivedate=January 15, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Popism'', furthermore, the artist recalls a conversation with the film maker [[Emile de Antonio]] about the difficulty Warhol had being accepted socially by the then-more-famous (but [[closeted]]) gay artists [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. De Antonio explained that Warhol was &quot;too swish and that upsets them.&quot; In response to this, Warhol writes, &quot;There was nothing I could say to that. It was all too true. So I decided I just wasn't going to care, because those were all the things that I didn't want to change anyway, that I didn't think I 'should' want to change&amp;nbsp;...

Some have suggested that his frequent refusal to comment on his work, to speak about himself (confining himself in interviews to responses like &quot;Um, no&quot; and &quot;Um, yes&quot;, and often allowing others to speak for him)—and even the evolution of his pop style—can be traced to the years when Warhol was first dismissed by the inner circles of the New York art world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fairbrother&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fairbrother |first=Trevor |chapter=Tomorrow's Man |title=Success Is a Job in New York: the Early Art and Business of Andy Warhol |editor=Donna De Salvo |location=New York |publisher=Grey Art Gallery and Study Center |year=1989 |pages=55–74 |isbn=0-934349-05-3 |oclc=19826995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious beliefs===
[[File:WarholLastSup.gif|thumb|300px|Images of Jesus from ''The [[Last Supper]]'' cycle (1986). Warhol made almost 100 variations on the theme, which the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim]] felt &quot;indicates an almost obsessive investment in the subject matter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Claudia |last=Schmuckli |url=http://pastexhibitions.guggenheim.org/warhol/ |title=Andy Warhol: The Last Supper |publisher=[[Solomon R.

Warhol was a practicing [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian Catholic]]. He regularly volunteered at [[homeless shelter]]s in New York City, particularly during the busier times of the year, and described himself as a religious person.&lt;ref name=&quot;godspy-Warhol&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|first=James |last=Romaine |date=November 12, 2003 |title=Transubstantiating the Culture: Andy Warhol's Secret |url=http://oldarchive.godspy.com/culture/Andy-Warhol-Transubstantiating-the-Culture.cfm.html |journal=[[Godspy]] |accessdate=January 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Warhol's later works depicted religious subjects, including two series, ''Details of Renaissance Paintings'' (1984) and ''The Last Supper'' (1986). In addition, a body of religious-themed works was found posthumously in his estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;godspy-Warhol&quot;/&gt;

During his life, Warhol regularly attended [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and the priest at Warhol's church, [[Church of St. Vincent Ferrer (New York)|Saint Vincent Ferrer]], said that the artist went there almost daily,&lt;ref name=&quot;godspy-Warhol&quot;/&gt; although he was not observed taking [[Eucharist#Catholic|Communion]] or going to [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Confession]] and sat or knelt in the pews at the back.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warhol at SVFC&quot;/&gt; The priest thought he was afraid of being recognized; Warhol said he was self-conscious about being seen in a [[Roman Rite]] church [[sign of the Cross|crossing himself]] &quot;in the [[Byzantine Rite|Orthodox]] way&quot; (right to left instead of the reverse).&lt;ref name=&quot;Warhol at SVFC&quot;/&gt;

His art is noticeably influenced by the [[Eastern Christian]] tradition which was so evident in his places of worship.&lt;ref name=&quot;godspy-Warhol&quot;/&gt;

Warhol's brother has described the artist as &quot;really religious, but he didn't want people to know about that because [it was] private&quot;. Despite the private nature of his faith, in Warhol's [[eulogy]] [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]] depicted it as devout: &quot;To my certain knowledge, he was responsible for at least one [[Conversion to Christianity|conversion]]. He took considerable pride in financing his nephew's studies for the priesthood&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;godspy-Warhol&quot;/&gt;

===Collections===
Warhol was an avid collector. His friends referred to his numerous collections, which filled not only his four-story [[townhouse]], but also a nearby storage unit, as &quot;Andy's Stuff.&quot; The true extent of his collections was not discovered until after his death, when the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh took in 641 boxes of his &quot;Stuff.&quot;

Warhol's collections included airplane menus, unpaid invoices, pizza dough, pornographic pulp novels, newspapers, stamps, supermarket flyers, and cookie jars, among other eccentricities. It also included significant works of art, such as [[George Bellows]]'s ''[[Miss Bentham]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barber.org.uk/american-acquisition-barber/ |title=American Acquisition |publisher=Barber Institute of Fine Arts |accessdate=February 16, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217000620/http://barber.org.uk/american-acquisition-barber/ |archivedate=February 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his main collections was his [[wig]]s. Warhol owned more than 40 and felt very protective of his hairpieces, which were sewn by a New York wig-maker from hair imported from Italy. In 1985 a girl snatched Warhol's wig off his head. It was later discovered in Warhol's diary entry for that day that he wrote: &quot;I don't know what held me back from pushing her over the balcony.&quot;

Another item found in Warhol's boxes at the museum in Pittsburgh was a [[mummy|mummified]] human foot from [[Ancient Egypt]]. The curator of anthropology at [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]] felt that Warhol most likely found it at a flea market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inktank.fi/the-5-most-unusual-habits-of-andy-warhol/ |title=The 5 most unusual habits of Andy Warhol |publisher=Inktank.fi |date=November 20, 2012 |accessdate=January 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[Men in Black 3]]'' (2012) Andy Warhol turns out to really be undercover MIB Agent W (played by [[Bill Hader]]). Warhol is throwing a party at The Factory in 1969, where he is looked up by MIB Agents K and J (J from the future). Agent W is desperate to end his undercover job (&quot;I'm so out of ideas I'm painting soup cans and bananas, for Christ sakes!&quot; and &quot;You gotta fake my death, okay? I can't listen to sitar music anymore.&quot;)

Andy Warhol (portrayed by [[Tom Meeten]]) is one of main characters of the 2012 British television show ''[[Noel Fielding's Luxury Comedy]]''. The character is portrayed as having robot-like mannerisms.

[[Gus Van Sant]] was planning a version of Warhol's life with [[River Phoenix]] in the lead role just before Phoenix's death in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gus Van |last=Sant |authorlink=Gus Van Sant |title=My Own Private Idaho |publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] |location=London |year=2000 |isbn=0-571-20259-4 |oclc=247737051 |origyear=1987}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
