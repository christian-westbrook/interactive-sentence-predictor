'''NYSE American''', formerly known as the '''American Stock Exchange''' ('''AMEX'''), and more recently as '''NYSE MKT''', is an American [[stock exchange]] situated in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. AMEX was previously a [[mutual organization]], owned by its members. Until 1953, it was known as the '''New York Curb Exchange'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klein|first=Maury|title=Rainbow's End: The Crash of 1929| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-513516-4|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===The Curb market===
{{see also|Curbstone broker}}
[[File:Curb brokers in Wall Street, New York City, 1920.jpg|thumb|350px|Curb brokers in Wall Street, New York City, 1920, a year before the trading was moved indoors. That year, journalist Edwin C. Hill described the curb trading on lower Broad Street as &quot;a roaring, swirling whirlpool... like nothing else under the astonishing sky that is its only roof.”&lt;ref name=nyt-stock-cold/&gt;]]
The exchange grew out of the loosely organized [[curb market]] of [[curbstone broker]]s on [[Broad Street (Manhattan)|Broad Street]] in [[Manhattan]]. Efforts to organize and standardize the market started early in the 20th century under [[Emanuel S. Mendels]] and [[Carl H. Pforzheimer]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=F92F1rvEt4UC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;lpg=PA178&amp;dq=carl+pforzheimer+curb+exchange&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6nrYcotZG0&amp;sig=6gUb0AtyA14N15TfUY4qEXJ96gM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DF6xT_adDMjYiAKX6tiLAw&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=carl%20pforzheimer%20curb%20exchange&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The curb brokers had been kicked out of the Mills Building front by 1907, and had moved to the pavement outside the [[Blair Building]] where cabbies lined up. There they were given a &quot;little domain of asphalt&quot; fenced off by the police on Broad Street between Exchange Place and Beaver Street.&lt;ref name=nyt-complaints/&gt; As of 1907, the curb market operated starting at 10'clock in the morning, each day except [[Sundays]], until a gong at 3 o'clock. Orders for the purchase and sale of securities were shouted down from the windows of nearby brokerages, with the execution of the sale then shouted back up to the brokerage.&lt;ref name=nyt-complaints&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Asks Bingham to Oust Curb Brokers; Lawyer Allen Says Open-Air Exchange Is a Public Nuisance and Therefore Illegal. He Cites Many Decisions And Will Press His Contention -- Brokers Forced to Move Many Times Owing to Complaints. |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A0CEFDF103EE033A25754C1A96E9C946697D6CF&amp;legacy=true | work=[[The New York Times]] |location=New York City, New York |date=August 17, 1907 |page=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizing and 'Curb list'===
As of 1907, E. S. Mendels gave the brokers rules &quot;by right of seniority&quot;, but the curb brokers intentionally avoided organizing. According to the ''Times'', this came from a general belief that if a curb exchange was organized, the exchange authorities would force members to sell their other exchange memberships.&lt;ref name=nyt-complaints/&gt; However, in 1908 the '''New York Curb Market Agency''' was established, which developed appropriate trading rules for curbstone brokers, organized by Mendels.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;  The informal '''Curb Association''' formed in 1910 to weed out undesirables.&lt;ref name=nyt-stock-cold/&gt; The curb exchange was for years at odds with the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE), or &quot;Big Board&quot;, operating several buildings away. Explained the ''New York Times'' in 1910, the Big Board looked at the curb as &quot;a trading place for 'cats and dogs.'&quot;&lt;ref name=nyt-curb-out/&gt; On April 1, 1910, however, when the NYSE abolished its unlisted department, the NYSE stocks &quot;made homeless by the abolition&quot; were &quot;refused domicile&quot; by the curb brokers on Broad Street until they had complied with the &quot;Curb list&quot; of requirements.&lt;ref name=nyt-curb-out&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Curb Bars Stocks Big Board Dropped; Securities Shut Out by Abolition of Unlisted Department Are Homeless Now. |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9503EFD91139E333A25751C0A9629C946196D6CF&amp;legacy=true | work=[[The New York Times]] |location=New York City, New York |date=April 2, 1901 |page=1|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, Mendels and his advisers drew up a constitution and formed the '''New York Curb Market Association''', which can be considered the first formal constitution of American Stock Exchange.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;http://abcnewspapers.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=11281 New York Curb Market Association&lt;/ref&gt;

===1920s-1940s: Move indoors===
[[File:American stock exchange NYC.jpg|thumb|right|240px|American Stock Exchange building, constructed in 1921.]]
In 1920, journalist Edwin C. Hill wrote that the curb exchange on lower Broad Street was a roaring, swirling whirlpool” that &quot;tears control of a gold-mine from an unlucky operator, then pauses to auction a puppy-dog. It is like nothing else under the astonishing sky that is its only roof.” After a group of Curb brokers formed a real estate company to design a building, [[Starrett &amp; Van Vleck]] designed the [[American Stock Exchange Building|new exchange building]] on [[Greenwich Street]] in [[Lower Manhattan]] between Thames and Rector, at 86 Trinity Place. It opened in 1921,&lt;ref name=nyt-stock-cold/&gt; and the curbstone brokers moved indoors on June 27, 1921.{{cn|date=April 2017}} In 1929, the New York Curb Market changed its name to the New York Curb Exchange. Within no time, the Curb Exchange became the leading international stock market, listing more foreign issues than all other U.S. securities markets combined.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

[[George Rea]] was approached about the position of president of the New York Curb Exchange in 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;curb exchange&quot;&gt;{{cite news|date=April 21, 1939 |title=G. P.

He was paid $25,000 per year and held the position for 3 years before offering his resignation in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=April 8, 1942 |title=Rea Quits as Curb Exchange Head Effective June 30, After 3 Years |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F1081EFE3E5D167B93CAA9178FD85F468485F9&amp;scp=10&amp;sq=George+Rea&amp;st=p |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2008-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the position having &quot;done such a good job that there is virtually no need for a full-time successor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=July 13, 1942 |title=First Is Last |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,884565,00.html |work=Time |accessdate=2008-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modernization as the American Stock Exchange===
In 1953 the Curb Exchange was renamed the American Stock Exchange.{{cn|date=April 2017}} The exchange was shaken by a scandal in 1961, and in 1962 began a reorganization.&lt;ref name=nyt-verylarge/&gt; Its reputation recently damaged by charges of mismanagement, in 1962 the [[American Stock Exchange]] named [[Edwin Etherington]] its president. Writes [[CNN]], he and executive vice president [[Paul Kolton]] were &quot;tapped in 1962 to clean up and reinvigorate the scandal-plagued American Stock Exchange.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://money.cnn.com/2001/01/12/markets/q_kandel/&lt;/ref&gt; At AMEX for five years, he was credited with improving opportunities for minorities and women.{{cn|date=April 2017}} In 1971, [[Johnson Products Company]] became the first African American-owned company to be listed on the [[American Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JohnsonProducts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnsonproducts.com/heritage.html |title=The Father of Hair Care |publisher=Johnson Products |accessdate=2008-06-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331120921/http://www.johnsonproducts.com/heritage.html |archivedate=2008-03-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1971, it was the second largest stock exchange in the United States. Paul Kolton succeeded Ralph S. Saul as AMEX president on June 17, 1971,&lt;ref name=nyt-verylarge&gt;

In 1977, [[Thomas Peterffy]] purchased a seat on the [[American Stock Exchange]] and played a role in developing the [[electronic trading]] of [[Security (finance)|securities]]. Peterffy created a major stir among traders by introducing handheld computers onto the trading floor in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forbes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/thomas-peterffy/ |title=Thomas Peterffy |publisher=[[Forbes]] |date=2016 |accessdate=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Business&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/photo-essays/2010-12-06/twenty-billionaires-who-started-with-nothing |title=Twenty Billionaires Who Started With Nothing - Living the American Dream - Businessweek (#17) |publisher=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |date=2010-12-06 |accessdate=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard F. Syron]] joined the American Stock Exchange as CEO in 1994 held that post for five years, which included its merger in 1998 into the [[National Association of Securities Dealers]].{{cn|date=April 2017}}

===NYSE merger===
As of 2003, AMEX was the only U.S. stock market to permit the transmission of buy and sell orders through [[Hand signaling (open outcry)|hand signals]].&lt;ref&gt;Larry Harris, ''Trading and Exchanges'', Oxford University Press US: 2003, page 104, {{ISBN|0-19-514470-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-514470-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008 [[NYSE Euronext]] completed acquisition of the AMEX for $260 million in stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nyse.com/press/1222772889985.html | title=NYSE Euronext Completes Acquisition of American Stock Exchange| publisher = [[New York Stock Exchange]] | date= October 1, 2008 | archive-url =https://wayback.archive.org/web/20081008051922/http://www.nyse.com:80/press/1222772889985.html | archive-date = October 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the closing of the acquisition, NYSE Euronext announced that the AMEX would be integrated with the [[Alternext]] European [[Market capitalization#Market cap terms|small-cap]] exchange and renamed the NYSE Alternext U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date= July 7, 2008| url=http://traderupdates.nyse.com/2008/07/notice_of_upcoming_nyse_system.html| title=Notice of Upcoming NYSE System Changes To Support the NYSE/Amex Integration (NYSE Alternext U.S.)| publisher = [[New York Stock Exchange]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Stock Exchange merged with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE Euronext) on October 1, 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;amex_info&quot;/&gt; Post merger, the Amex equities business was branded &quot;NYSE Alternext US&quot;. As part of the re-branding exercise, NYSE Alternext US was re-branded as NYSE Amex Equities.&lt;ref name=&quot;amex_info&quot;/&gt; On December 1, 2008, the Curb Exchange building at 86 Trinity Place was closed, and the Amex Equities trading floor was moved to the NYSE Trading floor at 11 [[Wall Street]].&lt;ref name=&quot;amex_info&quot;/&gt; 90 years after its 1921 opening, the old New York Curb Market building was empty but remained standing.&lt;ref name=nyt-stock-cold&gt;{{cite news |author=When Stocks Came in From the Cold |title=Christopher Gray |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/realestate/03scapes.html | work=[[The New York Times]] |location=New York City, New York |date=September 30, 2010 |page=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, NYSE Alternext U.S. was changed to NYSE Amex Equities.  On May 10, 2012, NYSE Amex Equities changed its name to NYSE MKT LLC.&lt;ref name=&quot;amex_info&quot;/&gt;

In June 2016, a competing stock exchange [[IEX]] (which operated with a 350-microsecond delay in trading), gained approval from the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]], despite lobbying protests by the NYSE and other exchanges and trading firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Popper | first =Nathaniel  | title =IEX Group, Critical of Wall St., Gains Approval for Stock Exchange | newspaper =[[The New York Times]] | publisher =[[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.]] | date =2016-06-17 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/18/business/dealbook/iex-group-gains-approval-for-stock-exchange.html | access-date = 2017-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently the NYSE renamed NYSE MKT to NYSE American, and announced plans to introduce its own 350-microsecond &quot;speed bump&quot; in trading on the small and mid-cap company exchange.&lt;ref name=american /&gt;&lt;ref name=upstart /&gt;&lt;ref name=crush /&gt;
