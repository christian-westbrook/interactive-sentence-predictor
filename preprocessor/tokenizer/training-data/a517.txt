The '''geography of Antarctica''' is dominated by its [[polar region|south polar location]] and, thus, by [[ice]].  The [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] [[continent]], located in the [[Earth]]'s [[southern hemisphere]], is centered asymmetrically around the [[South Pole]] and largely south of the [[Antarctic Circle]].  It is washed by the [[Southern Ocean|Southern (or Antarctic) Ocean]] or, depending on definition, the southern [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], and [[Indian Ocean]]s. It has an area of more than 14 million&amp;nbsp;km².

Some 98% of Antarctica is covered by the [[Antarctic ice sheet]], the world's largest [[ice sheet]] and also its largest reservoir of [[fresh water]].  Averaging at least 1.6&amp;nbsp;km thick, the ice is so massive that it has [[post-glacial rebound|depressed the continental bedrock]] in some areas more than 2.5&amp;nbsp;km below sea level; subglacial lakes of liquid water also occur (e.g., [[Lake Vostok]]).  [[Ice shelf|Ice shelves]] and [[ice rise|rises]] populate the ice sheet on the periphery.

Physically, Antarctica is divided in two by [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. [[Western Antarctica]] and [[Eastern Antarctica]] correspond roughly to the eastern and western hemispheres relative to the [[Prime Meridian|Greenwich meridian]]. This usage has been regarded as [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] by some, and the alternative terms Lesser Antarctica and Greater Antarctica (respectively) are sometimes preferred.

Lesser Antarctica is covered by the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. There has been some concern about this [[ice sheet]], because there is a small chance that it will collapse. If it does, ocean levels would rise by a few metres in a very short period of time.

==Volcanoes==
There are four volcanoes on the mainland of Antarctica that are
considered to be active on the basis of observed fumarolic activity or
&quot;recent&quot; tephra deposits:
[[Mount Melbourne]] (2,730 m) (74°21'S., 164°42'E.), a stratovolcano;
[[Mount Berlin]] (3,500 m) (76°03'S., 135°52'W.), a stratovolcano;
Mount Kauffman (2,365 m) (75°37'S., 132°25'W.), a stratovolcano; and
[[Mount Hampton]] (3,325 m) (76°29'S., 125°48'W.), a volcanic caldera.

Several volcanoes on offshore islands have records of historic activity.
[[Mount Erebus]] (3,795 m), a stratovolcano on
[[Ross Island]] with 10 known eruptions and 1 suspected eruption.
On the opposite side of the continent,
[[Deception Island]]
(62°57'S., 60°38'W.), a volcanic caldera with 10 known
and 4 suspected eruptions, have been the most active.
[[Buckle Island]] in the [[Balleny Islands]] (66°50'S., 163°12'E.),
[[Penguin Island (South Shetland Islands)|Penguin Island]] (62°06'S., 57°54'W.),
[[Paulet Island]] (63°35'S., 55°47'W.), and
[[Lindenberg Island]] (64°55'S., 59°40'W.) are also
considered to be active. In 2017, the researchers of [[Edinburgh University]] discovered 91 underwater volcanoes under [[West Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/12/scientists-discover-91-volcanos-antarctica|title=Scientists discover 91 volcanoes below Antarctic ice sheet|last=McKie|first=Robin|date=2017-08-12|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-16|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ed.ac.uk/news/2017/student-s-idea-leads-to-antarctic-volcano-discover|title=Student’s idea leads to Antarctic volcano discovery|work=The University of Edinburgh|access-date=2017-08-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
