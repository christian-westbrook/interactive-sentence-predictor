<text xml:space="preserve">'''Ammonius Hermiae''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|m|oʊ|n|i|ə|s}}; {{lang-el|Ἀμμώνιος ὁ Ἑρμείου}}; {{circa|440|520}} AD) was a [[Byzantine Empire|Greek]] [[philosopher]], and the son of the [[Neoplatonist]] philosophers [[Hermias (philosopher)|Hermias]] and [[Aedesia]]. He was a pupil of [[Proclus]] in [[Athens]], and taught at [[Alexandria]] for most of his life, writing commentaries on [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and other philosophers.

==Life==
Ammonius' father, [[Hermias (philosopher)|Hermias]], died when he was a child, and his mother, Aedesia, raised him and his brother, [[Heliodorus of Alexandria|Heliodorus]], in [[Alexandria]]. When they reached adulthood, Aedesia accompanied her sons to [[Athens]] where they studied under [[Proclus]]. Eventually, they returned to Alexandria, where Ammonius, as head of the Neoplatonist school in Alexandria, lectured on [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] for the rest of his life. According to [[Damascius]], during the persecution of the [[paganism|pagans]] at Alexandria in the late 480's, Ammonius made concessions to the [[Christian]] authorities so that he could continue his lectures.&lt;ref&gt;Damascius, ''Philosophos Historia'', 118B, Athanassiadi&lt;/ref&gt; Damascius, who scolds Ammonius for the agreement that he made, does not say what the concessions were, but it may have involved limitations on the doctrines he could teach or promote. He was still teaching in 515; [[Olympiodorus the Younger|Olympiodorus]] heard him lecture on [[Plato]]'s ''Gorgias'' in that year.&lt;ref&gt;Olympiodorus, ''in Gorgias'', 199, 8–10&lt;/ref&gt; He also taught [[Asclepius of Tralles]], [[John Philoponus]], [[Damascius]] and [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Ammonius Hermiae|volume=1|page=864}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was also an accomplished [[astronomer]]; he lectured on [[Ptolemy]] and is known to have written a treatise on the [[astrolabe]].

==Writings==
[[File:Ammonios Hermeiou.jpg|thumb|right|First page of the first edition of the ''Isagoge'' commentary, Venice 1500]]
Of his reputedly numerous writings, only his commentary on Aristotle's ''De Interpretatione'' survives intact. A commentary on [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s ''[[Isagoge]]'' may also be his, but it is somewhat corrupt and contains later interpolations.

In ''De Interpretatione,'' Ammonius contends that divine foreknowledge makes void the contingent. Like
[[Boethius|Boëthius]] in his second ''Commentary'' and ''[[The Consolation of Philosophy]],'' this argument maintains the effectiveness of prayer. Ammonius cites [[Iamblichus]] who said &quot;knowledge is intermediate between the knower and the known, since it is the activity of the knower concerning the known.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
''Medieval Philosophy and the Classical Tradition'', Curzon Press, John Inglis, 2002, pg. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there are some notes of Ammonius' lectures written by various students which also survive:

*On Aristotle's ''Categories'' (anonymous writer)
*On Aristotle's ''Prior Analytics I'' (anonymous writer)
*On Aristotle's ''Metaphysics 1–7'' (written by [[Asclepius of Tralles|Asclepius]])
*On [[Nicomachus]]' ''Introduction to Arithmetic'' (written by Asclepius)
*On Aristotle's ''Prior Analytics'' (written by [[John Philoponus]])
*On Aristotle's ''Posterior Analytics'' (written by John Philoponus)
*On Aristotle's ''On Generation and Corruption'' (written by John Philoponus)
*On Aristotle's ''On the Soul'' (written by John Philoponus)

There is Greek-language work called ''Life of Aristotle'', which is usually ascribed to Ammonius, but &quot;is more probable that it is the work of [[Joannes Philoponus]], the pupil of Ammonius, to whom it is ascribed in some [[Manuscript|MSS]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=p5VUAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq= ''The biographical dictionary of the Society for the diffusion of useful knowledge'', Volume 2, Part 2], Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans, 1843, p. 487.&lt;/ref&gt;
