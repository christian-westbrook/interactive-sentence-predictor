'''Alcuin of York''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|k|w|ɪ|n}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/alcuin &quot;Alcuin&quot;, Oxford dictionaries]&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-la|Flaccus Albinus Alcuinus}}; {{circa}} 735 – 19 May 804 AD)—also called '''Ealhwine''', '''Alhwin''' or '''Alchoin'''—was an English scholar, clergy, poet and teacher from [[York]], [[Northumbria]]. He was born around 735 and became the student of [[Ecgbert (Archbishop of York)|Archbishop Ecgbert]] at York. At the invitation of [[Charlemagne]], he became a leading scholar and teacher at the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian court]], where he remained a figure in the 780s and '90s.

Alcuin wrote many theological and dogmatic treatises, as well as a few grammatical works and a number of poems. He was made Abbot of [[Tours]] in 796, where he remained until his death. &quot;The most learned man anywhere to be found&quot;, according to [[Einhard]]'s ''[[Vita Karoli Magni|Life of Charlemagne]]''&lt;ref&gt;Einhard, ''Life of Charlemagne'', §25.&lt;/ref&gt; (''ca.'' 817-833), he is considered among the most important architects of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. Among his pupils were many of the dominant intellectuals of the Carolingian era.

==Biography==

===Background===
[[File:AT 13763 Roof figures at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna-8.jpg|thumb|upright|Alcuin, roof figure, Museum of History of Arts, Vienna.]]
Alcuin was born in [[Northumbria]], presumably sometime in the 730s. Virtually nothing is known of his parents, family background, or origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bullough, Alcuin, p. 164&quot;&gt;Bullough 2003, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; In common hagiographical fashion, the ''Vita Alcuini'' asserts that Alcuin was 'of noble English stock,' and this statement has usually been accepted by scholars. Alcuin's own work only mentions such collateral kinsmen as Wilgils, father of the missionary saint [[Willibrord]]; and Beornred, abbot of Echternach and bishop of Sens, who was more distantly related.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bullough 2003, pp. 146–7, 165&quot;&gt;Bullough 2003, pp. 146–7, 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Life'' of St Willibrord, Alcuin writes that Wilgils, called a ''paterfamilias'', had founded an oratory and church at the mouth of the [[Humber]], which had fallen into Alcuin's possession by inheritance. Because in early Anglo-Latin writing ''paterfamilias'' (&quot;head of a family, householder&quot;) usually referred to a [[churl|ceorl]], [[Donald A. Bullough]] suggests that Alcuin's family was of [[churl|cierlisc]] status: ''i.e.,'' free but subordinate to a noble lord, and that Alcuin and other members of his family rose to prominence through beneficial connections with the aristocracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bullough 2003, pp. 146–7, 165&quot;/&gt; If so, Alcuin's origins may lie in the southern part of what was formerly known as [[Deira]].&lt;ref&gt;Bullough 2003, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

===York===
The young Alcuin came to the [[cathedral church]] of [[York]] during the golden age of Archbishop [[Ecgbert, Archbishop of York|Ecgbert]] and his brother, the Northumbrian King [[Eadberht of Northumbria|Eadberht]]. Ecgbert had been a disciple of the [[Bede|Venerable Bede]], who urged him to raise York to an [[archbishopric]]. King Eadberht and Archbishop Ecgbert oversaw the re-energising and re-organisation of the [[History of the Church of England|English church]], with an emphasis on reforming the clergy and on the tradition of learning that Bede had begun. Ecgbert was devoted to Alcuin, who thrived under his tutelage.

The York school was renowned as a centre of learning in the liberal arts, literature, and science, as well as in religious matters.&lt;ref name=RenewAmerica&gt;{{cite web|title=A cure for the educational crisis: Learn from the extraordinary educational heritage of the West |work=RenewAmerica analyst |url=http://www.renewamerica.us/analyses/060601hutchison.htm |accessdate=2 June 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060602171225/http://www.renewamerica.us/analyses/060601hutchison.htm |archivedate=2 June 2006 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was from here that Alcuin drew inspiration for the school he would lead at the [[Franks|Frankish]] court. He revived the school with the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] and [[quadrivium]] disciplines,&lt;ref name=Burns&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01276a.htm Burns, James. &quot;Alcuin.&quot; The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 29 Nov. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; writing a [[codex]] on the trivium, while his student [[Rabanus Maurus|Hraban]] wrote one on the quadrivium.

Alcuin graduated to become a teacher during the 750s. His ascendancy to the headship of the York school, the ancestor of [[St Peter's School, York|St Peter's School]], began after [[Ethelbert of York|Aelbert]] became Archbishop of York in 767. Around the same time Alcuin became a [[deacon]] in the church. He was never ordained a priest. Though there is no real evidence that he took monastic vows, he lived as if he had.

In 781, King [[Ælfwald I of Northumbria|Elfwald]] sent Alcuin to Rome to petition the Pope for official confirmation of York's status as an archbishopric and to confirm the election of the new archbishop, [[Eanbald I]]. On his way home he met Charlemagne (whom he had met once before), this time in the Italian city of [[Parma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=Alcuin, Charlemagne, and the problem of sanctions|first=Henry|last=Mayr-Harting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VwK6qHH81oC&amp;pg=PA207|pages=207–218|title=Early Medieval Studies in Memory of Patrick Wormald|series=Studies in Early Medieval Britain|editor-first=Stephen David|editor-last=Baxter|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=2009|isbn=9780754663317}}.

===Charlemagne===
Alcuin's intellectual curiosity allowed him to be reluctantly persuaded to join Charlemagne's court. He joined an illustrious group of scholars that Charlemagne had gathered around him, the mainsprings of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]: [[Peter of Pisa]], [[Saint Paulinus II|Paulinus of Aquileia]], Rado, and [[Saint Fulrad|Abbot Fulrad]]. Alcuin would later write that &quot;the Lord was calling me to the service of King Charles.&quot;

Alcuin became Master of the [[Charlemagne's Palace in Aachen|Palace]] School of Charlemagne in [[Aachen]] (''Urbs Regale'') in 782.&lt;ref name=Burns/&gt; It had been founded by the king's ancestors as a place for the education of the royal children (mostly in manners and the ways of the court). However, Charlemagne wanted to include the [[liberal arts]] and, most importantly, the study of religion. From 782 to 790, Alcuin taught Charlemagne himself, his sons [[Pepin the Hunchback|Pepin]] and [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], as well as young men sent to be educated at court, and the young clerics attached to the [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen|palace chapel]]. Bringing with him from York his assistants Pyttel, Sigewulf, and Joseph, Alcuin revolutionised the educational standards of the Palace School, introducing Charlemagne to the liberal arts and creating a personalised atmosphere of scholarship and learning, to the extent that the institution came to be known as the 'school of Master Albinus'.

In this role as adviser, he took issue with the emperor's policy of forcing pagans to be baptised on pain of death, arguing, &quot;Faith is a free act of the will, not a forced act. We must appeal to the conscience, not compel it by violence. You can force people to be baptised, but you cannot force them to believe.&quot; His arguments seem to have prevailed – Charlemagne abolished the death penalty for paganism in 797.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Dr. N.R., ''Two Thousand Years of Christ's Power, Part Two: The Middle Ages'', Grace Publications, 2000, page 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlemagne gathered the best men of every land in his court, and became far more than just the king at the centre. It seems that he made many of these men his closest friends and counsellors. They referred to him as 'David', a reference to the Biblical king [[David (biblical king)|David]]. Alcuin soon found himself on intimate terms with Charlemagne and the other men at court, where pupils and masters were known by affectionate and jesting nicknames.&lt;ref name=wilmot&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilmot-Buxton|first=E.M.|title=Alcuin|year=1922|publisher=P.J. Kenedy &amp; Sons|location=New York|page=93|url=https://archive.org/stream/alcuin__00wilm#page/92/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcuin himself was known as 'Albinus' or 'Flaccus'. While at [[Aachen]], Alcuin bestowed pet names upon his pupils – derived mainly from [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Eclogues]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Jaegar, ''Enobling love: in search of a lost sensibility'' (University of Pennsylvania, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', &quot;He loved Charlemagne and enjoyed the king’s esteem, but his letters reveal that his fear of him was as great as his love.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

===Return to Northumbria and back to Francia===
In 790 Alcuin returned from the court of Charlemagne to England, to which he had remained attached. He dwelt there for some time, but Charlemagne then invited him back to help in the fight against the [[Adoptionism|Adoptionist]] heresy which was at that time making great progress in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], the old capital of the [[Visigoths]] and still a major city for the Christians under [[Al-Andalus|Islamic rule in Spain]]. He is believed to have had contacts with [[Beatus of Liébana]], from the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], who fought against Adoptionism. At the [[Council of Frankfurt]] in 794, Alcuin upheld the orthodox doctrine against the views expressed by [[Felix, Bishop of Urgel|Felix of Urgel]], an [[heresiarch]] according to the Catholic Encyclopaedia.&lt;ref name=Burns/&gt; Having failed during his stay in Northumbria to influence King [[Æthelred I of Northumbria|Æthelred]] in the conduct of his reign, Alcuin never returned home.

He was back at Charlemagne's court by at least mid-792, writing a series of letters to Æthelred, to Hygbald, Bishop of [[Lindisfarne]], and to [[Æthelhard]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in the succeeding months, dealing with the [[Viking]] attack on Lindisfarne in July 793. These letters and Alcuin's poem on the subject, ''De clade Lindisfarnensis monasterii'', provide the only significant contemporary account of these events. In his description of the Viking attack, he wrote: &quot;''Never before has such terror appeared in Britain. Behold the church of [[St Cuthbert]], splattered with the blood of God's priests, robbed of its ornaments''.&quot;

===Tours and death===
In 796 Alcuin was in his sixties. He hoped to be free from court duties and upon the death of Abbot Itherius of Saint Martin at Tours, Charlemagne put [[Marmoutier Abbey, Tours|Marmoutier Abbey]] into Alcuin's care, with the understanding that he should be available if the king ever needed his counsel. There he encouraged the work of the monks on the beautiful Carolingian minuscule script, ancestor of modern Roman typefaces.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alcuin &quot;Alcuin&quot;, ''Ecyclopedia Britannica'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcuin died on 19 May 804, some ten years before the emperor, and was buried at St. Martin's Church under an epitaph that partly read:
{{quote|Dust, worms, and ashes now&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt; Alcuin my name, wisdom I always loved,&lt;br /&gt; Pray, reader, for my soul.}}

The majority of details on Alcuin's life come from his letters and poems. There are also autobiographical sections in Alcuin's poem on York and in the ''Vita Alcuini'', a ''[[hagiography|Life]]'' written for him at Ferrières in the 820s, possibly based in part on the memories of Sigwulf, one of Alcuin's pupils.

===Mathematician===
{{Main|Propositiones ad acuendos juvenes}}
The collection of mathematical and logical word problems entitled ''Propositiones ad acuendos juvenes'' (&quot;Problems to Sharpen Youths&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;propositiones&quot;&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/X/LAT0602.HTM The first few problems of Alcuin's on original Latin] (English: ''Problems to sharpen the young'',  proper title ''Propositiones Alcuini Doctoris Caroli Magni Imperatoris ad Acuendes Juvenes''—''Propositions of Alcuin, A Teacher of Emperor Charlemagne, for Sharpening Youths'')&lt;/ref&gt; is sometimes attributed to Alcuin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson-2005&quot;&gt;[http://www.maa.org/mathland/mathtrek_11_21_05.html Ivars Peterson's MathTrek Nov 21, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson-2005&quot;&gt;Atkinson, L. 2005. 'When the Pope was a mathematician'. ''College Mathematics Journal'' '''36''' (November): 354–362&lt;/ref&gt; In a 799 letter to Charlemagne the scholar claimed to have sent &quot;certain figures of arithmetic for the joy of cleverness,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Epistola'' 172, MGH ''Epistolae'' 4.2: 285: &quot;aliquas figuras arithmeticae subtilitatis laetitiae causa&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; which some scholars have identified with the ''Propositiones.''&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Hélène Jullien and Françoise Perelman, eds., Clavis scriptorum latinorum medii aevi: Auctores Galliae 735–987. Tomus II: Alcuinus. Turnhout: Brepols, 1999, 482–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A more skeptical attitude toward Alcuin's authorship of this text and others is taken by Michael Gorman, &quot;Alcuin Before Migne,&quot; ''Revue bénédictine'' 112 (2002); 101–130.&lt;/ref&gt;
The text contains about 53 mathematical word problems (with solutions), in no particular pedagogical order. Among the most famous of these problems are: four that involve [[river crossing problem|river crossings]], including the [[Jealous husbands problem|problem of three anxious brothers]], each of whom has an unmarried sister whom he cannot leave alone with either of the other men lest she be defiled&lt;ref name=&quot;3-brothers&quot;&gt;[http://logica.ugent.be/albrecht/alcuin.pdf Latin title and English text of the problem]&lt;/ref&gt; (Problem 17); the [[Fox, goose and bag of beans puzzle|problem of the wolf, goat, and cabbage]] (Problem 18); and the problem of &quot;the two adults and two children where the children weigh half as much as the adults&quot; (Problem 19). [[Alcuin's sequence]] is the solution to one of the problems of that book.

===Literary influence===
Alcuin made the abbey school into a model of excellence and many students flocked to it. He had many manuscripts copied using outstandingly beautiful [[calligraphy]], the [[Carolingian minuscule]] based on round and legible [[uncial]] letters. He wrote many letters to his English friends, to [[Arno of Salzburg|Arno, bishop of Salzburg]] and above all to [[Charlemagne]]. These letters (of which 311 are extant) are filled mainly with pious meditations, but they form an important source of information as to the literary and social conditions of the time and are the most reliable authority for the history of [[humanism]] during the [[Carolingian]] age. Alcuin trained the numerous monks of the abbey in piety, and it was in the midst of these pursuits that he died.

Alcuin is the most prominent figure of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], in which three main periods have been distinguished: in the first of these, up to the arrival of Alcuin at the court, the Italians occupy a central place; in the second, Alcuin and the [[Anglo-Saxons]] are dominant; in the third (from 804), the influence of [[Theodulf of Orléans|Theodulf, the Visigoth]] is preponderant.

Alcuin also developed manuals used in his educational work – a [[grammar]] and works on [[rhetoric]] and [[dialectics]]. These are written in the form of [[dialogues]], and in two of them the interlocutors are Charlemagne and Alcuin. He wrote several [[theological]] treatises: a ''De fide Trinitatis'', and commentaries on the Bible.&lt;ref name=Page&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/lettersofalcuin00pageuoft#page/14/mode/2up Page, Rolph Barlow. ''The Letters of Alcuin'', p.15, New York 1909]&lt;/ref&gt; Alcuin is credited with inventing the first known [[question mark]], though it didn't resemble the modern symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Lynne Truss. ''Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves'', 2003. p. 76. {{ISBN|1-59240-087-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcuin transmitted to the [[Franks]] the knowledge of Latin culture which had existed in Anglo-Saxon England. A number of his works still exist. Besides some graceful epistles in the style of [[Venantius Fortunatus]], he wrote some long poems, and notably he is the author of a history (in verse) of the church at York, ''Versus de patribus, regibus et sanctis Eboracensis ecclesiae''.

=== Use of homo-erotic language in writings ===
Passages in Alcuin's writings have been seen to exhibit [[homosocial]] desire, possibly even homoerotic imagery. David Clark suggests it is not possible to determine whether Alcuin's homosocial desires were the result of an outward expression of erotic feelings.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;David Clark, ''Between Medieval Men: Male Friendship and desire in early medieval english''&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[John Boswell]]&lt;ref&gt;John Boswell, ''Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;David Bromell in ''Who's who in Gay and Lesbian History'', London, 2000 (Ed. Wotherspoon and Aldrich)&lt;/ref&gt; cited this as a personal outpouring of Alcuin's internalized [[homosexual]] feelings. Others agree that Alcuin at times &quot;comes perilously close to communicating openly his same sex desires&quot;, and this reflects the erotic subculture of the [[Carolingian]] monastic school, but also perhaps a 'queer space' where &quot;erotic attachment and affections may be safely articulated”.&lt;ref&gt;Lynda L Coon, ''Dark bodies: gender and monastic practice in the early medieval west'' (University of Pennsylvania, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Erotic and religious love are intertwined in Alcuin's writings, and he frequently &quot;eroticizes his personal relationships to his beloved friends”. Alcuin's friendships also extended to the ladies of the court, especially the queen mother and the king's daughters, though his relationships with these women never reached the intense level of those of the men around him.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

The interpretation of homosexual desire has been disputed by [[Allen Frantzen]],&lt;ref&gt;Allen J. Frantzen, ''Before the Closet'', University of Chicago, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;But also Stephen Jaegar, &quot;L'amour des rois&quot;, ''Annales 46'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; who identifies Alcuin's language with that of medieval Christian ''amicitia'' or friendship. Karl Liersch, in his 1880 inaugural dissertation, cites several passages from poems by [[Theodulf of Orleans]]. In these poems Theodulf reports that Alcuin had a female muse named Delia in the king's court (she was probably Charlemagne's daughter). Delia is also the addressee of several poems by Alcuin.&lt;ref&gt;Liersch, Karl: [http://www.mgh.de/bibliothek/opac/?wa72ci_url=/cgi-bin/mgh/regsrchindex.pl?wert%3Dgedichte+theodulfs,+bischofs+von+orleans&amp;recnums=195542&amp;index=1&amp;db=opac Die Gedichte Theodulfs, Bischofs von Orleans], Halle, 1880, p. 49-50&lt;/ref&gt;

David Dales and [[Rowan Williams]] say &quot;the use of language drawn [by Alcuin] from the ''Song of Songs'' transforms apparently erotic language into something within Christian friendship - 'an ordained affection'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dale, David and Williams. Rowan. &quot;The Poet at Work&quot;, ''Alcuin: Theology and Thought'', James Clarke &amp; Co, 2013, {{ISBN|9780227900871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite inconclusive evidence of Alcuin's personal passions, he was clear in his own writings that the men of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] had been punished with fire for &quot;sinning against nature with men&quot; - a view commonly held by the Church at the time. Such sins, argued Alcuin, were therefore more serious than lustful acts with women, for which the earth was cleansed and revivified by the water of the [[Genesis flood narrative|Flood]], and merit to be &quot;withered by flames unto eternal barrenness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alcuin, &quot;Interrogationes Sigewulfi in Genesin&quot;, J. -P. Migne, ed., ''[https://archive.org/stream/patrologiaecurs171unkngoog#page/n276/mode/2up Patrologiae Cursus Completus]'', Vol. 100, col. 543&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In several churches of the [[Anglican Communion]], Alcuin is celebrated on 20 May, the first available day after the day of his death (as [[Dunstan]] is celebrated on 19 May).{{fact|date=September 2017}}

[[Alcuin College]], one of the [[colleges of the University of York]], England, is named after him.
