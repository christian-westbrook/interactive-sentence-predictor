An '''acropolis''' ([ancient Greek]]: ἀκρόπολις, &lt;small&gt;[[Romanization of Ancient Greek|tr.]]&lt;/small&gt; ''Akrópolis''; from ''ákros'' (άκρος) or ''ákron'' (άκρον) &quot;highest, topmost, outermost&quot; and ''pólis'' &quot;city&quot;; plural in English: ''acropoles'', ''acropoleis'' or ''acropolises'')&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|acropolis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)kro/polis|acropolis}}, {{LSJ|a)/kros|akros}},  {{LSJ|a)/kron|akron|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Human settlement|settlement]], especially a [[citadel]], built upon an area of elevated ground&amp;mdash;frequently a hill with [[precipice|precipitous]] sides, chosen for purposes of defense. In many parts of the world, acropoleis became the nuclei of large cities of [[classical antiquity]], such as [[ancient Rome]], and for this reason they are sometimes prominent landmarks in modern cities with ancient pasts, such as modern [[Rome]].

The word ''acropolis'' literally means in Greek &quot;upper city,&quot; and though associated primarily with the [[Greece|Greek]] cities [[Athens]], [[Argos]] ( with [[Larissa (Argos)|Larissa]]), [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] (with [[Cadmea]]), and [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] (with its [[Acrocorinth]]), may be applied generically to all such citadels, including Rome, [[Jerusalem]], Celtic [[Bratislava]], many in [[Asia Minor]], or even [[Castle Rock, Edinburgh|Castle Rock]] in [[Edinburgh]]. An example in Ireland is the [[Rock of Cashel]]. Acropolis is also the term used by archaeologists and historians for the urban [[Castro culture]] settlements located in Northwestern Iberian hilltops.

The most famous example is the [[Acropolis of Athens]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/404 World Heritage: Acropolis, Athens ]&lt;/ref&gt; which, by reason of its historical associations and the several famous buildings erected upon it (most notably the [[Parthenon]]), is known without qualification as ''the Acropolis''. Although originating in the mainland of Greece, use of the acropolis model quickly spread to Greek colonies such as the [[Dorians|Dorian]] [[Lato]] on [[Crete]] during the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic Period]].

== Metaphorical use in modern times ==

Because of its classical [[Hellenistic]] style, the ruins of [[Mission San Juan Capistrano|Mission San Juan Capistrano's]] Great Stone Church in [[California|California, United States]] has been called the &quot;American Acropolis&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Erik|title=The visionary state : a journey through California's spiritual landscape|date=2006|publisher=Chronicle Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0811848353|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other parts of the world developed other names for the high citadel or [[alcázar]], which often reinforced a naturally strong site. In Central [[Italy]], many small rural [[comune|communes]] still cluster at the base of a fortified habitation known as ''La Rocca'' of the commune.

The term ''acropolis'' is also used to describe the central complex of overlapping structures, such as plazas and pyramids, in many [[Maya city|Maya cities]], including [[Tikal]] and [[Copán]].
