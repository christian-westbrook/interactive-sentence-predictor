An '''adventure''' is an exciting or unusual experience. It may also be a bold, usually [[risk]]y undertaking, with an uncertain outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/adventure |title=Adventure |work=dictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger such as [[traveling]], [[exploring]], [[skydiving]], [[mountain climbing]], [[scuba diving]], [[river rafting]] or participating in [[extreme sports]]. The term also broadly refers to any enterprise that is potentially fraught with physical, financial or psychological risk, such as a business venture, or other major life undertakings.

The word '''adventuress''' can mean a female who enjoys or partakes in adventures, but (particularly in older literature) it can also have the negative connotation of one who schemes for material advancement by the use her sexuality; a [[gold digging|gold digger]]&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', &quot;adventuress&quot;; ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary'', &quot;adventuress&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;  As an instance of the latter the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' cites &quot;Our Adventuress had the pickings of a few Feathers from an old Gentleman who fell in Love with her&quot;.

==Motivation==
Adventurous experiences create psychological [[arousal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YjcgAn8TfsC&amp;pg=PA187 |title=On the psychobiology of personality |chapter=Sensation Seeking and Participation in Physical Risk Sports |author=M Gomà-i-Freixanet |year=2004 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-08-044209-9 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be interpreted as negative (e.g. [[fear]]) or positive (e.g. [[flow (psychology)|flow]]).  For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself. According to adventurer [[André Malraux]], in his ''La Condition Humaine'' (1933), &quot;If a man is not ready to risk his life, where is his dignity?&quot;.{{full|date=June 2013}} Similarly, [[Helen Keller]] stated that &quot;Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keller|first=Helen|title=The Open Door|year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of [[recreation]] or [[wikt:excitement|excitement]]: examples are [[adventure racing]] and [[Adventure travel|adventure tourism]]. Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers – the British adventurer [[Jason Lewis (adventurer)|Jason Lewis]], for example, uses adventures to draw global [[sustainability]] lessons from living within finite environmental constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren. [[Adventure education]] intentionally uses challenging experiences for [[learning]].

==Adventure in mythology and fiction==
Some of the oldest and most widespread stories in the world are stories of adventure such as [[Homer]]'s ''[[The Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/books/review/Mansbach-t.html|title=Odysseus Remixed|author=Adam Mansbach|date=12 February 2010|newspaper=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard Jenkyns |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/31/reviews/fagles-odyssey.html |title=Heroic Enterprise – (Book review: The Odyssey translated by Robert Fagles) |publisher=nytimes.com |date=1996-12-22 |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zweig, P. (1974). ''The adventurer: The fate of adventure in the Western world'', New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[knight errant]] was the form the &quot;adventure seeker&quot; character took in the late Middle Ages.

The [[adventure novel]] exhibits these &quot;protagonist on adventurous journey&quot; characteristics as do many popular feature [[Adventure film|films]], such as ''[[Star Wars]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/26/movies/moviesspecial/26STAR.html|title=A Trip to a Far Galaxy That's Fun and Funny|author=Vincent Canby|date=26 May 1977|newspaper=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173AA42CA1494CC6B6799D836896|title=Movie Review: Raiders of the Lost Ark|author=Vincent Canby|date=12 June 1981|newspaper=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outdoors===
Adventure books may have the theme of the hero or main character going to face the [[wilderness]] or [[Mother Nature]]. Examples include books such as [[Hatchet (book)|Hatchet]] or [[My Side of the Mountain]]. These books are less about &quot;questing&quot;, such as in mythology or other adventure novels, but more about surviving on their own, living off the land, gaining new experiences, and becoming closer to the natural world.
===Questing===
Many adventures are based on the idea of a quest: the hero goes off in pursuit of a reward, whether it be a skill, prize, or perhaps the safety of a person. On the way, the hero must overcome various obstacles. Mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] discussed his notion of the [[monomyth]] in his book, ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''. Campbell proposed that the heroic mythological stories from culture to culture followed a similar underlying pattern, starting with the &quot;call to adventure&quot;, followed by a hazardous journey, and eventual triumph.
===Video games===
Many [[video games]] are adventure games.

==Adventure in nonfiction==
From ancient times, travelers and explorers have written about their adventures. Journals which became best-sellers in their day were written, such as [[Marco Polo]]'s journal ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]'' or [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Roughing It]]''. Others were personal journals, only later published, such as the journals of [[Meriwether Lewis|Lewis]] and [[William Clark|Clark]] or [[Captain James Cook]]'s journals. There are also books written by those not directly a part of the adventure in question, such as [[The Right Stuff (book)|The Right Stuff]] by [[Tom Wolfe]], or books written by those participating in the adventure but in a format other than that of a journal, such as Conquistadors of the Useless by [[Lionel Terray]]. Documentaries often use the theme of adventure as well.

==Adventure sports==
There are many sports classified as adventure sports, due to their inherent danger and excitement. Some of these include [[mountain climbing]], [[skydiving]], or other [[extreme sports]].
